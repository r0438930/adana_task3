It is a large rectangular four-story masonry building, built out of red brick with trim of limestone and gray brick.  Its main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a Tuscan portico with entablature, modillioned cornice, and low balustrade above.  The ground floor is finished in bands of gray brick arranged to appear as rough stone, while the upper floors are red brick with gray brick corner quoining. Limestone stringcourses serve as a water table between the basement and first floor, between the first and second floors, and above the top floor.  The building is crowned by a modillioned and dentillated cornice and a low balustrade.  Windows are set in pairs in each bay, with limestone keystones.<ref name=\"nrhpinv2\"/>\n\nThe international YMCA was founded in Great Britain in 1844, and its first American branch opened in 1851.  [[Anthony Bowen]] founded the first African-American branch of the organization in 1853 in Washington, one year after a branch for whites was opened in the city.  The organization struggled financially in its early years, and was not formally incorporated until 1892.  The organization moved into its first permanent home on 11th Street in 1891, which it soon had sell due to declining membership.  After a membership drive revitalized the organization, it secured a pledge from [[John D. Rockefeller Sr.]] of $25,000, which was matched by fundraising from across the nation's African-American community.  It is believed to be the first such campaign of its type in that community.  This building was completed in 1912 to a design by African-American architect [[William Sidney Pittman]].<ref name=\"nrhpinv2\"/>\n\nIn 1973 Twelfth Street YMCA was officially renamed Anthony Bowen YMCA in honor of its founder.
