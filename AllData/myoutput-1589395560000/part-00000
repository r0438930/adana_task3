It also marks the rise of the widespread adoption of [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] as national policies in Europe. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents.<ref name=\"Mancall1998\">{{cite journal |author1=Peter C.

These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late 19th century, followed by the [[polar exploration|exploration of the polar regions]] in the 20th century.\n\nEuropean overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the [[Old World]] (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the [[New World]] (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian exchange]], a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable diseases]] and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the [[history of cartography|mapping of the world]], resulting in a new worldview and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Explorations english.png|center|thumb|upright=3.4|Map with the main travels of the Age of Discovery.

Later, it was called America, after the name of the explorer Am\u00e9rico Vesp\u00facio, and it was seen as a [[new world]]. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus \u2013 Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.<ref>Diffie, Bailey W. and George D.

Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the \"other sea\" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512.

Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential. Further changing the mercantile situation in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] was the waning of Byzantine naval power following the death of Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] in 1180, whose dynasty had made several notable treaties and concessions with Italian traders, permitting the use of Byzantine Christian ports.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.<ref name=\"Paine_2013\"/>{{rp|316\u201338}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.<ref name=\"Paine_2013\"/>{{rp|328}}\n\n===Technology: ship design and the compass===\n{{Off topic|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Sd11-boom.JPG|thumb|A Caravel with two lateen sail rigs and a [[headsail]].

By the time of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC to 220 AD), the Chinese were using such sails, having learned it from Malay sailors visiting their Southern coast. Beside this type of sail, they also made [[Lug sail|balance lugsails]] ([[tanja sail]]s). The invention of these types of sail made sailing around the western coast of Africa possible, because of their ability to sail against the wind. This type of sail also inspired the Arab of their West and Polynesian of their East to develop [[lateen]] and [[crab claw sail]], respectively.<ref>Shaffer, Lynda Norene (1996).

There, in what came to be called the \"Gold Coast\" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.\n\nIn 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas, 1479.

In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach \"the Indies\" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.<ref>[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.</ref> Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.\n\nOn the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Ni\u00f1a]]''.

It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.\n\nKing [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land\u2014preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.<ref>[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107\u201311.</ref>\n\nAn agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.\n\n[[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this is not considered credible by mainstream historians.\n\nLater the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.\n\n===A New World: The Americas===\n[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseem\u00fcller map]] showing the name \"America\" for the first time.]]\nVery little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground.

In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the \"true indies\", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.<ref>[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.</ref>\n\nThe third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies.

The 1515\u201316 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Sol\u00eds and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.\n\nIn April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large \"[[volta do mar]]\" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).<ref>N. McAlister, Lyle.

Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.\n\nThis round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]].

From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.<ref>[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.</ref>\n\nBetween 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named \"Islands de Sequeira\".<ref>[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168</ref> In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea.

On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]] in 1565.<ref>[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.</ref>\n\n==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519\u20131532)==\nRumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the \"[[conquistadors]]\", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.<ref>[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web</ref>\n\nIn the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.\n\nIn 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.<ref>[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84\u201388.</ref> With three ships and about 200 men, L\u00e9on set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513.

They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Vel\u00e1zquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Vel\u00e1zquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.\n\nIn February 1519 Cort\u00e9s went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucat\u00e1n, in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory,<ref name=\"Grunberg 2007\">[[#Grunberg 2007|Grunberg 2007]], magazine</ref> claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From [[Trinidad]] he proceeded to [[Tabasco]] and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was [[La Malinche]], his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) [[Nahuatl language]] and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Through her, Cort\u00e9s learned about the wealthy [[Aztec Empire]].\n\nIn July his men took over [[Veracruz]] and he placed himself under direct orders of new king [[Charles I of Spain]].<ref name=\"Grunberg 2007\"/> There Cort\u00e9s asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor [[Montezuma II]], who repeatedly refused. They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula '''(Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.\n[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cort\u00e9s' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]\nArriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cort\u00e9s enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.<ref name=\"Grunberg 2007\"/> The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts.

Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pir\u00fa. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about \"Pir\u00fa\" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], caught the attention of Pizarro.\n\n[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the \"''Empresa del Levante''\": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.\n\nOn 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.\n\nPizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''\"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian.\"'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.\n\nThey decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called \"little camels\". The natives named the Spanish \"Children of the Sun\" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.\n\nIn the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulaci\u00f3n de Toledo''<ref>[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.</ref> authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hern\u00e1ndo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].\n\nPizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Hu\u00e1scar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would \"be no man's tributary.\" There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.\n\nIn 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: \"''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''\" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.\n\n==New trade routes (1542\u20131565)==\n[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]\n\nIn 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.<ref>[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88</ref>\n\nThe Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.<ref>N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492\u20131700.'' p. 316.</ref> After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.\n[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]] attributed to [[Kan\u014d Naizen]], 1570\u20131616 Japan]]\n\nHe reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of L\u00f3pez de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.\n\nThus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.\n\n==Northern European involvement (1595 \u2013 17th century)==\n[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the \"first modern atlas\". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]\n\nNations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.\n\nIn 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.\n\nPhilip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.<ref>[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.</ref> Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.\n\nThe emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''\"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten\"'' (''\"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East\"'').<ref>[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book</ref> This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.\n\nDutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.<ref>[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.</ref>\n\n===Exploring North America===\n[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609\u20131611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]\n\nThe 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.</ref> These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520\u20131521 the Portuguese [[Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]<ref>Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004</ref>), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.<ref>''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&redir_esc=y]</ref>\n\nIn 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban G\u00f3mez|Estev\u00e3o Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named \"The Country of Canadas]]\", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.<ref>[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.</ref><ref>[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.</ref>\n\n[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]\n\nEuropeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century.

On 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at South Cove,Cape Arago, just south of [[Coos Bay]], [[Oregon]], and then sailed south while searching for a suitable harbour to repair his ailing ship. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Von der Porten| first1 = Edward | last2 = Aker| first2 = Raymond | last3 = Allen| first3 = Robert W. | last4 = Spitze| first4 = James | title = Who Made Drake's Plate of Brass?

He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].\n\n===Search for a northern route===\n[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]\n\nFrance, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.\n\nIn 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.<ref>[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],</ref> The vessels were separated by \"terrible whirlwinds\" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].\n\n====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====\n5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].<ref>[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258</ref> At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.\n\nThe following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.<ref>[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web</ref> The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] \"wild men\" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.\n\n[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]\n\nThe ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.\n\nIn 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).\n\n===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===\n[[File:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|The route of [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 and 1644 voyages in [[New Holland (Australia)]] in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]])]]\n\n''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, \"the unknown land of the south\") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767<ref>[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.</ref> argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.\n\n[[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.<ref>[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136\u2013246.</ref> [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres|Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. [[Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del [[Espiritu Santo]]. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].\n[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]\n[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning \"Little Dove\"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].<ref>[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.</ref> Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in \"the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands.\" On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.\n\nIn 1642\u20131644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].\n\n==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581\u20131660)==\n{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}\n[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]\nIn the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.\n\n===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===\nAround 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.\n[[File:Yermak Timofeyevich and his band of adventurers crossing the Ural Mountains at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yermak Timofeyevich]] and his band of adventurers crossing the [[Ural Mountains]] at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe]]\n\n===Siberian river routes===\nIn the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by [[Cossacks]] hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While Cossacks came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].\n\nBetween 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy River|Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.\n\nIn 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.<ref>[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62</ref>\n\nYakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.<ref>[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]\nIn 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.<ref>[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247</ref>\n\n===Russians reach the Pacific===\nIn 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.\n\nIn 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.\n\n[[File:Krsk koch.JPG|upright=0.7|thumb|left|A 17th-century [[Koch (boat)|koch]] in a museum in [[Krasnoyarsk]]. Kochi were the earliest [[icebreaker]]s and were widely used by Russians in the [[Arctic]] and on [[Siberia]]n rivers.]]\nIn 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.<ref>[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30</ref> Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].\n\nIn 1649\u201350 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650\u201353. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.<ref>[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web</ref> Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).\n\nIn 1659\u201365 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.\n\nSo, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733\u20131743.\n\n{{further|Major explorations after the Age of Discovery}}\n\n==Global impact==\n{{Main|Columbian Exchange|History of colonialism|Globalization}}\n\n[[File:New World Domesticated plants.JPG|thumb|New World crops.

It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.\n\nThe new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and  hi my name is coco and im here to tell you are mean slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older \"pagan\" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.\n[[File:Namban-08.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Portuguese ''[[wikt:\u5357\u86ee\u4eba|Nanbanjin]]'' arriving at Japan much to the surprise of locals, detail from a [[Nanban trade|Nanban]] panel of the [[Kan\u014d school]], 1593\u20131600]]\nSimilarly, in coastal Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European [[History of slavery|slave traders]], changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of [[African slave trade|African slavery]], causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland.

In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting heavily into China and the foreign trade at large.<ref name=\":0\" /> Trade with [[Early modern Europe|European powers]] and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper [[banknote]]s as the common [[medium of exchange]] in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.\n\n[[File:Jesuites en chine.jpg|thumb|[[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit]] scholars collaborated extensively with Chinese astronomers, introducing [[Copernican principle]]s.

After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.<ref>[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19\u201320.</ref> However, by 1573\u2014after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila\u2014the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.<ref>[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.</ref> Although China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade during the [[global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries|16th to 18th centuries]], Japan's huge contribution of silver exports to China were critical to the world economy and China's liquidity and success with the commodity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis Owen|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391\u2013427|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|issn=1527-8050}}</ref>\n\nItalian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552\u20131610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City. He taught the Chinese how to construct and play the [[spinet]], translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562\u20131633) on mathematical work.\n\n===Economic impact in Europe===\n{{Main|Commercial Revolution|Renaissance|Renaissance in the Low Countries|Great Divergence}}\n{{Renaissance}}\nAs a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for [[luxury good]]s stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.\n\nThe European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became \"the centre of the ''entire'' international economy\",<ref>[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&nbsp;143.</ref> and the richest city in Europe at this time.<ref>[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.</ref> Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], \"[[Dutch Golden Age]]\" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.\n\nDespite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.<ref>[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.</ref> The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.<ref>[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410\u201311.</ref>\n\nFrom China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly-used synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.<ref>For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.</ref> Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.<ref>[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.</ref><ref>[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.</ref> The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]\u2014where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable<ref>[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.</ref>\u2014and ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.\n\n[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559\u20131636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were \"rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it\".<ref>[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205\u2013206.</ref> After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, [[Manila galleon|transported via Manila]]. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.<ref name=\"Ebrey 2006, p. 211\"/>\n\nThe increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.<ref>[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43\u201344</ref> In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potos\u00ed]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. \"I learnt a proverb here\", said a French traveller in 1603: \"Everything is dear in Spain except silver\".<ref>[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.</ref> The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.<ref>[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.</ref> The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.<ref>[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523\u201325</ref> Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial [[middle class]] in Europe, the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.\n\nOne effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long-term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small land-owing farmers such as [[yeoman]] and gentlemen farmers.<ref>\n{{cite book|title= Agricultural Revolution in England: The transformation of the agrarian economy 1500\u20131850|url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521568593|url-access= registration|last=Overton|first= Mark\n|year=1996 |publisher =Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56859-3|pages=}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Kepler-world.jpg|World map from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s [[Rudolphine Tables]] (1627), incorporating many of the new discoveries.\nFile:DelftChina18thCenturyCompanieDesIndes.jpg|[[Delftware]] depicting Chinese scenes, 18th century.

These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late 19th century, followed by the [[polar exploration|exploration of the polar regions]] in the 20th century.\n\nEuropean overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the [[Old World]] (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the [[New World]] (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian exchange]], a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable diseases]] and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the [[history of cartography|mapping of the world]], resulting in a new worldview and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Explorations english.png|center|thumb|upright=3.4|Map with the main travels of the Age of Discovery.

However, he stumbled on a continent uncharted by Europeans which he thought was India. Later, it was called America, after the name of the explorer Am\u00e9rico Vesp\u00facio, and it was seen as a [[new world]]. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus \u2013 Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.<ref>Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, \"Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415\u20131580\", p. 176</ref> While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years [[Portuguese India Armadas]] also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the \"other sea\" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and later by Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]], sailing westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,<ref>Zweig, Stefan, \"Conqueror of the Seas \u2013 The Story of Magellan\", Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4067-6006-4}}</ref> while Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s'' explored the interior of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.\n\nSince 1495, the French, the English and the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of [[John Cabot]] in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778.

Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential. Further changing the mercantile situation in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] was the waning of Byzantine naval power following the death of Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] in 1180, whose dynasty had made several notable treaties and concessions with Italian traders, permitting the use of Byzantine Christian ports.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.<ref name=\"Paine_2013\"/>{{rp|316\u201338}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.<ref name=\"Paine_2013\"/>{{rp|328}}\n\n===Technology: ship design and the compass===\n{{Off topic|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Sd11-boom.JPG|thumb|A Caravel with two lateen sail rigs and a [[headsail]].

Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant [[Fern\u00e3o Gomes]] in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} each year for five years.<ref>[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 145\u201348.</ref> With his sponsorship, explorers [[Jo\u00e3o de Santar\u00e9m]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gon\u00e7alves, [[Fern\u00e3o do P\u00f3]], and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] and [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the [[Southern Cross]] as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the \"Gold Coast\" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.\n\nIn 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas, 1479. (See entry on Elmina.) This was the first colonial war among European powers.\n\nIn 1481 the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o II]] decided to build [[Elmina Castle|S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]]. In 1482 the [[Congo River]] was explored by [[Diogo C\u00e3o]],<ref>[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 335.</ref> who in 1486 continued to [[Cape Cross]] (modern [[Namibia]]).\n\nThe next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named \"Cape of Storms\" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at [[Mossel Bay]] and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the [[Great Fish River]], proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]], sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]] having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.<ref>[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 59.</ref> Soon the cape was renamed by king [[John II of Portugal]] the \"[[Cape of Good Hope]]\" (Cabo da Boa Esperan\u00e7a), because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the Indian Ocean was [[Landlocked country|land-locked]].\n\nBased on much later stories of the [[phantom island]] known as [[Bacalao]] and the carvings on [[Dighton Rock]] some have speculated that Portuguese explorer [[Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real]] discovered [[Newfoundland]] in 1473, but the sources cited are considered by mainstream historians to be unreliable and unconvincing.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lusa|title=Portugueses chegaram \u00e0 Am\u00e9rica 19 anos antes de Colombo|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/cultura/2016-02-27-Portugueses-chegaram-a-America-19-anos-antes-de-Colombo|publisher=Expresso}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish exploration: Columbus and the West Indies===\n{{see also|Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Viajes de colon en.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The four voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] 1492\u20131503]]\n\nPortugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], had begun to establish its rule over the [[Canary Islands]], located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ''[[reconquista]]'', did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Sardinia]], with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach \"the Indies\" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.<ref>[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.</ref> Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.\n\nOn the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Ni\u00f1a]]''. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the [[Sargasso Sea]].\n\nLand was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', in what he thought to be the \"[[East Indies]]\". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagar\u00edx|Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.\n[[File:TresCarabelas.jpg|thumb|left|Replicas of ''[[Ni\u00f1a]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' and ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'' at [[Palos de la Frontera]], Spain]] Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now [[Haiti]].<ref>[[#Maclean 2008|Maclean 2008]], web.</ref> Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him.

After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in [[Barcelona]], where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].<ref>[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 26.</ref>\n\nColumbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries\u2014unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.\n\n===Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)===\n{{Main|Treaty of Tordesillas}}\n[[File:Spain and Portugal.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesilhas Treaty]] meridian (purple) and the later [[Maluku Islands]] [[180th meridian|antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]]]]\n\nShortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the \"West Indies\", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.<ref>[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 345.</ref> On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] received a [[Papal bull|bull]] (''[[Inter caetera]]'') from [[Pope Alexander VI]] stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.\n\nKing [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land\u2014preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.<ref>[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107\u201311.</ref>\n\nAn agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.\n\n[[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this is not considered credible by mainstream historians.\n\nLater the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.\n\n===A New World: The Americas===\n[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseem\u00fcller map]] showing the name \"America\" for the first time.]]\nVery little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.\n\n====North America====\nThat year [[John Cabot]], also a commissioned Italian, got [[letters patent]] from King [[Henry VII of England]]. Sailing from [[Bristol]], probably backed by the local [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the \"West Indies\" would be shorter<ref>[[#Croxton 2007|Croxton 2007]], web (on subscription)</ref> and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].\nIn 1499 [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with [[P\u00earo de Barcelos]] they first sighted [[Labrador]], which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.<ref>[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 463\u201364.</ref> Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of [[Greenland]] and also Newfoundland.<ref>[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 464\u201365.</ref> Both explorations are noted in the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].\n\n====The \"True Indies\" and Brazil====\nIn 1497, newly crowned King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the \"true indies\", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.<ref>[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.</ref>\n\nThe third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]] on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.\n\nAs shipping between [[Seville]] and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew.\nOne of these Spanish fleets, that of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1499\u20131500, reached land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in July 1499,<ref name=Pohl1966>{{cite book\n  | last = Pohl\n  | first = Frederick J.\n  | title = Amerigo Vespucci: Pilot Major\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/amerigovespuccip0000pohl\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = Octagon Books\n  | year = 1966\n  | location = New York\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/amerigovespuccip0000pohl/page/54 54\u201355] }}</ref><ref>[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4820349-amerigo-and-the-new-world] Arciniegas, German (1978) ''Amerigo and the New World: The Life & Times of Amerigo Vespucci'': Octagon Press</ref> and reaching 6\u00b0S, in present-day north east [[Brazil]], before turning around.\n\nIn the beginning of 1500 [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinzon]] was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of [[Pernambuco]].

The 1515\u201316 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Sol\u00eds and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.\n\nIn April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large \"[[volta do mar]]\" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).<ref>N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492\u20131700.'' p. 75.</ref> Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the \"volta do mar\", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494\u2014so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.<ref>[[#Crow 1992|Crow 1992]], p. 136.</ref> From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India.

Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following \"a long, unbending coastline\" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32\u00b0 S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50\u00b0/52\u00b0 S (if it was by his own decision or by D.

On September 6, the expedition was reinforced with 1,000 men, fought several battles, entered a dense jungle and climbed the mountain range along the [[Chucunaque River]] from where this \"other sea\" could be seen. Balboa went ahead and, before noon September 25, he saw in the horizon an undiscovered sea, becoming the first European to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. The expedition descended towards the shore for a short reconnaissance trip, thus becoming the first Europeans to navigate the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the New World. After travelling more than {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, Balboa named the bay where they ended up [[Bay of San Miguel|''San Miguel'']]. He named the new sea [[Pacific Ocean|''Mar del Sur'' (South Sea)]], since they had travelled south to reach it. Balboa's main purpose in the expedition was the search for gold-rich kingdoms. To this end, he crossed through the lands of ''caciques'' to the islands, naming the largest one ''Isla Rica'' (Rich Island, today known as [[Isla del Rey (Panama)|Isla del Rey]]). He named the entire group ''[[Pearl Islands|Archipi\u00e9lago de las Perlas]]'', which they still keep today.\n\n===Subsequent developments to the east===\nIn 1515\u20131516, the Spanish fleet led by [[Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds]] sailed down the east coast of South America as far as [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], which Sol\u00eds named shortly before he died, while trying to find a passage to the \"South Sea\".\n\n===First circumnavigation===\n{{main|Magellan\u2013Elcano circumnavigation}}\n[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|Route of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano|Elcano]] world circumnavigation (1519\u20131522)]]\n\nBy 1516 several Portuguese navigators, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, had gathered in [[Seville]] to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]].

Ferdinand Magellan\u2014who had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the [[Maluku Islands]] were reached, kept contact with [[Francisco Serr\u00e3o]] living there<ref>[[#Zweig 1938|Zweig 1938]], p. 51.</ref><ref>[[#Donkin 2003|Donkin 2003]], p. 29.</ref>\u2014developed the theory that the islands were in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] Spanish area, supported on studies by Faleiro brothers.\n\nAware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan's expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships\u2014the [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan's command, ''San Antonio'', ''Concepcion'', ''Santiago'' and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the first being a [[caravel]], and all others rated as [[carrack]]s or \"naus\"\u2014with a crew of about 237 men from several nations, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain's economic and political sphere.<ref>[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 349.</ref>\n[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|left|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the single ship to have completed the first world [[circumnavigation]].

On October 21, starting in [[Cape Virgenes]], they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600&nbsp;km) long strait that Magellan named ''Estrecho de Todos los Santos'', the modern [[Strait of Magellan]]. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean\u2014then named ''Mar Pac\u00edfico'' because of its apparent stillness.<ref>[[#Catholic Encyclop\u00e6dia 2007|Catholic Encyclop\u00e6dia 2007]], web.</ref> The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], leaving the Spaniard [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] the task of completing the voyage, reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1521. On September 6, 1522 ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, thus completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.\n\nThis round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]].

From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.<ref>[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.</ref>\n\nBetween 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named \"Islands de Sequeira\".<ref>[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168</ref> In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea.

On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]] in 1565.<ref>[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.</ref>\n\n==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519\u20131532)==\nRumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the \"[[conquistadors]]\", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.<ref>[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web</ref>\n\nIn the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.\n\nIn 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.<ref>[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84\u201388.</ref> With three ships and about 200 men, L\u00e9on set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513.

They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Vel\u00e1zquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Vel\u00e1zquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.\n\nIn February 1519 Cort\u00e9s went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny.

They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula '''(Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.\n[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cort\u00e9s' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]\nArriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cort\u00e9s enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.<ref name=\"Grunberg 2007\"/> The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts.

Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pir\u00fa. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about \"Pir\u00fa\" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], caught the attention of Pizarro.\n\n[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the \"''Empresa del Levante''\": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.\n\nOn 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.\n\nPizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''\"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian.\"'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.\n\nThey decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called \"little camels\". The natives named the Spanish \"Children of the Sun\" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.\n\nIn the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulaci\u00f3n de Toledo''<ref>[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.</ref> authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hern\u00e1ndo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].\n\nPizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Hu\u00e1scar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would \"be no man's tributary.\" There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.\n\nIn 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: \"''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''\" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.\n\n==New trade routes (1542\u20131565)==\n[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]\n\nIn 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.<ref>[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88</ref>\n\nThe Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.<ref>N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492\u20131700.'' p. 316.</ref> After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.\n[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]] attributed to [[Kan\u014d Naizen]], 1570\u20131616 Japan]]\n\nHe reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of L\u00f3pez de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.\n\nThus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.\n\n==Northern European involvement (1595 \u2013 17th century)==\n[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the \"first modern atlas\". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]\n\nNations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.\n\nIn 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.\n\nPhilip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.<ref>[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.</ref> Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.\n\nThe emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''\"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten\"'' (''\"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East\"'').<ref>[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book</ref> This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.\n\nDutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.<ref>[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.</ref>\n\n===Exploring North America===\n[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609\u20131611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]\n\nThe 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.</ref> These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520\u20131521 the Portuguese [[Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]<ref>Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004</ref>), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.<ref>''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&redir_esc=y]</ref>\n\nIn 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban G\u00f3mez|Estev\u00e3o Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named \"The Country of Canadas]]\", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.<ref>[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.</ref><ref>[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.</ref>\n\n[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]\n\nEuropeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California]] was a peninsula.<ref>[[#Gutierrez 1998|Gutierrez 1998]]. pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Despite his discoveries, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an [[Island of California|island]]. His account provided the first recorded use of the name \"California\". [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo|Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues Cabrilho]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542 on the shores of [[San Diego Bay]] and claiming California for Spain.<ref>[[#San Diego HS|San Diego HS]], web.</ref> He also landed on [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], and continued as far as [[Point Reyes]]. After his death the crew continued exploring as far north as [[Oregon]].\n\nThe English naval commander [[Francis Drake]] sailed along the coast in 1579 north of Cabrillo's landing site while circumnavigating the world.  On 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at South Cove,Cape Arago, just south of [[Coos Bay]], [[Oregon]], and then sailed south while searching for a suitable harbour to repair his ailing ship. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Von der Porten| first1 = Edward | last2 = Aker| first2 = Raymond | last3 = Allen| first3 = Robert W. | last4 = Spitze| first4 = James | title = Who Made Drake's Plate of Brass?

He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].\n\n===Search for a northern route===\n[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]\n\nFrance, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.\n\nIn 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.<ref>[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],</ref> The vessels were separated by \"terrible whirlwinds\" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].\n\n====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====\n5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].<ref>[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258</ref> At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.\n\nThe following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.<ref>[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web</ref> The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] \"wild men\" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.\n\n[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]\n\nThe ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.\n\nIn 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).\n\n===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===\n[[File:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|The route of [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 and 1644 voyages in [[New Holland (Australia)]] in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]])]]\n\n''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, \"the unknown land of the south\") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767<ref>[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.</ref> argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.\n\n[[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.<ref>[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136\u2013246.</ref> [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres|Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]].

He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].\n[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]\n[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning \"Little Dove\"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].<ref>[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.</ref> Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in \"the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands.\" On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.\n\nIn 1642\u20131644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].\n\n==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581\u20131660)==\n{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}\n[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]\nIn the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.\n\n===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===\nAround 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.\n[[File:Yermak Timofeyevich and his band of adventurers crossing the Ural Mountains at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yermak Timofeyevich]] and his band of adventurers crossing the [[Ural Mountains]] at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe]]\n\n===Siberian river routes===\nIn the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by [[Cossacks]] hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While Cossacks came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].\n\nBetween 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy River|Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.\n\nIn 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.<ref>[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62</ref>\n\nYakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.<ref>[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]\nIn 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.<ref>[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247</ref>\n\n===Russians reach the Pacific===\nIn 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.\n\nIn 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.\n\n[[File:Krsk koch.JPG|upright=0.7|thumb|left|A 17th-century [[Koch (boat)|koch]] in a museum in [[Krasnoyarsk]]. Kochi were the earliest [[icebreaker]]s and were widely used by Russians in the [[Arctic]] and on [[Siberia]]n rivers.]]\nIn 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.<ref>[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30</ref> Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].\n\nIn 1649\u201350 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650\u201353. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.<ref>[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web</ref> Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).\n\nIn 1659\u201365 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.\n\nSo, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733\u20131743.\n\n{{further|Major explorations after the Age of Discovery}}\n\n==Global impact==\n{{Main|Columbian Exchange|History of colonialism|Globalization}}\n\n[[File:New World Domesticated plants.JPG|thumb|New World crops.

It started the [[global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries]] and led to direct European involvement the [[Chinese export porcelain|Chinese porcelain trade]]. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.\n\nThe new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older \"pagan\" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.\n[[File:Namban-08.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Portuguese ''[[wikt:\u5357\u86ee\u4eba|Nanbanjin]]'' arriving at Japan much to the surprise of locals, detail from a [[Nanban trade|Nanban]] panel of the [[Kan\u014d school]], 1593\u20131600]]\nSimilarly, in coastal Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European [[History of slavery|slave traders]], changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of [[African slave trade|African slavery]], causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland.

During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.\n\n[[File:Jesuites en chine.jpg|thumb|[[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit]] scholars collaborated extensively with Chinese astronomers, introducing [[Copernican principle]]s.

After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.<ref>[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19\u201320.</ref> However, by 1573\u2014after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila\u2014the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.<ref>[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.</ref> Although China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade during the [[global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries|16th to 18th centuries]], Japan's huge contribution of silver exports to China were critical to the world economy and China's liquidity and success with the commodity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis Owen|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391\u2013427|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|issn=1527-8050}}</ref>\n\nItalian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552\u20131610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City.

The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.\n\nThe European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became \"the centre of the ''entire'' international economy\",<ref>[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&nbsp;143.</ref> and the richest city in Europe at this time.<ref>[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.</ref> Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], \"[[Dutch Golden Age]]\" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.\n\nDespite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.<ref>[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.</ref> The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.<ref>[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410\u201311.</ref>\n\nFrom China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly-used synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.<ref>For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.</ref> Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.<ref>[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.</ref><ref>[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.</ref> The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]\u2014where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable<ref>[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.</ref>\u2014and ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.\n\n[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559\u20131636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were \"rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it\".<ref>[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205\u2013206.</ref> After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings.

Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.<ref name=\"Ebrey 2006, p. 211\"/>\n\nThe increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.<ref>[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43\u201344</ref> In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potos\u00ed]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. \"I learnt a proverb here\", said a French traveller in 1603: \"Everything is dear in Spain except silver\".<ref>[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.</ref> The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.<ref>[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.</ref> The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.<ref>[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523\u201325</ref> Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596.
