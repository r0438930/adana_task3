Eastings are on the top/bottom. Northings are on the right/left.]]\n'''Irish Transverse Mercator''' ('''ITM''') is the [[geographic coordinate system]] for Ireland. It was implemented jointly by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] (OSi) and the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] (OSNI) in 2001. The name is derived from the [[Transverse Mercator]] projection it uses and the fact that it is optimised for the island of Ireland.\n\n==History==\nThe older [[Irish grid reference system]] required GPS measurements to be \"translated\" (using [[Coordinate system#Transformations|co-ordinate transformations]]). The more precise the GPS measurements were, the more the translation process introduced inaccuracies.\n\nWhile the existing [[Universal Transverse Mercator|UTM]] co-ordinate system partly fulfilled the requirement for direct GPS compatibility it had some drawbacks, including varying levels of distortion across the island due to the central meridian being at the west coast of Ireland.\n\nThe new system needed to satisfy various criteria: GPS compatibility, map distortion for the whole island of Ireland had to be minimal, it was to be [[Map projection#Conformal|conformal]] and backward compatible with existing mapping. A customised Transverse Mercator projection was chosen.\n\nITM and the older more established Irish Grid will (initially at least) be used in parallel. As a result ITM coordinates had to be obviously different so users would not confuse the two. This was done by shifting the ITM false origin further into the Atlantic and thereby creating substantially different co-ordinate numbers for any given location.\n\nWhile OSi and OSNI intend to supply map information in the older Irish Grid format into the future, the Irish Institution of Surveyors has recommended that ITM be adopted as soon as possible as the preferred official co-ordinate system for Ireland.\n\n==Examples==\n\nAn ITM co-ordinate is generally given as a pair of two six-digit numbers (excluding any digits behind a [[decimal point]] which may be used in very precise surveying). The first number is always the [[easting]] and the second is the [[northing]]. The easting and northing are in metres from the false [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].\n\nThe ITM co-ordinate for the [[Spire of Dublin]] on [[O'Connell Street]] is:\n\n:715830, 734697\n\nThe first figure is the easting and means that the location is 715,830 metres east from the false origin (along the [[X axis]]). The second figure is the northing and puts the location 734,697 metres north of the false origin (along the [[Y axis]])\n\nThe equivalent Irish Grid co-ordinate for the same location is:\n\n:315904, 234671\n\nThe Spire of Dublin example provides a [[Position fixing|fix]] for a location that is accurate to 1 metre. With ITM it is possible to give a more accurate co-ordinate for a given location by using a decimal point after the initial six figure easting and northing.\n\nThe ITM co-ordinate for the passive GPS station at the OSi office is:\n\n:E 709885.081m, N 736167.699m\n\nThis ITM co-ordinate has three digits behind the decimal point which gives a fix for a location with millimetre accuracy. Also notice how the easting in this example is indicated with an \u201cE\u201d and likewise an \u201cN\u201d for the northing. The fact that the co-ordinate is in metres is indicated by the lowercase m.\n\nWith ITM there is no provision for using [[Myriad (unit of area)|myriad]] letters and truncated coordinates as there is with the Irish Grid.\nEvery co-ordinate must be given with at least a six-digit easting and northing from the false origin.\n\n==Comparison of ITM, Irish Grid and UTM==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!
