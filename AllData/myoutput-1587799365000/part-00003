Crime rates in Oregon decreased between 1994 and 2000, but increased in 2001; opponents of Measure 11 noted that the trend mirrored national trends, while acknowledging that some likely re-offenders were imprisoned as a result of the law.<ref name=M11brief/>\n\nThe effectiveness of Measure 11 to deter crime is further questioned when compared to research about mandatory minimums. Research has repeatedly disproven mandatory minimums as public safety tools. For example, a 1993 meta-analysis report compiled from 50 different studies found mandatory minimums\u2019 lengthier prison sentences produced higher rates of recidivism and a tendency for lower-risk offenders to experience more negative outcomes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://ojrc.info/youth-and-measure-11-in-oregon/|title=Youth and Measure 11 in Oregon|website=Oregon Justice Resource Center|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref>\n\n== Background and context ==\nPrior to 1989, Oregon judges would decide whether a convicted felon should be put on probation or sent to prison, and for those sent to prison, set a maximum sentence (known as an \"indeterminate sentence.\")<ref name=bbrief>Taylor, Bill.

The Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision continues to have release authority over those prison inmates sentenced for crimes committed prior to November 1, 1989, those sentenced by the courts as dangerous offenders, and for murderers and aggravated murderers who are eligible for parole, regardless of the date of their crimes.

In fact, Oregon has the second highest rate of youth transfers to adult court in the nation, with young people - especially youth of color - subjected to lifelong consequences as a result.\n* In 2012, Oregon convicted black youth of Measure 11 offenses at 17 times the rate of their white counterparts.\n* Black youth account for 15.5% of Measure 11 indictments but only 1.8% of the general population in Oregon (resulting in an overrepresentation of around 8.6 times.)\n* The average relative rate of disparity (measure by the relative rate index or RRI2 ) between black and white youth for the five most common Measure 11 crimes is 15.26. The overall RRI for all crimes covered in this study was 13.6.\n* Oregon taxpayers bear a significant burden for youth incarceration. Measure 11 offenders require close custody, the most expensive form of state confinement, which can result in costs of as much as $263 per day and $95,995 per year, per juvenile.\n\n== Impact on Women ==\nIn October of 2018, the annual [https://ojrc.info/women-in-prison-conference Women in Prison Conference] held by the Oregon Justice Resource Center Women's Justice Project focused primarily on the effects of mandatory minimum sentences imposed by Measure 11 on female defendants.<ref name=\":02\">\"Women in Prison Conference 2018: Women and Measure 11\" ''Oregon Justice Resource Center.[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/524b5617e4b0b106ced5f067/t/5c787f2ac83025af89e48f8d/1551400758946/WIPC+18+Report+FINAL.pdf]''</ref> The conference highlights similar concerns and statistics echoed by Measure 11's original opponents in concerns to youth,<ref>\"Measure 11 Arguments\"[http://www.crimevictimsunited.org/measure11/measure11arguments.htm] Crime Victims United.

Crime rates in Oregon decreased between 1994 and 2000, but increased in 2001; opponents of Measure 11 noted that the trend mirrored national trends, while acknowledging that some likely re-offenders were imprisoned as a result of the law.<ref name=M11brief/>\n\nThe effectiveness of Measure 11 to deter crime is further questioned when compared to research about mandatory minimums.

The Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision continues to have release authority over those prison inmates sentenced for crimes committed prior to November 1, 1989, those sentenced by the courts as dangerous offenders, and for murderers and aggravated murderers who are eligible for parole, regardless of the date of their crimes.

In fact, Oregon has the second highest rate of youth transfers to adult court in the nation, with young people - especially youth of color - subjected to lifelong consequences as a result.\n* In 2012, Oregon convicted black youth of Measure 11 offenses at 17 times the rate of their white counterparts.\n* Black youth account for 15.5% of Measure 11 indictments but only 1.8% of the general population in Oregon (resulting in an overrepresentation of around 8.6 times.)\n* The average relative rate of disparity (measure by the relative rate index or RRI2 ) between black and white youth for the five most common Measure 11 crimes is 15.26. The overall RRI for all crimes covered in this study was 13.6.\n* Oregon taxpayers bear a significant burden for youth incarceration. Measure 11 offenders require close custody, the most expensive form of state confinement, which can result in costs of as much as $263 per day and $95,995 per year, per juvenile.\n\n== Impact on Women ==\nIn October of 2018, the annual [https://ojrc.info/women-in-prison-conference Women in Prison Conference] held by the Oregon Justice Resource Center Women's Justice Project focused primarily on the effects of mandatory minimum sentences imposed by Measure 11 on female defendants.<ref name=\":02\">\"Women in Prison Conference 2018: Women and Measure 11\" ''Oregon Justice Resource Center.[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/524b5617e4b0b106ced5f067/t/5c787f2ac83025af89e48f8d/1551400758946/WIPC+18+Report+FINAL.pdf]''</ref> The conference highlights similar concerns and statistics echoed by Measure 11's original opponents in concerns to youth,<ref>\"Measure 11 Arguments\"[http://www.crimevictimsunited.org/measure11/measure11arguments.htm] Crime Victims United.
