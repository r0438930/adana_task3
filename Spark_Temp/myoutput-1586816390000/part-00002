They concluded by praising the track \"My Job\" for bringing Cam out of his comfort zone to deliver a serious subject matter.<ref name=\"EW\"/><ref name=\"RS\"/> Nathan Slavik of DJBooth found the album a bit lengthy with unnecessary skits and dull tracks but found Cam's lyrical content and choice in party tracks still on-point, saying that \"while ''Crime Pays'' is far from a perfect album, it is more than enough to serve as a notice to hip-hop: Cam\u2019ron\u2019s back, and he is not to be slept on.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/>\n\nJesse Cataldo of [[Slant Magazine]] was also critical of the needless skits and anonymous brag tracks that border on misogyny but found the production on the same footing with Cam's idiosyncratic wordplay, saying that \"forgetting the excess filler, he\u2019s [also] put out a pretty solid album.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Ian Cohen from ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' was mixed about the album, finding Cam's usually humorous lyrics and confident flow wasted with production that's more appropriate for a mixtape.

Despite the fact that none of the singles charted, the album proved to be successful, charting at #3 on the Billboard 200 selling an estimated 45,000 copies its first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missinfo.tv |title=MissInfo.tv |publisher=MissInfo.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 68/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/crime-pays/camron |title=Reviews for Crime Pays by Cam'ron |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=David |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/crime-pays-mw0000816238 |title=Crime Pays - Cam'ron |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n|rev2 = DJBooth\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"DJB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/camron-crime-pays-05120901/ |title=Cam\u2019ron - Crime Pays |last=Slavik |first=Nathan |website=DJBooth |publisher=The DJBooth, LLC. |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233215/http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/camron-crime-pays-05120901/ |archive-date=May 25, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev3Score = B<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite magazine|last=Vozick-Levinson |first=Simon |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20276736,00.html |title=Crime Pays Review |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=May 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5|full=Red N.png|empty=Blank N.PNG|rating=N}}<ref name=\"Now\">{{cite news|url=https://nowtoronto.com/music/album-reviews/camron-2009-05-20/ |title=Cam'ron - Crime Pays (Asylum/Diplomatic Man) |last=Rennie |first=Andrew |newspaper=[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]] |publisher=[[Now Communications|NOW Communications]] |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5Score = 5.7/10<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13029-crime-pays/ |title=Cam'ron: Crime Pays |last=Cohen |first=Ian |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[PopMatters]]''\n|rev6Score = {{Rating|4|10}}<ref name=\"PM\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/94364-camron-crime-pays/ |title=Cam'ron: Crime Pays |last=Sargent |first=Jordan |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''RapReviews''\n|rev7Score = 6.5/10<ref name=\"RR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2009_05_crimepays.html |title=Cam'Ron :: Crime Pays :: Asylum Records |last=Hernandez |first=Pedro |website=RapReviews |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev8Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28001581/review/28123956/crime_pays |title=Crime Pays : Cam'ron : Review |last=Rosen |first=Jody |authorlink=Jody Rosen |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517202631/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28001581/review/28123956/crime_pays |archivedate=May 17, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|rev9 = [[Slant Magazine]]\n|rev9Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Slant\">{{cite magazine|last=Cataldo |first=Jesse |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/camron-crime-pays |title=Cam'ron Crime Pays |magazine=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref>\n|rev10 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev10Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite magazine|last=Ryan |first=Chris |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/camron-crime-pays-asylum |title=Cam'ron 'Crime Pays' (Asylum) |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |publisher=[[Spin Media]] |date=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n''Crime Pays'' received positive reviews but [[Music journalism|music critic]]s found criticism in its length, production and lyrical content. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 68, based on 13 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\n[[AllMusic]] editor David Jeffries praised Cam for re-tooling his production and lyrical content to bring back the grit and humor he lost in ''[[Killa Season]]'', concluding with, \"Add it all up and ''Crime Pays'' is just what the fans want, without any sense the man is pandering.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Chris Ryan of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' also praised Cam for delivering material that was reminiscent of his better efforts, concluding that \"He may have kept his lyrical gift hidden, but he didn\u2019t lose it.\"<ref name=\"Spin\"/> Andrew Rennie of ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' praised the album for containing less featured artists to focus on tight wordplay and sprinklings of topical tracks like \"My Job\" and \"Silky\", concluding that, \"Cam'ron has evolved on this no-frills release, and it is disarmingly effective.\"<ref name=\"Now\"/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Simon Vozick-Levinson and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Jody Rosen]] both similarly praised the album for showcasing Cam's knack for lacing typical street tracks with a unique flow and strong wordplay. They concluded by praising the track \"My Job\" for bringing Cam out of his comfort zone to deliver a serious subject matter.<ref name=\"EW\"/><ref name=\"RS\"/> Nathan Slavik of DJBooth found the album a bit lengthy with unnecessary skits and dull tracks but found Cam's lyrical content and choice in party tracks still on-point, saying that \"while ''Crime Pays'' is far from a perfect album, it is more than enough to serve as a notice to hip-hop: Cam\u2019ron\u2019s back, and he is not to be slept on.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/>\n\nJesse Cataldo of [[Slant Magazine]] was also critical of the needless skits and anonymous brag tracks that border on misogyny but found the production on the same footing with Cam's idiosyncratic wordplay, saying that \"forgetting the excess filler, he\u2019s [also] put out a pretty solid album.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Ian Cohen from ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' was mixed about the album, finding Cam's usually humorous lyrics and confident flow wasted with production that's more appropriate for a mixtape. He also pointed out that Cam's material was similar to [[Kool Keith]] based on the skits, concluding that \"In their minds, Cam's done nothing worth really mentioning since 2005, and ''Crime Pays'' often makes you wonder if they've got a point.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Jordan Sargent of ''[[PopMatters]]'' criticized the album for lacking the retro-soul beats of ''[[Purple Haze (album)|Purple Haze]]'' that had energy and instead contains lackluster synth production with lyrics that border on self-parody, saying that, \"On ''Crime Pays'' he swings too far in the opposite direction, coming back with an album that is unadventurous and uninteresting.\"<ref name=\"PM\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| title1          = Crime Pays\n| note1           = Intro\n| extra1          = [[Skitzo]]\n| length1         = 2:32\n| title2          = Cook'n up\n| extra2          = [[I.N.F.O.
