Their migration took place from the settlement of Jamestown through the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642\u20131660). Some royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II reputedly called Virginia his \"Old Dominion\" \u2013 a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early supposedly aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term \"distressed Cavaliers\", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Some Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. FFVs often refer to Virginia as \"Cavalier Country\". These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but most who had settled in Virginia stayed in Virginia.\n\nMany such early settlers in Virginia were so-called \"Second Sons\". [[Primogeniture]] favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Second or third sons went out to the colonies to make their fortune, or entered the military and the clergy. Tidewater Virginia evolved as a society descended from second or third sons of English gentry who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of what became the southern elite in America.\n\nIn some cases, longstanding ties among families of the English gentry were carried to the new colony, where they were reinforced by marriage and other relations. For instance, there were ancestral ties between the [[Nicholas Spencer|Spencer]] family of Bedfordshire and the [[Washington (name)|Washington]] family; a Spencer secured the land grant later purchased by the Washingtons, where they built their [[Mount Vernon]] home. These sorts of ties were common in the early colony, as families shuttled back and forth between England and Virginia, maintaining their connections with the mother country and with each other.\n\nA thin network of increasingly interrelated families made up the planter elite and held power in colonial Virginia. \"As early as 1660 every seat on the ruling Council of Virginia was held by members of five interrelated families,\" writes British historian [[John Keegan]], \"and as late as 1775 every council member was descended from one of the 1660 councillors.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Civil War |page=[https://archive.org/details/americancivilwar00keeg/page/334 334] |first=John |last=Keegan |authorlink=John Keegan |publisher=Alfred A.

Rolfe had become prominent and wealthy as the first to successfully develop an export [[cash crop]] for the Colony with new varieties of tobacco. Their only child, [[Thomas Rolfe]], was born on January 30, 1615. He married and had a family: his descendants married into other elite families.\n\nPocahontas was much celebrated in London where she was welcomed with great ceremony at the Royal Court. She died young but became legendary as the first Indian from Virginia to become Christian, marry an Englishman, and have a known child from such a marriage. (There were no doubt mixed-race children born to lower-class colonists and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] women, although they may have been neither married nor Christian.) She became an important symbol of friendly Native American-English relations of the Jamestown colony. By virtue of many fictional accounts, her marriage was romanticized and became part of the mythology of early American history.<ref>[[Camilla Townsend]], ''Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma'' (2007)</ref><ref>F.

A mother's maiden name might be used as a \"[[middle name]]\", to document that part of the person's ancestry. For example, Lt. Col.

According to [[Mattaponi]] and [[Patawomeck]] tradition, Pocahontas was previously married to a Patawomeck ''[[weroance]]'', Kocoum, who was murdered by Englishmen when [[Samuel Argall]] abducted her on April 13, 1613.<ref name=\"tides\">{{cite journal |last=Deyo |first=William \"Night Owl\" |date=5 September 2009 |title=Our Patawomeck Ancestors |url=http://patawomeckindians.org/Patawomeck%20Tides%202009.pdf |journal=Patawomeck Tides |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2\u20137 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145119/http://patawomeckindians.org/Patawomeck%20Tides%202009.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Educated among the English of Virginia and converted to Christianity during her captivity in [[Henricus]], Pocahontas married colonist [[John Rolfe]] at a church in Jamestown on April 5, 1614. Rolfe had become prominent and wealthy as the first to successfully develop an export [[cash crop]] for the Colony with new varieties of tobacco. Their only child, [[Thomas Rolfe]], was born on January 30, 1615. He married and had a family: his descendants married into other elite families.\n\nPocahontas was much celebrated in London where she was welcomed with great ceremony at the Royal Court. She died young but became legendary as the first Indian from Virginia to become Christian, marry an Englishman, and have a known child from such a marriage. (There were no doubt mixed-race children born to lower-class colonists and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] women, although they may have been neither married nor Christian.) She became an important symbol of friendly Native American-English relations of the Jamestown colony. By virtue of many fictional accounts, her marriage was romanticized and became part of the mythology of early American history.<ref>[[Camilla Townsend]], ''Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma'' (2007)</ref><ref>F.

W. Randolph & English, 1887</ref> Excluded from this history were 'natural children', [[mixed-race]] descendants of unions with slaves.\n\nFamilies often used surnames as given names, as in the \"Johns\" of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. A mother's maiden name might be used as a \"[[middle name]]\", to document that part of the person's ancestry. For example, Lt. Col. Powhatan Bolling Whittle of the [[38th Virginia Infantry]], [[Confederate States Army]] was an uncle of Matoaka Whittle Sims.<ref>[http://www.victorianvilla.com/sims-mitchell/history/whittle_pb/index.htm Lt.
