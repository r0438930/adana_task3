The game is based on a series of [[Road racing|road races]] throughout the [[United States]] that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. It is the second installment in the ''[[Road Rash]]'' series, and introduces a split-screen two-player mode for competing human players, [[nitrous oxide]] charges on certain bikes, and [[chain]]s as offensive weapons.\n\nThe development of ''Road Rash II'' was initiated before the end of the 1991 Christmas season, and the game was released within its deadline of the following season. ''Road Rash II'' was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers appreciating the visuals and addition of the multiplayer mode while pointing out the lack of innovation in the fundamental gameplay. A conversion for the [[Game Boy Color]] was developed by [[3d6 Games]] and released under the title ''Road Rash'' in 2000. The game saw additional releases on the [[PlayStation Portable]] compilation title ''[[EA Replay]]'' in 2006 and on the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] in 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Road_Rash_II_Split_Screen.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An example of two-player gameplay in the Genesis version of ''Road Rash II''. The game's larger cartridge size compared to its predecessor allowed the feature to be introduced in this installment of the series.]]\n''Road Rash II'' puts the player in control of a [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racer]] who must finish in third-place or higher in a series of five road races to advance through the game's five [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].<ref name=\"GenManual3\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3</ref> The game's races take place in a number of locales across the [[United States]], including [[Hawaii]], [[Arizona]], [[Tennessee]], [[Alaska]], and [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"GenManual1718\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 17\u201318</ref> During a race, the player can brake, accelerate, and attack neighboring racers. The player character will punch at the nearest racer with a default input, while holding a directional button during the input will result in either a backhand or a kick. Some opponents wield weapons such as [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[chain]]s, which can be taken and used by the player if the enemy racer is attacked as they are holding the weapon out to strike.<ref name=\"GenManual2\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 2</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1014\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 10\u201314</ref> The player racer can be ejected from their bike if they crash into an obstacle (such as boulders, cars, [[deer]] and [[Cattle|cows]]<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>) or if they run out of [[Health (gaming)|stamina]] (shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen) due to fights with other racers. In this event, the racer will automatically run back toward their bike, though the player can alter their course and avoid incoming traffic with the directional buttons, or stand still by holding the brake input button. Opponents will likewise be ejected from their bike if their own stamina is depleted. The stamina of the nearest racer is visible within the bottom-right corner of the screen, and the color of both stamina meters change from green to red as they deplete.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\nThe player character begins the game with $1,000.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> When the player wins a race, a cash prize is added to the player's balance.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> From the main menu, the player can access a bike shop to view bikes for sale and potentially purchase a new bike with the money they have accumulated.<ref name=\"GenManual49\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1517\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Certain bikes are equipped with a series of [[nitrous oxide]] charges, which can provide a burst of speed if the player quickly taps the acceleration input button twice.<ref name=\"GenManual2\"/><ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> The player will receive a password at the end of a successful race, which can be entered at a password entry screen in a subsequent session to maintain the player's progress.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> When the player wins a race on all five of the game's tracks, they will advance to the next level. With each subsequent level, the cash prizes become higher, the courses become longer, and the opponent racers become more aggressive. The player wins the game if they win a race on each track in all five levels.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>\n\nThe player's bike has its own \"condition meter\" between the player's and opponents' stamina meters, which decreases every time the player suffers a crash. If the meter fully depletes, the bike will be wrecked, the player's participation in the current race will end, and a repair bill must be paid. Motorcycle cops also make sporadic appearances throughout the game's tracks. If the player crashes within the vicinity of a cop, the cop will end their participation in the current race by apprehending them and charging them a fine.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> With each subsequent level, repair bills and fines become more expensive, and cops appear more frequently.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> If the player lacks the funds to cover either a repair bill or a fine, the game will [[Game over|end prematurely]].<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\n''Road Rash II'' features a two-player mode that can either be [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|played intermittently between players]] or simultaneously with the use of a split-screen display. Two players can either race against each other along with other computer-controlled racers or engage in the \"Mano a Mano\" mode, in which the two human players are the only competing racers on the track. In this mode, the players can select a weapon to wield prior to the start of the race, and no money is won or lost, though cops still appear as an obstacle and can end the race if they apprehend one of the players.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> The Game Boy Color version also features a two-player mode via use of the [[Game Link Cable]].<ref name=\"EGMGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/21/EGM_US_135.pdf |title=Preview Gallery: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=October 2000 |page=122}}</ref><ref name=\"GameProGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |title=ProNews: Boy Scout \u2013 What's New in Handheld |magazine=[[GamePro]] |date=October 2000 |page=38 |access-date=2019-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512161054/https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |archive-date=2019-05-12 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Development and release==\nBefore the conclusion of the 1991 Christmas season, EA made the decision to create a sequel to ''Road Rash'', and set a deadline for the following Christmas. Although the development team considered the deadline tight given the length of the previous game's development, the established framework given by the preceding title allowed the team to focus on enhancing the gameplay and visuals for the sequel.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\">{{cite magazine |title=The Making of: The ''Road Rash'' Trilogy |last=Wallace |first=Mitch |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=166 |date=April 2017 |pages=20\u201327}}</ref> The total development team of ''Road Rash II'' consisted of three programmers, five graphic artists, and four track builders.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Behind the Screens: The Making of ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |pages=126\u2013127 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Returning crew members from the previous game include producer and designer Randy Breen, designer and programmer Dan Geisler, programmer Walt Stein, and artists Arthur Koch and Peggy Brennan.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, inner cover</ref> Carl Mey, the technical director of the original ''Road Rash'', was promoted to Director of Technology at EA following the first game's development, and thus had limited involvement with the sequel.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\">{{cite magazine |title=Behind the Scenes: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[GamesTM]] |issue=99 |date=August 2010 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |pages=138\u2013139}}</ref> Mey's game director position was inherited by Kevin McGrath,<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> and Mey would leave EA to work for [[Sega]] before the conclusion of ''Road Rash II'''s development.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\"/>\n\nBreen expanded the sequel's setting to explore the United States outside of the Californian locales of the previous game. Breen explained that \"I was trying to maintain a certain progression through the fantasy of the product, which was that the first ''Road Rash'' was a roots-oriented thing. It happened locally, and people would run these races surreptitiously and do them in back roads where nobody knew about them \u2013 kind of a ''[[Fight Club]]'' thing. And they gradually expanded outward.\" For the game's locations, some of the artists incorporated photos by reducing their colors, while others used the photos as reference and drew the locations from scratch. ''Road Rash II'' introduced the chain as an offensive weapon. To create reference material for the body mechanics of swinging a chain, Koch filmed himself performing the action.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> The expansion to an 8-megabit format from the original game's 5-megabits allowed the team to implement a split-screen two-player mode that they were unable to incorporate into the preceding title.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The two-player split screen took Geisler approximately three months to create. ''Road Rash II'' includes [[cutscene]]s that play at the end of a race, which were conceptualized as a reward based on the player's performance. The cutscenes were roughly [[storyboard]]ed and created by Koch in low resolution to fit within the console's memory. The characters in the cutscenes were ten pixels tall and informally referred to by the development team as \"little dudes\".<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/>\n\nThe artificial intelligence of the opponent racers was improved to be less predictable and more individualistic; certain racers would be more focused on the road than on the human racer, while others would be more aggressive.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The cops were also enhanced with the ability to take damage and fight back against the player, after previously being immune to player attacks and restricted to bumping against racers in the first game; Koch claimed that \"''Road Rash II'' was the first game in which you could beat, and get beaten, by a cop.\" Controversy surrounded this feature due to the recent [[Police brutality|beating]] of [[Rodney King]], which made the development team uncertain on its incorporation.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> Some potential new features that were omitted due to hardware limitations include weather conditions and a [[Harley-Davidson]]-style bike.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The game's audio was created by [[Rob Hubbard]], Don Veca and Tony Berkeley. The game's character banter and instruction booklet were written by Jamie Poolos.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> The yellow [[Yamaha FZR1000]] featured on the cover was Breen's own bike, and would later be featured in the full-motion videos of the 32-bit versions of ''Road Rash''.<ref name=\"RetroGamer88\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |title=Grazing Saddles: The Complete History of ''Road Rash'' |last=Hunt |first=Stuart |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=88 |date=April 2011 |page=47 |access-date=2019-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114210141/https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |archive-date=2020-01-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''Road Rash II'' was released in North America and Europe in December 1992.<ref name=\"GameFan\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/0/0c/GameFan_US_0102.pdf |title=Viewpoint: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[GameFan|Diehard GameFan]] |date=December 1992 |page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"MeanMachines\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/mean-machines-sega-magazine-02/page/n19 |title=MegaDrive Review: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mean Machines|Mean Machines Sega]] |last1=Leadbetter |first=Richard |last2=Automatic |first2=Radion |date=November 1992 |pages=20\u201323}}</ref><ref name=\"GamePro\">{{cite web |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |title=Genesis Pro Review: ''Road Rash II'' |author=Gideon |date=January 1993 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |pp=52\u201353 |access-date=2019-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171344/https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-12-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"EGMGEN\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |page=30 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Versions for the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] were announced in December 1994, but were not released.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/megazoneau46/page/n7/mode/2up |title=Game Spy: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mega Zone]] |date=December 1994 |page=9}}</ref> The Game Boy Color version was developed by [[3d6 Games]],<ref name=\"EGMGBC\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/62/EGM_US_137.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash'' (Game Boy Color) |last=Smith |first=Shawn |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=December 2000 |page=240}}</ref> with graphics created by [[Stoo Cambridge]].

The game is based on a series of [[Road racing|road races]] throughout the [[United States]] that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. It is the second installment in the ''[[Road Rash]]'' series, and introduces a split-screen two-player mode for competing human players, [[nitrous oxide]] charges on certain bikes, and [[chain]]s as offensive weapons.\n\nThe development of ''Road Rash II'' was initiated before the end of the 1991 Christmas season, and the game was released within its deadline of the following season. ''Road Rash II'' was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers appreciating the visuals and addition of the multiplayer mode while pointing out the lack of innovation in the fundamental gameplay. A conversion for the [[Game Boy Color]] was developed by [[3d6 Games]] and released under the title ''Road Rash'' in 2000. The game saw additional releases on the [[PlayStation Portable]] compilation title ''[[EA Replay]]'' in 2006 and on the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] in 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Road_Rash_II_Split_Screen.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An example of two-player gameplay in the Genesis version of ''Road Rash II''. The game's larger cartridge size compared to its predecessor allowed the feature to be introduced in this installment of the series.]]\n''Road Rash II'' puts the player in control of a [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racer]] who must finish in third-place or higher in a series of five road races to advance through the game's five [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].<ref name=\"GenManual3\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3</ref> The game's races take place in a number of locales across the [[United States]], including [[Hawaii]], [[Arizona]], [[Tennessee]], [[Alaska]], and [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"GenManual1718\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 17\u201318</ref> During a race, the player can brake, accelerate, and attack neighboring racers. The player character will punch at the nearest racer with a default input, while holding a directional button during the input will result in either a backhand or a kick. Some opponents wield weapons such as [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[chain]]s, which can be taken and used by the player if the enemy racer is attacked as they are holding the weapon out to strike.<ref name=\"GenManual2\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 2</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1014\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 10\u201314</ref> The player racer can be ejected from their bike if they crash into an obstacle (such as boulders, cars, [[deer]] and [[Cattle|cows]]<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>) or if they run out of [[Health (gaming)|stamina]] (shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen) due to fights with other racers. In this event, the racer will automatically run back toward their bike, though the player can alter their course and avoid incoming traffic with the directional buttons, or stand still by holding the brake input button. Opponents will likewise be ejected from their bike if their own stamina is depleted; the stamina of the nearest racer is visible within the bottom-right corner of the screen, and the color of both stamina meters change from green to red as they deplete.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\nThe player character begins the game with $1,000.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> When the player wins a race, a cash prize is added to the player's balance.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> From the main menu, the player can access a bike shop to view bikes for sale and potentially purchase a new bike with the money they have accumulated.<ref name=\"GenManual49\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1517\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Certain bikes are equipped with a series of [[nitrous oxide]] charges, which can provide a burst of speed if the player quickly taps the acceleration input button twice.<ref name=\"GenManual2\"/><ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> The player will receive a password at the end of a successful race, which can be entered at a password entry screen in a subsequent session to maintain the player's progress.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> When the player wins a race on all five of the game's tracks, they will advance to the next level. With each subsequent level, the cash prizes become higher, the courses become longer, and the opponent racers become more aggressive. The player wins the game if they win a race on each track in all five levels.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>\n\nThe player's bike has its own \"condition meter\" between the player's and opponents' stamina meters, which decreases every time the player suffers a crash. If the meter fully depletes, the bike will be wrecked, the player's participation in the current race will end, and a repair bill must be paid. Motorcycle cops also make sporadic appearances throughout the game's tracks. If the player crashes within the vicinity of a cop, the cop will end their participation in the current race by apprehending them and charging them a fine.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> With each subsequent level, repair bills and fines become more expensive, and cops appear more frequently.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> If the player lacks the funds to cover either a repair bill or a fine, the game will [[Game over|end prematurely]].<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\n''Road Rash II'' features a two-player mode that can either be [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|played intermittently between players]] or simultaneously with the use of a split-screen display. Two players can either race against each other along with other computer-controlled racers or engage in the \"Mano a Mano\" mode, in which the two human players are the only competing racers on the track. In this mode, the players can select a weapon to wield prior to the start of the race, and no money is won or lost, though cops still appear as an obstacle and can end the race if they apprehend one of the players.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> The Game Boy Color version also features a two-player mode via use of the [[Game Link Cable]].<ref name=\"EGMGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/21/EGM_US_135.pdf |title=Preview Gallery: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=October 2000 |page=122}}</ref><ref name=\"GameProGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |title=ProNews: Boy Scout \u2013 What's New in Handheld |magazine=[[GamePro]] |date=October 2000 |page=38 |access-date=2019-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512161054/https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |archive-date=2019-05-12 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Development and release==\nBefore the conclusion of the 1991 Christmas season, EA made the decision to create a sequel to ''Road Rash'', and set a deadline for the following Christmas. Although the development team considered the deadline tight given the length of the previous game's development, the established framework given by the preceding title allowed the team to focus on enhancing the gameplay and visuals for the sequel.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\">{{cite magazine |title=The Making of: The ''Road Rash'' Trilogy |last=Wallace |first=Mitch |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=166 |date=April 2017 |pages=20\u201327}}</ref> The total development team of ''Road Rash II'' consisted of three programmers, five graphic artists, and four track builders.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Behind the Screens: The Making of ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |pages=126\u2013127 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Returning crew members from the previous game include producer and designer Randy Breen, designer and programmer Dan Geisler, programmer Walt Stein, and artists Arthur Koch and Peggy Brennan.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, inner cover</ref> Carl Mey, the technical director of the original ''Road Rash'', was promoted to Director of Technology at EA following the first game's development, and thus had limited involvement with the sequel.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\">{{cite magazine |title=Behind the Scenes: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[GamesTM]] |issue=99 |date=August 2010 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |pages=138\u2013139}}</ref> Mey's game director position was inherited by Kevin McGrath,<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> and Mey would leave EA to work for [[Sega]] before the conclusion of ''Road Rash II'''s development.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\"/>\n\nBreen expanded the sequel's setting to explore the United States outside of the Californian locales of the previous game. Breen explained that \"I was trying to maintain a certain progression through the fantasy of the product, which was that the first ''Road Rash'' was a roots-oriented thing. It happened locally, and people would run these races surreptitiously and do them in back roads where nobody knew about them \u2013 kind of a ''[[Fight Club]]'' thing. And they gradually expanded outward.\" For the game's locations, some of the artists incorporated photos by reducing their colors, while others used the photos as reference and drew the locations from scratch. ''Road Rash II'' introduced the chain as an offensive weapon. To create reference material for the body mechanics of swinging a chain, Koch filmed himself performing the action.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> The expansion to an 8-megabit format from the original game's 5-megabits allowed the team to implement a split-screen two-player mode that they were unable to incorporate into the preceding title.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The two-player split screen took Geisler approximately three months to create. ''Road Rash II'' includes [[cutscene]]s that play at the end of a race, which were conceptualized as a reward based on the player's performance. The cutscenes were roughly [[storyboard]]ed and created by Koch in low resolution to fit within the console's memory. The characters in the cutscenes were ten pixels tall and informally referred to by the development team as \"little dudes\".<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/>\n\nThe artificial intelligence of the opponent racers was improved to be less predictable and more individualistic; certain racers would be more focused on the road than on the human racer, while others would be more aggressive.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The cops were also enhanced with the ability to take damage and fight back against the player, after previously being immune to player attacks and restricted to bumping against racers in the first game; Koch claimed that \"''Road Rash II'' was the first game in which you could beat, and get beaten, by a cop.\" Controversy surrounded this feature due to the recent [[Police brutality|beating]] of [[Rodney King]], which made the development team uncertain on its incorporation.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> Some potential new features that were omitted due to hardware limitations include weather conditions and a [[Harley-Davidson]]-style bike.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The game's audio was created by [[Rob Hubbard]], Don Veca and Tony Berkeley. The game's character banter and instruction booklet were written by Jamie Poolos.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> The yellow [[Yamaha FZR1000]] featured on the cover was Breen's own bike, and would later be featured in the full-motion videos of the 32-bit versions of ''Road Rash''.<ref name=\"RetroGamer88\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |title=Grazing Saddles: The Complete History of ''Road Rash'' |last=Hunt |first=Stuart |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=88 |date=April 2011 |page=47 |access-date=2019-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114210141/https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |archive-date=2020-01-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''Road Rash II'' was released in North America and Europe in December 1992.<ref name=\"GameFan\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/0/0c/GameFan_US_0102.pdf |title=Viewpoint: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[GameFan|Diehard GameFan]] |date=December 1992 |page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"MeanMachines\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/mean-machines-sega-magazine-02/page/n19 |title=MegaDrive Review: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mean Machines|Mean Machines Sega]] |last1=Leadbetter |first=Richard |last2=Automatic |first2=Radion |date=November 1992 |pages=20\u201323}}</ref><ref name=\"GamePro\">{{cite web |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |title=Genesis Pro Review: ''Road Rash II'' |author=Gideon |date=January 1993 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |pp=52\u201353 |access-date=2019-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171344/https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-12-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"EGMGEN\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |page=30 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Versions for the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] were announced in December 1994, but were not released.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/megazoneau46/page/n7/mode/2up |title=Game Spy: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mega Zone]] |date=December 1994 |page=9}}</ref> The Game Boy Color version was developed by [[3d6 Games]],<ref name=\"EGMGBC\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/62/EGM_US_137.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash'' (Game Boy Color) |last=Smith |first=Shawn |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=December 2000 |page=240}}</ref> with graphics created by [[Stoo Cambridge]].
