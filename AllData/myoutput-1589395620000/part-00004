It is located near the village of [[Esparron-de-Verdon]] in the French [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]] in the region [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]].\n\nIt is the last of five reservoirs established on the Verdon since 1963; of these, the lake of Esparron is the third largest by surface area after the lakes of [[Lake of Sainte-Croix|Sainte-Croix]] and [[Lac de Castillon|Castillon]]. Its creation flooded the entire plain that overlooked Esparron-de-Verdon, and raised the level of the river for 8 km upstream from the lake. This had the consequence of cutting the old road leading to Saint-Julien in the Var department and engulfing the bridge, the only human building drowned at the bottom of this lake.\n\nThe maximum depth of 55 m is measured directly above the dam.\n\nLake Esparron is an important summer tourism center, frequented for water recreation and for fishing. As on all the waters of the Verdon, the use of motor boats is prohibited, giving free rein to electric boats and sailing.\n\nThe remains of the old Verdon canal are on the shore facing the village of Esparron-de-Verdon. On the same shore, near the St Julien Beach, is the first of two imposing water intakes that help feed the Provence canal. The water then passes through the Galerie des Maurras and other open galleries and canals to reach the [[Canal de Provence]] near [[Rians, Var|Rians]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lac D Esparron}}\n[[Category:Lakes of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur|Esparron]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox lake\n| name               = Lac d'Esparron\n| image              = Panorama du Lac d'Esparron.jpg\n| caption            =\n| image_bathymetry   =\n| caption_bathymetry =\n| location           = [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]\n| coords             = {{coord|43|44|N|5|58|E|region:FR_source:frwiki_type:waterbody|display=inline,title}}\n| type               = [[artificial lake|artificial]]\n| inflow             = [[Verdon River]]\n| outflow            = [[Verdon River]]\n| catchment          =\n| basin_countries    = France\n| length             =\n| width              =\n| area               = {{convert|3.28|km2|abbr=on}}\n| depth              =\n| max-depth          = {{convert|55|m|abbr=on}}\n| volume             = {{convert|80000000|m3|abbr=on}}\n| residence_time     =\n| shore              =\n| elevation          = {{convert|359|m|abbr=on}}\n| frozen             =\n| islands            =\n| cities             = [[Esparron-de-Verdon]]\n| reference          = [[Esparron-de-Verdon]]\n}}\n'''Lac d'Esparron''' is an artificial [[reservoir]], filled in 1967 following the construction of the hydroelectric dam in Gr\u00e9oux on the course of the [[Verdon River|Verdon]] river.
