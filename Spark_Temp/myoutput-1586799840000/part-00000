It quickly found work producing large numbers of combat aircraft on behalf of the French military. However, following the end of the conflict, a major glut in surplus aircraft and the cancellation of many outstanding orders rapidly pushed the company into dire straights. Some officials, like Bloch, decided to withdraw from the aviation sector entirely in light of the poor economic prospects of the early 1920s aviation market.\n\n==History==\nThe formation of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Etudes A\u00e9ronautiques (SEA) can be largely attributed to the undertakings of two French engineers, [[Henry Potez]] and [[Marcel Dassault|Marcel Bloch]].<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Prior to SEA, Potez and Bloch had been talented [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]s that decided to form a partnership to development and manufacture of their original design of [[propeller]]s, establishing the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des H\u00e9lices \u00c9clair]]. However, they soon sought to go beyond just manufacturing components, but to undertake the design and construction of whole aircraft, thus, they both joined forces with another friend, [[Louis Coroller]], to establish SEA.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> Its founding coincided with the [[First World War]], and thus much of its activity was heavily influenced by the demands and lack thereof from this conflict.<ref name = \"official hist\"/>\n\nThe company was originally engaged to manufacture the [[SPAD VII]] fighter [[licensed production|under licence]].<ref name = \"bill 371\"/> However, it soon developed its original designs and put those into production as well. Several early aircraft, starting with the [[SEA I]], proved somewhat unsatisfactory and requiring further development.<ref name = \"official hist\"/> However, one such aircraft, the [[SEA IV]], was selected for production for the French military. Once orders for 1,000 aircraft had been placed, Potez and Bloch founded a separate company, the ''Compagnie Anjou A\u00e9ronautique'' (\"Anjou Aeronautical Company\"), to undertake their production. This entity was established at [[Angers]] with a new partner [[Julien Bessonneau]]. However, the outstanding production order would ultimately be cancelled, causing fatal economic hardship for both companies.<ref name = \"bill 371\"/>\n\nHowever, the company's fortune quickly reversed following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] that marked the end of the conflict. Without a major ongoing war driving demand, peace quickly led to a major downturn in the sale and production of aircraft, pushing many aviation companies to the brink. The French Government's aircraft manufacturing department allegedly lacked interest in providing support to any of the nation's manufacturers.
