The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque P.350</ref> Medina Ridge is the name American troops gave to a low rise, approximately seven miles (11&nbsp;km) long.\n\nThe battle, which was waged over approximately two hours, was considered by some sources the largest tank battle of the war.<ref>VUA Citation</ref> It took place west of [[Phase line (cartography)|Phase Line]] Kiwi, east of Phase Line Smash, and north of Phase Line Grape. Phase lines are map references occurring every few kilometers used to measure progress of an offensive operation.\n\n==History==\nThe 1st Armored Division, commanded by Major General Ron Griffith, consisted of some 3,000 vehicles including 348 [[M1A1 Abrams]] tanks. The 1st Armored Division's Cavalry Squadron\u20141-1 Cavalry\u2014made contact with the Medina Division and informed the Division Commander of the location of the enemy forces.  1st Armored Division's 2nd Brigade (comprising three battalions TF 4-70th Armor, TF 2-70th Armor and TF 1-35th Armor) saw major action in this battle and was commanded by Colonel [[Montgomery Meigs (born 1945)|Montgomery Meigs]] (a descendant of General [[Montgomery C. Meigs]] of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] fame)  3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, commanded by Colonel James Riley replaced 1st Armored Division's 1st Brigade for the duration of the war and was also heavily involved in the battle.<ref>Jayhawk! The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque, p.27</ref>\n\nMedina Ridge was one of the few battles during [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]] in which American forces encountered significant [[Iraq]]i resistance and found it extremely difficult to advance. The Iraqi forces were well-deployed such that they could not be seen by American forces advancing until after they had cleared the top of the ridgeline. This [[reverse slope defence|reverse slope position]] was intended to give the Iraqis protection from the powerful long-range direct fire of the [[M1 Abrams]] tanks and the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M2 Bradley]] [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s. \n\nDuring the battle the American forces destroyed 186 Iraqi tanks (mostly [[T-72|T-72M]]s, [[Asad Babil]]s and obsolete [[Type 69/79|Type 69]]s) and 127 armored vehicles.<ref>Carhart, Tom (1994).

Evidence suggests that some of them were hit by Iraqi T-72 fire.<ref name=\"Forty\">George Forty cites an M1A1 tank platoon leader from TF 1-37: \"Speculation continues concerning what knocked out our four tanks. The three most probable answers are T-72 main gun, dismounted anti-tank missile, or Apache launched Hellfire missile. The fact that Apaches were operating to our rear and witnesses' reports of high round trajectory support the friendly fire theory. However, ballistics reports suggest that 125&nbsp;mm HEAT rounds produced the damage on some of the tanks. Visual examination of others reveals one obvious sabot hole. Overall, the physical evidence implies that T-72 fire took out our tanks, but the friendly fire possibility cannot be excluded.\"</ref> Ballistics reports have further confirmed this as well as physical evidence such as obvious sabot holes.<ref name=\"Forty\"/>  All four were lost.<ref>Carhart, Tom (1994). Iron Soldiers: How America's 1st Armored Division Crushed Iraq's Elite Republican Guard. New York: Random House. p.323 {{ISBN|0671791656}}</ref> Thirty-eight of the Iraqi tanks were destroyed by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[AH-64 Apache]]s and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Thunderbolt II]]s. The 75th Field Artillery Brigade and Battery B, 25th Field Artillery, the division's target acquisition battery, conducted counterartillery fire missions and destroyed two Medina Field Artillery battalions in the process.<ref>Jayhawk!

On February 26, the 3rd Brigade was ordered to attack east to gain contact with and destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command in zone. The 3rd Brigade began an aggressive and continuous movement to contact which covered 74 km in 12 hours, while fighting multiple engagements throughout the day and night with elements of the 52nd Armored Division, 17th, Adnan, and Tawakalna Divisions.

As the Brigade attacked and fought through the Adnan Division, securing a RGFC major logistics base, it captured 465 POWs and made contact with the Medina Armored Division, which was augmented by elements of four other Iraqi divisions. A fierce battle ensued culminating in the destruction of 82 tanks, 31 Armored Personnel Carriers, 11 artillery pieces, 48 trucks, 3 AAA guns and captured 72 POWs for the loss of 2 Bradley Cavalry vehicles, 1 soldier killed, and 30 soldiers wounded.<ref name=\"VUA\"/> \n \nWhile conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command.

Executing an aggressive and continuous movement, the 3rd Brigade fought numerous engagements. The Brigade made contact with a tank battalion defending the western flank of a RGFC's major logistics base. The 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division raced eastward at a rate of 15 kilometres per hour. In 24 hours of nearly continuous combat, the 3rd Brigade destroyed or captured 547 vehicles, including 102 tanks, 81 armored personnel carriers, 34 artillery pieces, 15 AAA guns and captured hundreds of tons of supplies and 528 POWs. The 3rd Brigade completed this exemplary action without the loss of a single soldier or vehicle and only three soldiers WIA.<ref name=\"VUA\"/> \n\n1st Armored Division's aviation assets conducted thirty-nine straight hours of continuous combat operations, rotating companies into and out of the battle prior to and after the actions at Medina Ridge. Attack helicopters maintained a steady destructive presence in front of the Division, engaging targets of opportunity and rapidly shifting their focus and combat power as the scenario required. The Brigade's final battle commenced when the Division raced to clear its zone of advance to the Kuwaiti border prior to the impending cease-fire.<ref name=\"VUA\"/> \n\nAlthough the Iraqis used a correct defensive tactic by deploying their armor behind the ridge, this was not properly repeated through the rest of the war. In one incident, an Iraqi commander attempted to repeat what had been done at Medina but mistakenly deployed his armor too far from the ridgeline.<ref>Jayhawk! The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque, p.355</ref>  This gave the American units the upper hand, as the Abrams tanks specialize in long-distance kills; their [[Chobham armor]] is extremely resistant to long-range fire. The American height advantage also reduced the effective range of the Iraqi tanks and presented the Iraqi gunners with a targeting situation for which they were under-trained.<ref>Jayhawk! The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque, p.355</ref> \n\nNevertheless, the Iraqis had fought hard, shooting down an A-10 Thunderbolt II,<ref>\"The Iraqis had skillfully dug in and camouflaged their firing line and placed a formidable protective ring of antiaircraft guns around it.

Dyer, was alerted for deployment to the [[Persian Gulf]] on 8 November 1990. 1\u201337 Armor was the first brigade unit from [[Vilseck]] to deploy. 1\u201337 Armor was attached to the 3rd \"Bulldog\" Brigade from [[Warner Barracks in Bamberg, Germany|Warner Barracks in Bamberg]], Germany, under their former commander, Colonel Daniel Zannini. A small advance party deployed on 14 December and the main body began departing on 26 December. By 30 December, the battalion had arrived in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Vehicles and equipment which had been shipped from ports in Europe began to arrive on 4 January and by 12 January all the equipment had arrived. When hostilities commenced on 15 January 1991, the battalion was in the process of closing the last elements into TAA Thompson. The next month was spent task organizing, training, rehearsing, and preparing for the ground war.\n\nOn 24 February, Task Force 1\u201337 crossed the line of departure as part of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]]' attack against Iraqi forces. On 25 February, the battalion attacked and seized the division headquarters of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division destroying four [[armored vehicles]], eight air defense weapons and captured over forty [[Enemy Prisoners of War]] (EPW). After attacking all day on 26 February, TF 1\u201337, part of 3rd Brigade, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], made contact with a brigade of the Tawakalna Armored Division of the [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] Forces Command (RGFC) which had established a defensive position to protect the flank of the RGFC and facilitate their escape from [[Kuwait]]. After a thirty-minute fire fight, TF 1\u201337 was ordered to assault the enemy position. The assault, conducted at night, in driving rain, resulted in the destruction of twenty-six [[T-72]] tanks, 47 [[armored personnel carriers]] (mostly [[BMP-1|BMP]]'s) and a handful of other vehicles, as well as the capture of over one hundred EPWs. TF 1\u201337 suffered the loss of four [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]] tanks destroyed and six personnel wounded in action. After consolidation and reorganization, the task force continued the attack throughout the night of 26\u201327 February, reestablishing contact with the RGFC at approximately 0530, 27 February. The task force continued to attack, fighting numerous engagements with elements of multiple Iraqi divisions throughout the 27th and into the morning of the 28 February. At 0800 local time, 28 February, the task force established a hasty defensive position astride the Iraq-Kuwait border. During the last 28 hours of the attack, TF 1\u201337 destroyed an additional thirty-one tanks, thirty-one BMPs, numerous other [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]s, air defense weapons and trucks, and captured over 200 EPWs.\n\nFour days after the [[cease fire]], TF 1\u201337 moved nine miles (14&nbsp;km) further into [[Kuwait]]. Two missions were conducted to destroy additional enemy weapons, ammunition and equipment, bury enemy remains, and to recover the four [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]]'s which had been destroyed on 26 February.\n\nOn 24 March, TF 1\u201337 moved back into [[Iraq]] and established a defensive position in the vicinity of the Rumayilah oil fields. For the next three weeks, task force missions centered on refugee assistance and security operations. On 10 April, TF 1\u201337 began movement to the Rear Assembly Area (RAA) in the vicinity of [[King Khalid Military City]] (KKMC), [[Saudi Arabia]]. By 13 April, the task force had closed into the RAA and preparations began for the redeployment of the unit to Germany.\n\nOn 16 August 1991 the 1st Brigade, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] was redesignated as the 3d Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3d Infantry Division]].\n\n== Unit Citations ==\n\n===2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division Valorous Unit Award Citation===\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division distinguished itself by gallantry in action from 26 to 28 February 1991, while conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command during operation DESERT STORM.

The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque P.350</ref> Medina Ridge is the name American troops gave to a low rise, approximately seven miles (11&nbsp;km) long.\n\nThe battle, which was waged over approximately two hours, was considered by some sources the largest tank battle of the war.<ref>VUA Citation</ref> It took place west of [[Phase line (cartography)|Phase Line]] Kiwi, east of Phase Line Smash, and north of Phase Line Grape. Phase lines are map references occurring every few kilometers used to measure progress of an offensive operation.\n\n==History==\nThe 1st Armored Division, commanded by Major General Ron Griffith, consisted of some 3,000 vehicles including 348 [[M1A1 Abrams]] tanks. The 1st Armored Division's Cavalry Squadron\u20141-1 Cavalry\u2014made contact with the Medina Division and informed the Division Commander of the location of the enemy forces.  1st Armored Division's 2nd Brigade (comprising three battalions TF 4-70th Armor, TF 2-70th Armor and TF 1-35th Armor) saw major action in this battle and was commanded by Colonel [[Montgomery Meigs (born 1945)|Montgomery Meigs]] (a descendant of General [[Montgomery C. Meigs]] of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] fame)  3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, commanded by Colonel James Riley replaced 1st Armored Division's 1st Brigade for the duration of the war and was also heavily involved in the battle.<ref>Jayhawk! The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque, p.27</ref>\n\nMedina Ridge was one of the few battles during [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]] in which American forces encountered significant [[Iraq]]i resistance and found it extremely difficult to advance. The Iraqi forces were well-deployed such that they could not be seen by American forces advancing until after they had cleared the top of the ridgeline. This [[reverse slope defence|reverse slope position]] was intended to give the Iraqis protection from the powerful long-range direct fire of the [[M1 Abrams]] tanks and the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M2 Bradley]] [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s. \n\nDuring the battle the American forces destroyed 186 Iraqi tanks (mostly [[T-72|T-72M]]s, [[Asad Babil]]s and obsolete [[Type 69/79|Type 69]]s) and 127 armored vehicles.<ref>Carhart, Tom (1994).

Evidence suggests that some of them were hit by Iraqi T-72 fire.<ref name=\"Forty\">George Forty cites an M1A1 tank platoon leader from TF 1-37: \"Speculation continues concerning what knocked out our four tanks. The three most probable answers are T-72 main gun, dismounted anti-tank missile, or Apache launched Hellfire missile. The fact that Apaches were operating to our rear and witnesses' reports of high round trajectory support the friendly fire theory. However, ballistics reports suggest that 125&nbsp;mm HEAT rounds produced the damage on some of the tanks. Visual examination of others reveals one obvious sabot hole. Overall, the physical evidence implies that T-72 fire took out our tanks, but the friendly fire possibility cannot be excluded.\"</ref> Ballistics reports have further confirmed this as well as physical evidence such as obvious sabot holes.<ref name=\"Forty\"/>  All four were lost.<ref>Carhart, Tom (1994).

On February 26, the 3rd Brigade was ordered to attack east to gain contact with and destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command in zone. The 3d Brigade began an aggressive and continuous movement to contact which covered 74km in 12  hours, while fighting multiple engagements throughout the day and night with elements of the 52nd Armored Division, 17th, Adnan, and Tawakalna Divisions.

As the Brigade attacked and fought through the Adnan Division, securing a RGFC major logistics base, it captured 465 POWs and made contact with the Medina Armored Division, which was augmented by elements of four other Iraqi divisions. A fierce battle ensued culminating in the destruction of 82 tanks, 31 Armored Personnel Carriers, 11 artillery pieces, 48 trucks, 3 AAA guns and captured 72 POWs for the loss of 2 Bradley Cavalry vehicles, 1 soldier killed, and 30 soldiers wounded.<ref name=\"VUA\"/> \n \nWhile conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command.

Executing an aggressive and continuous movement, the 3rd Brigade fought numerous engagements. The Brigade made contact with a tank battalion defending the western flank of a RGFC's major logistics base. The 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division raced eastward at a rate of 15 kilometers per hour. In 24 hours of nearly continuous combat, the 3rd Brigade destroyed or captured 547 vehicles, including 102 tanks, 81 armored personnel carriers, 34 artillery pieces, 15 AAA guns and captured hundreds of tons of supplies and 528 POWs.

Attack helicopters maintained a steady destructive presence in front of the Division, engaging targets of opportunity and rapidly shifting their focus and combat power as the scenario required. The Brigade's final battle commenced when the Division raced to clear its zone of advance to the Kuwaiti border prior to the impending cease-fire.<ref name=\"VUA\"/> \n\nAlthough the Iraqis used a correct defensive tactic by deploying their armor behind the ridge, this was not properly repeated through the rest of the war. In one incident, an Iraqi commander attempted to repeat what had been done at Medina but mistakenly deployed his armor too far from the ridgeline.<ref>Jayhawk! The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque, p.355</ref>  This gave the American units the upper hand, as the Abrams tanks specialize in long-distance kills; their [[Chobham armor]] is extremely resistant to long-range fire. The American height advantage also reduced the effective range of the Iraqi tanks and presented the Iraqi gunners with a targeting situation for which they were under-trained.<ref>Jayhawk!

Dyer, was alerted for deployment to the [[Persian Gulf]] on 8 November 1990. 1\u201337 Armor was the first brigade unit from [[Vilseck]] to deploy. 1\u201337 Armor was attached to the 3rd \"Bulldog\" Brigade from [[Warner Barracks in Bamberg, Germany|Warner Barracks in Bamberg]], Germany, under their former commander, Colonel Daniel Zannini. A small advance party deployed on 14 December and the main body began departing on 26 December. By 30 December, the battalion had arrived in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Vehicles and equipment which had been shipped from ports in Europe began to arrive on 4 January and by 12 January all the equipment had arrived. When hostilities commenced on 15 January 1991, the battalion was in the process of closing the last elements into TAA Thompson. The next month was spent task organizing, training, rehearsing, and preparing for the ground war.\n\nOn 24 February, Task Force 1\u201337 crossed the line of departure as part of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]]' attack against Iraqi forces. On 25 February, the battalion attacked and seized the division headquarters of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division destroying four [[armored vehicles]], eight air defense weapons and captured over forty [[Enemy Prisoners of War]] (EPW). After attacking all day on 26 February, TF 1\u201337, part of 3rd Brigade, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], made contact with a brigade of the Tawakalna Armored Division of the [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] Forces Command (RGFC) which had established a defensive position to protect the flank of the RGFC and facilitate their escape from [[Kuwait]]. After a thirty-minute fire fight, TF 1\u201337 was ordered to assault the enemy position. The assault, conducted at night, in driving rain, resulted in the destruction of twenty-six [[T-72]] tanks, 47 [[armored personnel carriers]] (mostly [[BMP-1|BMP]]'s) and a handful of other vehicles, as well as the capture of over one hundred EPWs. TF 1\u201337 suffered the loss of four [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]] tanks destroyed and six personnel wounded in action. After consolidation and reorganization, the task force continued the attack throughout the night of 26\u201327 February, reestablishing contact with the RGFC at approximately 0530, 27 February. The task force continued to attack, fighting numerous engagements with elements of multiple Iraqi divisions throughout the 27th and into the morning of the 28 February. At 0800 local time, 28 February, the task force established a hasty defensive position astride the Iraq-Kuwait border. During the last 28 hours of the attack, TF 1\u201337 destroyed an additional thirty-one tanks, thirty-one BMPs, numerous other [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]s, air defense weapons and trucks, and captured over 200 EPWs.\n\nFour days after the [[cease fire]], TF 1\u201337 moved nine miles (14&nbsp;km) further into [[Kuwait]]. Two missions were conducted to destroy additional enemy weapons, ammunition and equipment, bury enemy remains, and to recover the four [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]]'s which had been destroyed on 26 February.\n\nOn 24 March, TF 1\u201337 moved back into [[Iraq]] and established a defensive position in the vicinity of the Rumayilah oil fields. For the next three weeks, task force missions centered on refugee assistance and security operations. On 10 April, TF 1\u201337 began movement to the Rear Assembly Area (RAA) in the vicinity of [[King Khalid Military City]] (KKMC), [[Saudi Arabia]]. By 13 April, the task force had closed into the RAA and preparations began for the redeployment of the unit to Germany.\n\nOn 16 August 1991 the 1st Brigade, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] was redesignated as the 3d Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3d Infantry Division]].\n\n== Unit Citations ==\n\n===2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division Valorous Unit Award Citation===\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division distinguished itself by gallantry in action from 26 to 28 February 1991, while conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command during operation DESERT STORM.
