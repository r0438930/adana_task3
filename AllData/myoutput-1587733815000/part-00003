The town area spreads along the valley of the river [[Lahn]] and has a population of approximately 72,000.\n\nHaving been awarded [[town privileges]] in 1222, Marburg served as capital of the [[Landgrave|landgraviate]] of [[Hessen-Marburg]] during periods of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries. The [[University of Marburg]] was founded in 1527 and dominates the public life in the town to this day.\n\n== History ==\n=== Founding and early history ===\nLike many settlements, Marburg developed at the crossroads of two important early medieval highways: the trade route linking [[Cologne]] and [[Prague]] and the trade route from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Alps]] and on to [[Italy]], the former crossing the river [[Lahn]] here. The settlement was protected and customs were raised by a small castle built during the ninth or tenth century by the Giso. Marburg has been a town since 1140, as proven by coins. From the Gisos, it fell around that time to the [[Graf|Landgraves]] of [[Thuringia]], residing on the [[Wartburg]] above [[Eisenach]].\n\n=== St. Elizabeth of Hungary ===\nIn 1228, the widowed princess-landgravine of Thuringia, [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], chose Marburg as her dowager seat, as she did not get along well with her brother-in-law, the new landgrave. The countess dedicated her life to the sick and would become after her early death in 1231, aged 24, one of the most prominent female saints of the era. She was canonized in 1235.\n\n[[File:Elisabethkirche Marburg.jpg|thumb|[[St. Elizabeth Church (Marburg)]]]]\n\n=== Capital of Hessen ===\nIn 1264, St Elizabeth's daughter [[Sophie of Thuringia, Duchess of Brabant|Sophie of Brabant]], succeeded in winning the [[Landgrave|Landgraviate]] of [[Landgraviate of Hessen|Hessen]], hitherto connected to [[Thuringia]], for her son [[Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse|Henry]]. Marburg (alongside [[Kassel]]) was one of the capitals of Hessen from that time until about 1540. Following the first division of the landgraviate, it was the capital of [[Hessen-Marburg]] from 1485 to 1500 and again between 1567 and 1605. Hessen was one of the more powerful second-tier principalities in Germany. Its \"old enemy\" was the [[Electorate of Mainz|Archbishopric of Mainz]], one of the [[prince-elector]]s, who competed with Hessen in many wars and conflicts for coveted territory, stretching over several centuries.\n[[File:Marburg Braun-Hogenberg.jpg|thumb|left|Marburg from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'', 1572]]\n\nAfter 1605, Marburg became just another provincial town, known mostly for the [[University of Marburg]]. It became a virtual backwater for two centuries after the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), when it was fought over by [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hessen-Darmstadt]] and [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]]. The Hessian territory around Marburg lost more than two-thirds of its population, which was more than in any later wars (including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]) combined.\n\n=== Reformation ===\nMarburg is the seat of the oldest [[Protestantism|Protestant]]-founded [[university]] in the world, the [[University of Marburg]] (Philipps-Universit\u00e4t-Marburg), founded in 1527. It is one of the smaller \"university towns\" in Germany: [[Greifswald]], [[Erlangen]], [[Jena]], and [[T\u00fcbingen]], as well as the city of [[Gie\u00dfen]], which is located 30&nbsp;km south of Marburg.\n\nIn 1529, [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philipp I of Hesse]] arranged the [[Marburg Colloquy]], to propitiate [[Martin Luther]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].\n\n[[File:Marburg an der Lahn.jpg|thumb|Marburg on the Lahn]]\n\n=== Romanticism ===\nOwing to its neglect during the entire eighteenth century, Marburg \u2013 like [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] or [[Chartres]] \u2013 survived as a relatively intact [[Gothic art|Gothic]] town, simply because there was no money spent on any new [[architecture]] or expansion. When [[Romanticism]] became the dominant cultural and artistic paradigm in Germany, Marburg became interesting once again, and many of the leaders of the movement lived, taught, or studied in Marburg. They formed a circle of friends that was of great importance, especially in [[literature]], [[philology]], [[folklore]], and [[law]]. The group included [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]], the most important [[jurist]] of his day and father of the [[Roman Law]] adaptation in Germany; the poets, writers, and social activists [[Achim von Arnim]], [[Clemens Brentano]], and especially the latter's sister and the former's later wife, [[Bettina von Arnim]]. Most famous internationally, however, were the [[Brothers Grimm]], who collected many of their [[fairy tales]] here. The original building inspiring his drawing ''[[Rapunzel]]'s Tower'' stands in Am\u00f6nau near Marburg. Across the Lahn hills, in the area called Schwalm, the costumes of little girls included a red hood.\n\n=== Prussian town ===\nIn the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, the  [[Prince-elector]] of Hessen had backed [[Austria]]. Prussia won and took the opportunity to invade and annex the [[Electorate of Hessen]] (as well as [[Hanover]], the city of [[Frankfurt]], and other territories) north of the [[Main (river)|Main]] River. However, the pro-Austrian [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]] remained independent. For Marburg, this turn of events was very positive, because Prussia decided to make Marburg its main administrative centre in this part of the new province [[Hessen-Nassau]] and to turn the [[University of Marburg]] into the regional academic centre. Thus, Marburg's rise as an administrative and university city began. As the Prussian university system was one of the best in the world at the time, Marburg attracted many respected scholars. However, there was hardly any industry to speak of, so students, professors, and civil servants \u2013 who generally had enough but not much money and paid very little in taxes \u2013 dominated the town, which tended to be very conservative.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n{{update|section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Marburg 30.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Wettergasse in the Old City]]\n[[Franz von Papen]], vice-chancellor of Germany in 1934, delivered [[Marburg speech|an anti-Nazi speech]] at the University of Marburg on 17 June.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945, the whole city of Marburg was turned into a hospital with schools and government buildings turned into wards to augment the existing hospitals. By the spring of 1945, there were over 20,000 patients \u2013 mostly wounded German soldiers. As a result of its being designated a hospital city, there was not much damage from bombings except along the railroad tracks.\n\nIn 1945, the [[St. Elisabeth's Church (Marburg)|Elisabethkirche]] in Marburg became the final resting place of Field Marshal and President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] (1847-1934). He is also an honorary citizen of the town.\n\n== Politics ==\nAs a larger mid-sized city, Marburg, like six other such cities in Hessen, has a special status as compared to the other municipalities in the district. This means that the city takes on tasks more usually performed by the district so that in many ways it is comparable to an [[Urban districts of Germany|urban district]] (''kreisfreie Stadt'').\n\nThe [[List of mayors of Marburg|mayor of Marburg]], Thomas Spies, in office since December 2015, and his predecessor [[Egon Vaupel]] (directly elected in January 2005), are from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. His deputy, the head of the building and youth departments, Dr. Franz Kahle, is from [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]. The majority in the 59-seat city parliament is held by a coalition of SPD (22 seats) and Green (13 seats) members. Also represented are the factions of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (14 seats), [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (4 seats), the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (2 seats), a CDU splinter group MBL (''Marburger B\u00fcrgerliste'' \u2013 2 seats), the BfM (''B\u00fcrger f\u00fcr Marburg'' \u2013 1 seat) and the [[Pirate Party Germany|Pirate Party]] (1 seat).\n\nAmong the left wing groups are [[Association pour la taxation des transactions pour l'aide aux citoyens|ATTAC]], the [[Worldshop]] movement, an [[Autonomism|autonomist]]-[[Anarchism|anarchist]] scene, and a few groups engaged in ecological or human-rights concerns.\n\nThe city of Marburg, similar to the cities of [[Heidelberg]], [[T\u00fcbingen]] and [[G\u00f6ttingen]], has a rich history of student fraternities or ''[[Studentenverbindung|Verbindungen]]'' of various sorts, including Corps, Landsmannschaften, Burschenschaften, Turnierschaften, etc.\n\n==Twin towns - sister cities==\nMarburg is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Partnerst\u00e4dte|url=https://www.marburg.de/portal/seiten/partnerstaedte-900001084-23001.html|website=marburg.de|publisher=Marburg|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Poitiers]], France, since 1961\n*{{flagicon|SVN}} [[Maribor]], Slovenia, since 1969\n*{{flagicon|TUN}} [[Sfax]], Tunisia, since 1971\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Eisenach]], Germany, since 1988\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Northampton]], United Kingdom, since 1992\n*{{flagicon|ROU}} [[Sibiu]], Romania, since 2005\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Coat of arms==\nMarburg's coat of arms shows a Hessian landgrave riding a white horse with a flag and a shield on a red background. The shield shows the red-and-white-striped Hessian lion, also to be seen on Hessen's state arms, and the flag shows a stylized M, blue on gold (or yellow). The arms are also the source of the city flag's colors. The flag has three horizontal stripes colored, from top to bottom, red (from the background), white (from the horse) and blue (from the shield).\n\nThe coat of arms, which was designed in the late nineteenth century, is based on a landgrave seal on a municipal document. It is an example of a very prevalent practice of replacing forgotten coats of arms, or ones deemed not to be representative enough, with motifs taken from seals.\n\n== Marburg virus ==\n{{Main|Marburg virus}}\nThe city's name is connected to a [[filovirus]], the [[Marburg virus]], because this [[Marburg virus disease|disease]], a [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] resembling [[ebola]], was first recognized and described during an outbreak in the city. In 1967, workers were accidentally exposed to infected [[green monkey]] tissue at the city's former industrial plant, the Behring-Werke, then part of Hoechst and today of [[CSL Behring]], founded by Marburg citizen and first [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] winner, [[Emil Adolf von Behring]]. During the outbreak, 31 people became infected and seven of them died. The virus is named after the city following the custom of naming viruses after the location of their first recorded outbreak.\n\n== Green city ==\nMany homes have solar panels and in 2008 a law was passed to make the installation of solar systems on new buildings or as part of renovation projects mandatory. 20 percent of heating system requirements ought to have been covered by solar energy in new buildings. Anyone who fails to install solar panels would have been fined \u20ac1,000. The new law, approved on 20 June 2008, should have taken effect in October 2008,<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/21/europe/EU-GEN-Germany-Solar.php German college town Marburg becomes first in the nation to require solar panels on new buildings, International Herald Tribune]</ref> however, this law was stopped by the Regierungspr\u00e4sidium Giessen in September 2008.<ref>[http://www.faz.net/s/Rub5785324EF29440359B02AF69CB1BB8CC/Doc~EA619A3ED4C284B459E1CBD529351BAF5~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Marburger Solarsatzung vor dem aus (in german)]</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\n{{Weather box\n|location=Marburg\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high C=\n|Feb record high C=\n|Mar record high C=\n|Apr record high C=\n|May record high C=\n|Jun record high C=\n|Jul record high C=\n|Aug record high C=\n|Sep record high C=\n|Oct record high C=\n|Nov record high C=\n|Dec record high C=\n|year record high C=\n|Jan high C=2.3\n|Feb high C=4\n|Mar high C=8.7\n|Apr high C=13.6\n|May high C=18.2\n|Jun high C=21.4\n|Jul high C=23\n|Aug high C=22.5\n|Sep high C=19.2\n|Oct high C=13.3\n|Nov high C=7.1\n|Dec high C=3.6\n|year high C=\n|Jan mean C= -0.1\n|Feb mean C= 1.2\n|Mar mean C= 4.6\n|Apr mean C= 8.8\n|May mean C= 12.9\n|Jun mean C= 16.1\n|Jul mean C= 17.8\n|Aug mean C= 17.4\n|Sep mean C= 14.3\n|Oct mean C= 9.5\n|Nov mean C= 4.6\n|Dec mean C= 1.4\n|year mean C=\n|Jan low C=-2.4\n|Feb low C=-1.5\n|Mar low C=0.6\n|Apr low C=4\n|May low C=7.7\n|Jun low C=10.9\n|Jul low C=12.6\n|Aug low C=12.3\n|Sep low C=9.5\n|Oct low C=5.8\n|Nov low C=2.1\n|Dec low C=-0.7\n|year low C=\n|Jan record low C=\n|Feb record low C=\n|Mar record low C=\n|Apr record low C=\n|May record low C=\n|Jun record low C=\n|Jul record low C=\n|Aug record low C=\n|Sep record low C=\n|Oct record low C=\n|Nov record low C=\n|Dec record low C=\n|year record low C=\n|precipitation colour= green\n|Jan precipitation mm=\n|Feb precipitation mm=\n|Mar precipitation mm=\n|Apr precipitation mm=\n|May precipitation mm=\n|Jun precipitation mm=\n|Jul precipitation mm=\n|Aug precipitation mm=\n|Sep precipitation mm=\n|Oct precipitation mm=\n|Nov precipitation mm=\n|Dec precipitation mm=\n|year precipitation mm=\n|rain colour= green\n|Jan rain mm= 57\n|Feb rain mm= 45\n|Mar rain mm= 58\n|Apr rain mm= 50\n|May rain mm= 70\n|Jun rain mm= 71\n|Jul rain mm= 68\n|Aug rain mm= 61\n|Sep rain mm= 60\n|Oct rain mm= 61\n|Nov rain mm= 57\n|Dec rain mm= 66\n|year rain mm= 724\n|unit precipitation days=\n|Jan precipitation days=\n|Feb precipitation days=\n|Mar precipitation days=\n|Apr precipitation days=\n|May precipitation days=\n|Jun precipitation days=\n|Jul precipitation days=\n|Aug precipitation days=\n|Sep precipitation days=\n|Oct precipitation days=\n|Nov precipitation days=\n|Dec precipitation days=\n|year precipitation days=\n|unit rain days=\n|Jan rain days=\n|Feb rain days=\n|Mar rain days=\n|Apr rain days=\n|May rain days=\n|Jun rain days=\n|Jul rain days=\n|Aug rain days=\n|Sep rain days=\n|Oct rain days=\n|Nov rain days=\n|Dec rain days=\n|year rain days=\n|source 1=[https://de.climate-data.org/location/22339/ Climate Marburg (Hesse) (in german)], accessed 19 December 2017\n|date=\n}}\n\n==Main sights and points of interest==\n[[File:Town hall Marburg and market place fountain in fog-night 2016-01-25.JPG|thumb|Town hall and market place with fountain (January&nbsp;2016)]]\nMarburg remains a relatively unspoilt, spire-dominated, castle-crowned Gothic or Renaissance city on a hill partly because it was isolated between 1600 and 1850. Architecturally, it is famous both for its castle [[Marburger Schloss]] and its medieval churches. The [[St. Elisabeth's Church (Marburg)|Elisabethkirche]], as one of the two or three first purely Gothic churches north of the Alps outside France, is an archetype of Gothic architecture in Germany.\n\nMuch of the physical attractiveness of Marburg is due to [[Hanno Drechsler]] who was Lord Mayor between 1970 and 1992. He promoted urban renewal, the restoration of the Oberstadt (uptown), and he established one of the first pedestrian zones in Germany. Marburg's ''Altstadtsanierung'' (since 1972) has received many awards and prizes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRxCklSBYPQC&q=Altstadtsanierung++Hanno+Drechsler&dq=Altstadtsanierung++Hanno+Drechsler&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwix04vOp7jlAhVRpFkKHQJ9A70Q6AEwA3oECAEQAg|title=Der St\u00e4dtetag|date=1992|isbn=9783555009018|language=de}}</ref>\n\nParks in the town include the [[Alter Botanischer Garten Marburg|Old Botanical Garden]], as well as [[Neuer Botanischer Garten Marburg|the new Botanical Garden]] outside the town proper.\n\nThe Marktplatz is the heart of Marburg's old town. In the center is a fountain dedicated to St. Georg, a popular meeting place for the youths. To the south is the old town hall and the path leading north winds its way up to the palace overlooking the town.\n\n==Sons and daughters of the town==\n=== Nineteenth century ===\n[[File:Karl Gustav Adolf Knies.jpg|thumb|150px|Karl Knies]]\n* Ernst Wachler (1803-1888), lawyer and politician\n* [[Karl Theodor Bayrhoffer]] (1812-1888), professor of philosophy at the University of Marburg and freethinkers\n* [[Karl Knies|Karl Gustav Adolf Knies]] (1821-1898), economist\n* [[Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick]] (1852-1937), ophthalmologist and inventor of the contact lens\n[[File:Adolf Fick.png|thumb|200px|Adolf Fick]]\n* [[Ernst von Harnack]] (1888-1945), politician and resistance fighter against Nazism\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n* [[Ernst-G\u00fcnther Schenck]] (1904-1998), doctor\n* [[Otto John]] (1909-1997), President of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection\n* [[Hans Mommsen]] (1930-2015), historian\n* [[Wolfgang Mommsen]] (1930-2004), historian\n* [[Reinhard Hauff]] (born 1939), film director and screenwriter\n* [[Margot K\u00e4\u00dfmann]] (born 1958), Lutheran theologian and pastor\n* [[Dirk Kaftan]] (born 1971), conductor\n* [[Lars Wei\u00dfenfeldt]] (born 1980), football player\n* [[Lena Gercke]] (born 1988), photo model and TV host\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;In English\n* {{Citation |publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publication-place = New York |title = The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |chapterurl = https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri17chisrich#page/680/mode/2up |chapter= Marburg |publication-date = 1910 |oclc = 14782424 |edition=11th }}\n* {{cite book\n|editor=John M.

Marburg (alongside [[Kassel]]) was one of the capitals of Hessen from that time until about 1540. Following the first division of the landgraviate, it was the capital of [[Hessen-Marburg]] from 1485 to 1500 and again between 1567 and 1605. Hessen was one of the more powerful second-tier principalities in Germany. Its \"old enemy\" was the [[Electorate of Mainz|Archbishopric of Mainz]], one of the [[prince-elector]]s, who competed with Hessen in many wars and conflicts for coveted territory, stretching over several centuries.\n[[File:Marburg Braun-Hogenberg.jpg|thumb|left|Marburg from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'', 1572]]\n\nAfter 1605, Marburg became just another provincial town, known mostly for the [[University of Marburg]]. It became a virtual backwater for two centuries after the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), when it was fought over by [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hessen-Darmstadt]] and [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]]. The Hessian territory around Marburg lost more than two-thirds of its population, which was more than in any later wars (including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]) combined.\n\n=== Reformation ===\nMarburg is the seat of the oldest [[Protestantism|Protestant]]-founded [[university]] in the world, the [[University of Marburg]] (Philipps-Universit\u00e4t-Marburg), founded in 1527. It is one of the smaller \"university towns\" in Germany: [[Greifswald]], [[Erlangen]], [[Jena]], and [[T\u00fcbingen]], as well as the city of [[Gie\u00dfen]], which is located 30&nbsp;km south of Marburg.\n\nIn 1529, [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philipp I of Hesse]] arranged the [[Marburg Colloquy]], to propitiate [[Martin Luther]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].\n\n[[File:Marburg an der Lahn.jpg|thumb|Marburg on the Lahn]]\n\n=== Romanticism ===\nOwing to its neglect during the entire eighteenth century, Marburg \u2013 like [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] or [[Chartres]] \u2013 survived as a relatively intact [[Gothic art|Gothic]] town, simply because there was no money spent on any new [[architecture]] or expansion. When [[Romanticism]] became the dominant cultural and artistic paradigm in Germany, Marburg became interesting once again, and many of the leaders of the movement lived, taught, or studied in Marburg. They formed a circle of friends that was of great importance, especially in [[literature]], [[philology]], [[folklore]], and [[law]]. The group included [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]], the most important [[jurist]] of his day and father of the [[Roman Law]] adaptation in Germany; the poets, writers, and social activists [[Achim von Arnim]], [[Clemens Brentano]], and especially the latter's sister and the former's later wife, [[Bettina von Arnim]]. Most famous internationally, however, were the [[Brothers Grimm]], who collected many of their [[fairy tales]] here. The original building inspiring his drawing ''[[Rapunzel]]'s Tower'' stands in Am\u00f6nau near Marburg. Across the Lahn hills, in the area called Schwalm, the costumes of little girls included a red hood.\n\n=== Prussian town ===\nIn the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, the  [[Prince-elector]] of Hessen had backed [[Austria]]. Prussia won and took the opportunity to invade and annex the [[Electorate of Hessen]] (as well as [[Hanover]], the city of [[Frankfurt]], and other territories) north of the [[Main (river)|Main]] River. However, the pro-Austrian [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]] remained independent. For Marburg, this turn of events was very positive, because Prussia decided to make Marburg its main administrative centre in this part of the new province [[Hessen-Nassau]] and to turn the [[University of Marburg]] into the regional academic centre. Thus, Marburg's rise as an administrative and university city began. As the Prussian university system was one of the best in the world at the time, Marburg attracted many respected scholars. However, there was hardly any industry to speak of, so students, professors, and civil servants \u2013 who generally had enough but not much money and paid very little in taxes \u2013 dominated the town, which tended to be very conservative.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n{{update|section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Marburg 30.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Wettergasse in the Old City]]\n[[Franz von Papen]], vice-chancellor of Germany in 1934, delivered [[Marburg speech|an anti-Nazi speech]] at the University of Marburg on 17 June.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945, the whole city of Marburg was turned into a hospital with schools and government buildings turned into wards to augment the existing hospitals. By the spring of 1945, there were over 20,000 patients \u2013 mostly wounded German soldiers. As a result of its being designated a hospital city, there was not much damage from bombings except along the railroad tracks.\n\nIn 1945, the [[St. Elisabeth's Church (Marburg)|Elisabethkirche]] in Marburg became the final resting place of Field Marshal and President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] (1847-1934). He is also an honorary citizen of the town.\n\n== Politics ==\nAs a larger mid-sized city, Marburg, like six other such cities in Hessen, has a special status as compared to the other municipalities in the district. This means that the city takes on tasks more usually performed by the district so that in many ways it is comparable to an [[Urban districts of Germany|urban district]] (''kreisfreie Stadt'').\n\nThe [[List of mayors of Marburg|mayor of Marburg]], Thomas Spies, in office since December 2015, and his predecessor [[Egon Vaupel]] (directly elected in January 2005), are from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. His deputy, the head of the building and youth departments, Dr. Franz Kahle, is from [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]. The majority in the 59-seat city parliament is held by a coalition of SPD (22 seats) and Green (13 seats) members. Also represented are the factions of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (14 seats), [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (4 seats), the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (2 seats), a CDU splinter group MBL (''Marburger B\u00fcrgerliste'' \u2013 2 seats), the BfM (''B\u00fcrger f\u00fcr Marburg'' \u2013 1 seat) and the [[Pirate Party Germany|Pirate Party]] (1 seat).\n\nAmong the left wing groups are [[Association pour la taxation des transactions pour l'aide aux citoyens|ATTAC]], the [[Worldshop]] movement, an [[Autonomism|autonomist]]-[[Anarchism|anarchist]] scene, and a few groups engaged in ecological or human-rights concerns.\n\nThe city of Marburg, similar to the cities of [[Heidelberg]], [[T\u00fcbingen]] and [[G\u00f6ttingen]], has a rich history of student fraternities or ''[[Studentenverbindung|Verbindungen]]'' of various sorts, including Corps, Landsmannschaften, Burschenschaften, Turnierschaften, etc.\n\n==Twin towns - sister cities==\nMarburg is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Partnerst\u00e4dte|url=https://www.marburg.de/portal/seiten/partnerstaedte-900001084-23001.html|website=marburg.de|publisher=Marburg|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Poitiers]], France, since 1961\n*{{flagicon|SVN}} [[Maribor]], Slovenia, since 1969\n*{{flagicon|TUN}} [[Sfax]], Tunisia, since 1971\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Eisenach]], Germany, since 1988\n*{{flagicon|ENG}} [[Northampton]], United Kingdom, since 1992\n*{{flagicon|ROU}} [[Sibiu]], Romania, since 2005\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Coat of arms==\nMarburg's coat of arms shows a Hessian landgrave riding a white horse with a flag and a shield on a red background. The shield shows the red-and-white-striped Hessian lion, also to be seen on Hessen's state arms, and the flag shows a stylized M, blue on gold (or yellow). The arms are also the source of the city flag's colors. The flag has three horizontal stripes colored, from top to bottom, red (from the background), white (from the horse) and blue (from the shield).\n\nThe coat of arms, which was designed in the late nineteenth century, is based on a landgrave seal on a municipal document. It is an example of a very prevalent practice of replacing forgotten coats of arms, or ones deemed not to be representative enough, with motifs taken from seals.\n\n== Marburg virus ==\n{{Main|Marburg virus}}\nThe city's name is connected to a [[filovirus]], the [[Marburg virus]], because this [[Marburg virus disease|disease]], a [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] resembling [[ebola]], was first recognized and described during an outbreak in the city. In 1967, workers were accidentally exposed to infected [[green monkey]] tissue at the city's former industrial plant, the Behring-Werke, then part of Hoechst and today of [[CSL Behring]], founded by Marburg citizen and first [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] winner, [[Emil Adolf von Behring]]. During the outbreak, 31 people became infected and seven of them died. The virus is named after the city following the custom of naming viruses after the location of their first recorded outbreak.\n\n== Green city ==\nMany homes have solar panels and in 2008 a law was passed to make the installation of solar systems on new buildings or as part of renovation projects mandatory. 20 percent of heating system requirements ought to have been covered by solar energy in new buildings. Anyone who fails to install solar panels would have been fined \u20ac1,000. The new law, approved on 20 June 2008, should have taken effect in October 2008,<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/21/europe/EU-GEN-Germany-Solar.php German college town Marburg becomes first in the nation to require solar panels on new buildings, International Herald Tribune]</ref> however, this law was stopped by the Regierungspr\u00e4sidium Giessen in September 2008.<ref>[http://www.faz.net/s/Rub5785324EF29440359B02AF69CB1BB8CC/Doc~EA619A3ED4C284B459E1CBD529351BAF5~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Marburger Solarsatzung vor dem aus (in german)]</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\n{{Weather box\n|location=Marburg\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high C=\n|Feb record high C=\n|Mar record high C=\n|Apr record high C=\n|May record high C=\n|Jun record high C=\n|Jul record high C=\n|Aug record high C=\n|Sep record high C=\n|Oct record high C=\n|Nov record high C=\n|Dec record high C=\n|year record high C=\n|Jan high C=2.3\n|Feb high C=4\n|Mar high C=8.7\n|Apr high C=13.6\n|May high C=18.2\n|Jun high C=21.4\n|Jul high C=23\n|Aug high C=22.5\n|Sep high C=19.2\n|Oct high C=13.3\n|Nov high C=7.1\n|Dec high C=3.6\n|year high C=\n|Jan mean C= -0.1\n|Feb mean C= 1.2\n|Mar mean C= 4.6\n|Apr mean C= 8.8\n|May mean C= 12.9\n|Jun mean C= 16.1\n|Jul mean C= 17.8\n|Aug mean C= 17.4\n|Sep mean C= 14.3\n|Oct mean C= 9.5\n|Nov mean C= 4.6\n|Dec mean C= 1.4\n|year mean C=\n|Jan low C=-2.4\n|Feb low C=-1.5\n|Mar low C=0.6\n|Apr low C=4\n|May low C=7.7\n|Jun low C=10.9\n|Jul low C=12.6\n|Aug low C=12.3\n|Sep low C=9.5\n|Oct low C=5.8\n|Nov low C=2.1\n|Dec low C=-0.7\n|year low C=\n|Jan record low C=\n|Feb record low C=\n|Mar record low C=\n|Apr record low C=\n|May record low C=\n|Jun record low C=\n|Jul record low C=\n|Aug record low C=\n|Sep record low C=\n|Oct record low C=\n|Nov record low C=\n|Dec record low C=\n|year record low C=\n|precipitation colour= green\n|Jan precipitation mm=\n|Feb precipitation mm=\n|Mar precipitation mm=\n|Apr precipitation mm=\n|May precipitation mm=\n|Jun precipitation mm=\n|Jul precipitation mm=\n|Aug precipitation mm=\n|Sep precipitation mm=\n|Oct precipitation mm=\n|Nov precipitation mm=\n|Dec precipitation mm=\n|year precipitation mm=\n|rain colour= green\n|Jan rain mm= 57\n|Feb rain mm= 45\n|Mar rain mm= 58\n|Apr rain mm= 50\n|May rain mm= 70\n|Jun rain mm= 71\n|Jul rain mm= 68\n|Aug rain mm= 61\n|Sep rain mm= 60\n|Oct rain mm= 61\n|Nov rain mm= 57\n|Dec rain mm= 66\n|year rain mm= 724\n|unit precipitation days=\n|Jan precipitation days=\n|Feb precipitation days=\n|Mar precipitation days=\n|Apr precipitation days=\n|May precipitation days=\n|Jun precipitation days=\n|Jul precipitation days=\n|Aug precipitation days=\n|Sep precipitation days=\n|Oct precipitation days=\n|Nov precipitation days=\n|Dec precipitation days=\n|year precipitation days=\n|unit rain days=\n|Jan rain days=\n|Feb rain days=\n|Mar rain days=\n|Apr rain days=\n|May rain days=\n|Jun rain days=\n|Jul rain days=\n|Aug rain days=\n|Sep rain days=\n|Oct rain days=\n|Nov rain days=\n|Dec rain days=\n|year rain days=\n|source 1=[https://de.climate-data.org/location/22339/ Climate Marburg (Hesse) (in german)], accessed 19 December 2017\n|date=\n}}\n\n==Main sights and points of interest==\n[[File:Town hall Marburg and market place fountain in fog-night 2016-01-25.JPG|thumb|Town hall and market place with fountain (January&nbsp;2016)]]\nMarburg remains a relatively unspoilt, spire-dominated, castle-crowned Gothic or Renaissance city on a hill partly because it was isolated between 1600 and 1850. Architecturally, it is famous both for its castle [[Marburger Schloss]] and its medieval churches. The [[St. Elisabeth's Church (Marburg)|Elisabethkirche]], as one of the two or three first purely Gothic churches north of the Alps outside France, is an archetype of Gothic architecture in Germany.\n\nMuch of the physical attractiveness of Marburg is due to [[Hanno Drechsler]] who was Lord Mayor between 1970 and 1992. He promoted urban renewal, the restoration of the Oberstadt (uptown), and he established one of the first pedestrian zones in Germany. Marburg's ''Altstadtsanierung'' (since 1972) has received many awards and prizes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRxCklSBYPQC&q=Altstadtsanierung++Hanno+Drechsler&dq=Altstadtsanierung++Hanno+Drechsler&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwix04vOp7jlAhVRpFkKHQJ9A70Q6AEwA3oECAEQAg|title=Der St\u00e4dtetag|date=1992|isbn=9783555009018|language=de}}</ref>\n\nParks in the town include the [[Alter Botanischer Garten Marburg|Old Botanical Garden]], as well as [[Neuer Botanischer Garten Marburg|the new Botanical Garden]] outside the town proper.\n\nThe Marktplatz is the heart of Marburg's old town. In the center is a fountain dedicated to St. Georg, a popular meeting place for students. To the south is the old town hall and the path leading north winds its way up to the palace overlooking the town.\n\n==Sons and daughters of the town==\n=== Nineteenth century ===\n[[File:Karl Gustav Adolf Knies.jpg|thumb|150px|Karl Knies]]\n* Ernst Wachler (1803-1888), lawyer and politician\n* [[Karl Theodor Bayrhoffer]] (1812-1888), professor of philosophy at the University of Marburg and freethinkers\n* [[Karl Knies|Karl Gustav Adolf Knies]] (1821-1898), economist\n* [[Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick]] (1852-1937), ophthalmologist and inventor of the contact lens\n[[File:Adolf Fick.png|thumb|200px|Adolf Fick]]\n* [[Ernst von Harnack]] (1888-1945), politician and resistance fighter against Nazism\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n* [[Ernst-G\u00fcnther Schenck]] (1904-1998), doctor\n* [[Otto John]] (1909-1997), President of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection\n* [[Hans Mommsen]] (1930-2015), historian\n* [[Wolfgang Mommsen]] (1930-2004), historian\n* [[Reinhard Hauff]] (born 1939), film director and screenwriter\n* [[Margot K\u00e4\u00dfmann]] (born 1958), Lutheran theologian and pastor\n* [[Dirk Kaftan]] (born 1971), conductor\n* [[Lars Wei\u00dfenfeldt]] (born 1980), football player\n* [[Lena Gercke]] (born 1988), photo model and TV host\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;In English\n* {{Citation |publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publication-place = New York |title = The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |chapterurl = https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri17chisrich#page/680/mode/2up |chapter= Marburg |publication-date = 1910 |oclc = 14782424 |edition=11th }}\n* {{cite book\n|editor=John M.
