An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on ''Encore'', he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount&nbsp;[...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30\". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to {{convert|230|lb|kg}}, and he was regularly eating [[fast food]]: \"The kids behind the counter knew me \u2013 it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad\". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain't fat.\"<ref name=\"RS10\"/>\n\nIn December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a [[methadone]] overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of [[heroin]] and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children,<!-- What other children? So far, we've just read about Hailie. --> Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully [[Detoxification|detoxed]]. He tore the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a [[seizure]]. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running.
