Interestingly, even the atheistic Buddhist Nirvana is not omitted: \"Itself Nirvana, It itself relishes pleasures\" (GGS: 97). \"God\" or \"gods\" or \"no god\" alike are recognized as part of the infinite One! \"Always, always you alone are the One Reality\u2014sada sada tun eku hai\" (GGS: 139).

Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\".

The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\".
