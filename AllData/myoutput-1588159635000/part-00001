He played [[high school football]] at Downsview High School in Toronto. After playing [[college football]] for [[Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles football|Tennessee Tech]], Abofs went on to play for the [[Toronto Argonauts]], the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], the [[BC Lions]], and the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]].<ref name=\"cpfe\" />\n\nAbofs found some success as a running back in his rookie year with Toronto, averaging 4.8 yards per carry, but is best known for his role in the [[59th Grey Cup]]. In the fourth quarter of the game with the Argonauts down 14-11, Abofs received a punt from the [[Calgary Stampeders]].  In an effort to capture the wet ball, he accidentally kicked it out of bounds while reaching down. CFL rules state that when a ball is kicked out of bounds, possession goes to the opposing team, thus giving Calgary possession once again. Had Abofs knocked the ball out of bounds with his hand, Toronto would have had one last offensive series. Instead, Calgary ran out the clock and ultimately captured their first Grey Cup since [[36th Grey Cup|1948]].<ref name=\"globemail2012\">{{cite news|last1=Maki|first1=Allan|title=Where are they now: The first family of Stampeders\u2019 football, the Forzani brothers|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/where-are-they-now-the-first-family-of-stampeders-football-the-forzani-brothers/article5542509/|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=The Globe and Mail|date=November 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAbofs was later converted to a defensive back by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]].
