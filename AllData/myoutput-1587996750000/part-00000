Among many other remarkable achievements, he was the only player in NHL history to score consecutive Stanley Cup winning goals (1982 and 1983) and the only player to record four game-winning goals in one series (1983 Conference Final). He is the NHL's all-time leader in average goals scored per regular season game, holds the NHL's third highest all-time average points scored per regular season game, and is one of only five players to score [[50 goals in 50 games]]. In 2017 Bossy was named one of the '[[100 Greatest NHL Players]]' in history.<ref name=\"100 Greatest NHL Players\">{{cite web|title=100 Greatest NHL Players|url=https://www.nhl.com/fans/nhl-centennial/100-greatest-nhl-players|website=NHL.com|accessdate=January 27, 2017|date=January 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nAs a youth, Bossy played in the 1969 [[Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament]] with a [[minor ice hockey]] team from [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publicationsports.com/ressources/files/439/Joueurs_Pro.pdf|title=Pee-Wee players who have reached NHL or WHA|year=2018|website=Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> He started his junior career with [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] at the age of 15. Despite scoring 309 goals in four seasons, he was considered a timid player by NHL scouts.\n\nIn the [[1977 NHL Amateur Draft]], he was passed over by twelve teams, with the [[New York Rangers]] and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] ignoring him twice. However, the New York Islanders made him their first choice, 15th overall. General manager [[Bill Torrey]] was torn at first between taking Bossy and [[Dwight Foster (ice hockey)|Dwight Foster]].  Bossy was known as a scorer who could not check, while Foster could check but was inferior offensively. Coach [[Al Arbour]] persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, figuring it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.<ref name=\"Champions\">{{cite book |title=Champions:  The Illustrated History of Hockey's Greatest Dynasties |last=Hunter |first=Douglas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=Triumph Books |location=[[Chicago]] |isbn=1-57243-213-6}}</ref> Bossy was placed on a line with [[Bryan Trottier]] and [[Clark Gillies]], a combination that would come to be known as [[The Trio Grande]],<ref name=\"greatesthockeylegends.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greatesthockeylegends.com/2009/02/who-was-better-guy-lafleur-vs-mike.html |title=Who Was Better?

He made good on his promise, scoring a then-record 53 goals as a rookie in the 1977\u201378 season, won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] for rookie of the year, and was named a Second Team All-Star.\n\nMany thought it would be impossible to duplicate [[Maurice Richard]]'s 50 in 50, set thirty-six years earlier. Then, in the 1980\u201381 season, Bossy became only the second player to score [[50 goals in 50 games]]. This was hyped by the hockey press as he was in an unofficial competition with Charlie Simmer of the Los Angeles Kings to see who could first accomplish the 50 in 50 milestone since Richard. Both players were involved in their 50th game, with Simmer at 46 and Bossy at 48, with Simmer getting a hat trick to bring his total to 49 goals in 50. Making it particularly dramatic, Bossy was scoreless for much of the game but found the net twice within the last five minutes of his 50th game. Richard was on hand to congratulate Bossy for this achievement. Bossy finished the season with 68 goals in 79 games.\n\nBossy was known for being able to score goals in remarkable fashion, the most incredible, perhaps, in the [[1982 Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Vancouver Canucks]] when, up-ended by a check from [[Tiger Williams]] and flying several feet in the air, parallel to the ice, Bossy nonetheless managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy was also noted for his clean play, never resorting to fighting (and being one of the first players to speak out against violence on the ice), and winning the [[Lady Byng Trophy]] for gentlemanly play three times: 1983, 1984, and 1986.\n\nBossy has harboured some animosity towards [[Wayne Gretzky]] and the [[Edmonton Oilers]], stating that the Islanders got little recognition for their dynasty (1980\u201383) compared to the Canadiens (1976\u201379) or Oilers (1984\u201385\n). Bossy complained \"I do a lot of promoting for how good [the Islanders] were...We never got one millionth of the recognition we should. We had a very low-key organization. They didn't want guys doing too much, because they thought the hockey might suffer. People don't talk about us in the first mention of great teams.\" <ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/magazine/where.bossy/ |title=SI.com&nbsp;\u2014 Magazine&nbsp;\u2014 Where Are They Now?

(They nearly did; in the [[1977 WHA Amateur Draft]], Bossy was selected by the [[Indianapolis Racers]], who one year later would become Gretzky's first pro team.) Bossy's response in the Post was not complimentary, as he pointed out that their playing styles were different, and also said that Trottier was the best centre in hockey.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyislanderslegends.blogspot.com/2006/09/bryan-trottier.html |title=New York Islanders Legends: Bryan Trottier |publisher=Nyislanderslegends.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-26 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> Gretzky did not comment on that at the time; however, years later in his autobiography he reiterated that Bossy was a great player, but \"I sure wouldn't want to ride in a cab with that guy.\"\n\nIn 1982, Bossy set a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points while also winning the [[Stanley Cup]] and [[Conn Smythe Trophy]]. However, far more attention was given to Gretzky who not only won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] and [[Art Ross Trophy]], but also shattered scoring records with an unheard of 212 points and 92 goals. Bossy aspired to be the best player of his era but fell short, as the Hart and Art Ross Trophies were two of the awards that eluded Bossy during his career, going to [[Guy Lafleur]], Trottier, and Gretzky.<ref name=\"greatesthockeylegends.com\"/><ref name=\"HHOF Legends\">{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199101&type=Player&page=bio&list=|work=Legends of Hockey - Mike Bossy|publisher=Hockey Hall Of Fame|accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref> Although the Islanders swept the Oilers in the 1983 final to win a fourth consecutive championship, Gretzky and his Oilers still received the most attention.<ref>{{cite web|author=E.M.

Bossy, who had scored 8 goals after the first three rounds of the playoffs (and 17 goals in the past three consecutive post-seasons), was silenced completely in the finals series.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Falla |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122112/index.htm |title=An era ended as Edmonton's Oilers wrested the Stanley Cup - 05.28.84 - SI Vault |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1984-05-28 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the Islanders slowly declined, while injuries took their toll on Bossy's back. He was limited to 63 games in the 1986\u201387 season but still managed to score 38 goals. He decided to take the next season off to rest his back, but officially retired after the 1987-88 season. During his season off, Bill Torrey had offered Bossy to be traded to the Montreal Canadiens, so he could be closer to home, but Bossy declined. Having played his last game at the young age of 30, he scored 573 goals and 553 assists in 752 NHL games, all with the Islanders.<ref name=NYT1>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDC1E3AF936A15753C1A96E948260 |title=Bossy's Desire to Play Defeated by Pain |publisher=New York Times |date=1988-10-25 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Islanders retired Bossy's #22 on March 3, 1992, the second Islander afforded that honour after longtime teammate [[Denis Potvin]].<ref name=NYT1/>\n\n==Career after hockey==\nBossy hoped to go to training camp in the fall of 1987, but no medical therapy had changed his condition. He then took the 1987-88 season off to try different treatments for his back. Nothing worked, and no one could figure out what exactly was wrong. Though only thirty-one years old, Bossy was forced to officially retire in October 1988. After his playing days were over, he was unable to play hockey or even work out because of his back and knees.\n\nAfter his retirement, Bossy returned to Laval, in the suburbs of Montreal, with wife Lucie and two daughters, Josiane and Tanya. His first post-hockey project involved going into business with Pierre La Croix, his agent, and working at Titan, a hockey stick manufacturer, as vice-president. He was also a broadcaster for the Quebec Nordiques. By the early 1990s, he represented Karhu, another stick manufacturer, and Cumis, an insurance agency, in public relations positions. He also played golf and gave speeches. In 1993, Bossy broke into radio, and by 1994, he had a regular job on early morning talk radio in Quebec. There he displayed his comic abilities until he left in 1996. By 1999, Bossy was doing public relations for Humpty Dumpty potato chips and other firms. He also remained connected to hockey by serving as the ambassador for Chevrolet Safe & Fun Hockey.\n\nAt the end of his shortened playing career, Bossy had impressive numbers. He scored 573 goals and 553 assists in only 752 games. In 129 playoff games, he had eighty-five goals and seventy-five assists. When he retired, he held the record for most goals per season average with 57.3. While he wanted to be considered a great overall player, he was basically known for his impressive scoring output. Even he did not completely understand how he did it. As he was quoted as saying by Stan Fischler in ''The All-New Hockey's 100,'' \"About 90 percent of the time I don't aim: I just try to get my shot away as quick as possible as a surprise element. I just try to get the puck on net.\"\n\nHe afterwards recalled not being able to get a job with an NHL organization for over a decade and a half. \"I called the Canadiens at least two or three times [in the mid-1990s] because I thought I could help the organization in some way, not necessarily as a coach but in some role that could be developed,\" Bossy told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 2005.  \"They never called back.\" When former linemate [[Bryan Trottier]] was hired as [[New York Rangers]] coach in 2002, Bossy was certain Trottier would hire him on in some capacity. \"The reason was,\" Bossy said, \"I remember having umpteen conversations with Bryan, having roomed with him for 10 years, that went, 'One of these days, Mike, we're going to take a team and do it our way.' I've found out since from Bryan [who was fired in his first season] that he wasn't going to be given that chance.\"\n<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\" /> Bossy then did a three-year stint as part of the morning zoo crew on CKOI, a French-language radio station in Montreal. When he started out doing promotional work for [[Humpty Dumpty Snack Foods|Humpty Dumpty]] in the late 90s, he then became the Quebec sales director of the company in 2003.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\" />\n\nIn 2005, Bossy made a cameo appearance on the fourth sequel to the French Canadian classic movie ''[[Les Boys]]'', playing himself.\n\nOn October 13, 2006, the Islanders held a news conference to announce that Bossy had rejoined the organization, working with the front office in sponsor and fan development.<ref name=MSG>{{cite web|title=Hall of Famer Mike Bossy Joins MSG Networks As Hockey Analyst|url=http://www.msgnetworks.com/msg-news/hall-of-famer-mike-bossy-joins-msg-networks-as-hockey-analyst.html|publisher=MSG|accessdate=18 November 2015|date=9 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118205209/http://www.msgnetworks.com/msg-news/hall-of-famer-mike-bossy-joins-msg-networks-as-hockey-analyst.html|archivedate=18 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, Bossy joined [[MSG (TV channel)|MSG Networks]] as a hockey analyst,<ref name=MSG /> and in September 2015, he officially joined [[TVA Sports]],  the official French-language broadcaster of the NHL in Canada, as a colour commentator. Bossy appears on the late night show ''Dave Morissette Live'' and ''TVA Sports at 5''.\n\nBossy served as a consultant for ''[[The Raccoons on Ice]]'', a hockey-themed special episode of the animated TV series ''[[The Raccoons]]'' first released in 1981. For most of the episode, the character Cedric Sneer is seen wearing a New York Islanders jersey with the number 22, as an homage to Bossy.<ref>The jersey can be seen at 2:34. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Wi6kH41Uo</ref>\n\n==Accomplishments==\nAs of 2018, Bossy holds or shares the following NHL records:\n* Most consecutive 50+ goal seasons: 9\n* Most 50+ goal seasons (not necessarily consecutive): 9 (tied with Wayne Gretzky)\n* Most 60+ goal seasons (not necessarily consecutive): 5 (tied with Wayne Gretzky)\n* Highest goals-per-game average, career (minimum 200 total goals): .762 goals per game\n* Most power-play goals, one playoff season: 9 (tied with [[Cam Neely]])\n* Most consecutive hat tricks: 3 (tied with [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]], who accomplished this twice)\n* In January, 2017, Bossy was part of the second group of players to be named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.<ref name=\"100 Greatest NHL Players\"/>\n\nBossy won the following major NHL awards:\n* [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] (rookie of the year), 1978\n* [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] (playoff MVP), 1982\n* [[Lady Byng Trophy]] (player best combining a high skill level with gentlemanly play), three times (1983, 1984, 1986)\n* First Team All-Star, five times\nHe also led the league in goals twice, in 1978-79 and 1980-81 (both predate the [[Rocket Richard Trophy]]). \n\nBossy was a part of all four [[Stanley Cup]]-winning New York Islanders teams (1979-80, 1980-81, 1981-82, 1982-83).\n\nHere is a selected list of other official NHL record categories where Bossy was once the record-holder and/or is ranked very highly:\n* Goals, career: 21st all-time with 573; only Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky reached 500 in fewer games\n* Goals, regular season and playoffs combined, one season:  seventh all-time with 85 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* Assists by a right wing, one season: second all-time with 83 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* Points by a right wing, one season: second all time with 147 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* Goals by a rookie, one season: second all-time with 53 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* 100+ point seasons, career: fourth all-time with 7\n* Goals per game, playoffs, career: Second all-time with .659\n* Goals per game, regular season and playoffs combined, career: Second all-time with .747\n* Points per game, career: third all-time\n* Assists per game, career: eighteenth all-time\n* Shooting percentage, career: fourth all-time with 21.18%\n* Hat tricks, one season: tied for third all-time with 9 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* Hat tricks, career: third all-time with 39\n\nBossy has several significant career achievements that are not official NHL records. He reached 100 career goals faster (in terms of career games played) than any other player in modern NHL history, requiring just 129 games to accomplish this. ([[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]]-61, [[Newsy Lalonde]]-69, [[Cy Denneny]]-86, [[Babe Dye]]-86, [[Reg Noble]]-109 & [[Frank Nighbor]]-125 had previously scored 100 goals in fewer games.) He was also the fastest to various other milestones such as 200 (255 GP), 300 (381 GP), 400 (506 GP) and 500 (647 GP) goals at the time he achieved them, but currently ranks behind [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Mario Lemieux]] in most of these categories. In the 1980\u201381 NHL season, he scored [[50 goals in 50 games|50 goals in the first 50 games of the season]] - only the second player, and the first in almost 40 years, to achieve this. He remains one of only five players who can claim to have accomplished this. He is the only player to score 17 goals in three consecutive playoff years.\n\nBossy was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1991. His #22 sweater was retired by the Islanders on March 3, 1992.  In 1998, he was ranked number 20 on ''[[The Hockey News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Regular season and playoffs===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" ID=\"Table3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff;\"| &nbsp;\n! rowspan=\"99\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff;\"| &nbsp;\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"5\"| [[Regular season|Regular&nbsp;season]]\n! rowspan=\"99\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff;\"| &nbsp;\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"5\"| [[Playoffs]]\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e0e0e0;\"\n!

Among many other remarkable achievements, he was the only player in NHL history to score consecutive Stanley Cup winning goals (1982 and 1983) and the only player to record four game-winning goals in one series (1983 Conference Final). He is the NHL's all-time leader in average goals scored per regular season game, holds the NHL's third highest all-time average points scored per regular season game, and is one of only five players to score [[50 goals in 50 games]]. In 2017 Bossy was named one of the '[[100 Greatest NHL Players]]' in history.<ref name=\"100 Greatest NHL Players\">{{cite web|title=100 Greatest NHL Players|url=https://www.nhl.com/fans/nhl-centennial/100-greatest-nhl-players|website=NHL.com|accessdate=January 27, 2017|date=January 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nAs a youth, Bossy played in the 1969 [[Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament]] with a [[minor ice hockey]] team from [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publicationsports.com/ressources/files/439/Joueurs_Pro.pdf|title=Pee-Wee players who have reached NHL or WHA|year=2018|website=Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> He started his junior career with [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] at the age of 15. Despite scoring 309 goals in four seasons, he was considered a timid player by NHL scouts.\n\nIn the [[1977 NHL Amateur Draft]], he was passed over by twelve teams, with the [[New York Rangers]] and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] ignoring him twice. However, the New York Islanders made him their first choice, 15th overall. General manager [[Bill Torrey]] was torn at first between taking Bossy and [[Dwight Foster (ice hockey)|Dwight Foster]].  Bossy was known as a scorer who could not check, while Foster could check but was inferior offensively.

He made good on his promise, scoring a then-record 53 goals as a rookie in the 1977\u201378 season, won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] for rookie of the year, and was named a Second Team All-Star.\n\nMany thought it would be impossible to duplicate [[Maurice Richard]]'s 50 in 50, set thirty-six years earlier. Then, in the 1980\u201381 season, Bossy became only the second player to score [[50 goals in 50 games]]. This was hyped by the hockey press as he was in an unofficial competition with Charlie Simmer of the Los Angeles Kings to see who could first accomplish the 50 in 50 milestone since Richard. Both players were involved in their 50th game, with Simmer at 46 and Bossy at 48, with Simmer getting a hat trick to bring his total to 49 goals in 50. Making it particularly dramatic, Bossy was scoreless for much of the game but found the net twice within the last five minutes of his 50th game. Richard was on hand to congratulate Bossy for this achievement. Bossy finished the season with 68 goals in 79 games.\n\nBossy was known for being able to score goals in remarkable fashion, the most incredible, perhaps, in the [[1982 Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Vancouver Canucks]] when, up-ended by a check from [[Tiger Williams]] and flying several feet in the air, parallel to the ice, Bossy nonetheless managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy was also noted for his clean play, never resorting to fighting (and being one of the first players to speak out against violence on the ice), and winning the [[Lady Byng Trophy]] for gentlemanly play three times: 1983, 1984, and 1986.\n\nBossy has harboured some animosity towards [[Wayne Gretzky]] and the [[Edmonton Oilers]], stating that the Islanders got little recognition for their dynasty (1980\u201383) compared to the Canadiens (1976\u201379) or Oilers (1984\u201390). Bossy complained \"I do a lot of promoting for how good [the Islanders] were...We never got one millionth of the recognition we should. We had a very low-key organization. They didn't want guys doing too much, because they thought the hockey might suffer. People don't talk about us in the first mention of great teams.\" <ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/magazine/where.bossy/ |title=SI.com&nbsp;\u2014 Magazine&nbsp;\u2014 Where Are They Now?

(They nearly did; in the [[1977 WHA Amateur Draft]], Bossy was selected by the [[Indianapolis Racers]], who one year later would become Gretzky's first pro team.) Bossy's response in the Post was not complimentary, as he pointed out that their playing styles were different, and also said that Trottier was the best centre in hockey.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyislanderslegends.blogspot.com/2006/09/bryan-trottier.html |title=New York Islanders Legends: Bryan Trottier |publisher=Nyislanderslegends.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-26 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> Gretzky did not comment on that at the time; however, years later in his autobiography he reiterated that Bossy was a great player, but \"I sure wouldn't want to ride in a cab with that guy.\"\n\nIn 1982, Bossy set a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points while also winning the [[Stanley Cup]] and [[Conn Smythe Trophy]]. However, far more attention was given to Gretzky who not only won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] and [[Art Ross Trophy]], but also shattered scoring records with an unheard of 212 points and 92 goals. Bossy aspired to be the best player of his era but fell short, as the Hart and Art Ross Trophies were two of the awards that eluded Bossy during his career, going to [[Guy Lafleur]], Trottier, and Gretzky.<ref name=\"greatesthockeylegends.com\"/><ref name=\"HHOF Legends\">{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199101&type=Player&page=bio&list=|work=Legends of Hockey - Mike Bossy|publisher=Hockey Hall Of Fame|accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref> Although the Islanders swept the Oilers in the 1983 final to win a fourth consecutive championship, Gretzky and his Oilers still received the most attention.<ref>{{cite web|author=E.M.

Bossy, who had scored 8 goals after the first three rounds of the playoffs (and 17 goals in the past three consecutive post-seasons), was silenced completely in the finals series.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Falla |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122112/index.htm |title=An era ended as Edmonton's Oilers wrested the Stanley Cup - 05.28.84 - SI Vault |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1984-05-28 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the Islanders slowly declined, while injuries took their toll on Bossy's back. He was limited to 63 games in the 1986\u201387 season but still managed to score 38 goals. He decided to take the next season off to rest his back, but officially retired after the 1987-88 season. During his season off, Bill Torrey had offered Bossy to be traded to the Montreal Canadiens, so he could be closer to home, but Bossy declined. Having played his last game at the young age of 30, he scored 573 goals and 553 assists in 752 NHL games, all with the Islanders.<ref name=NYT1>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDC1E3AF936A15753C1A96E948260 |title=Bossy's Desire to Play Defeated by Pain |publisher=New York Times |date=1988-10-25 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Islanders retired Bossy's #22 on March 3, 1992, the second Islander afforded that honour after longtime teammate [[Denis Potvin]].<ref name=NYT1/>\n\n==Career after hockey==\nBossy hoped to go to training camp in the fall of 1987, but no medical therapy had changed his condition. He then took the 1987-88 season off to try different treatments for his back. Nothing worked, and no one could figure out what exactly was wrong. Though only thirty-one years old, Bossy was forced to officially retire in October 1988. After his playing days were over, he was unable to play hockey or even work out because of his back and knees.\n\nAfter his retirement, Bossy returned to Laval, in the suburbs of Montreal, with wife Lucie and two daughters, Josiane and Tanya. His first post-hockey project involved going into business with Pierre La Croix, his agent, and working at Titan, a hockey stick manufacturer, as vice-president. He was also a broadcaster for the Quebec Nordiques. By the early 1990s, he represented Karhu, another stick manufacturer, and Cumis, an insurance agency, in public relations positions. He also played golf and gave speeches. In 1993, Bossy broke into radio, and by 1994, he had a regular job on early morning talk radio in Quebec. There he displayed his comic abilities until he left in 1996. By 1999, Bossy was doing public relations for Humpty Dumpty potato chips and other firms. He also remained connected to hockey by serving as the ambassador for Chevrolet Safe & Fun Hockey.\n\nAt the end of his shortened playing career, Bossy had impressive numbers. He scored 573 goals and 553 assists in only 752 games. In 129 playoff games, he had eighty-five goals and seventy-five assists. When he retired, he held the record for most goals per season average with 57.3. While he wanted to be considered a great overall player, he was basically known for his impressive scoring output. Even he did not completely understand how he did it. As he was quoted as saying by Stan Fischler in ''The All-New Hockey's 100,'' \"About 90 percent of the time I don't aim: I just try to get my shot away as quick as possible as a surprise element. I just try to get the puck on net.\"\n\nHe afterwards recalled not being able to get a job with an NHL organization for over a decade and a half. \"I called the Canadiens at least two or three times [in the mid-1990s] because I thought I could help the organization in some way, not necessarily as a coach but in some role that could be developed,\" Bossy told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 2005.  \"They never called back.\" When former linemate [[Bryan Trottier]] was hired as [[New York Rangers]] coach in 2002, Bossy was certain Trottier would hire him on in some capacity. \"The reason was,\" Bossy said, \"I remember having umpteen conversations with Bryan, having roomed with him for 10 years, that went, 'One of these days, Mike, we're going to take a team and do it our way.' I've found out since from Bryan [who was fired in his first season] that he wasn't going to be given that chance.\"\n<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\" /> Bossy then did a three-year stint as part of the morning zoo crew on CKOI, a French-language radio station in Montreal. When he started out doing promotional work for [[Humpty Dumpty Snack Foods|Humpty Dumpty]] in the late 90s, he then became the Quebec sales director of the company in 2003.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\" />\n\nIn 2005, Bossy made a cameo appearance on the fourth sequel to the French Canadian classic movie ''[[Les Boys]]'', playing himself.\n\nOn October 13, 2006, the Islanders held a news conference to announce that Bossy had rejoined the organization, working with the front office in sponsor and fan development.<ref name=MSG>{{cite web|title=Hall of Famer Mike Bossy Joins MSG Networks As Hockey Analyst|url=http://www.msgnetworks.com/msg-news/hall-of-famer-mike-bossy-joins-msg-networks-as-hockey-analyst.html|publisher=MSG|accessdate=18 November 2015|date=9 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118205209/http://www.msgnetworks.com/msg-news/hall-of-famer-mike-bossy-joins-msg-networks-as-hockey-analyst.html|archivedate=18 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, Bossy joined [[MSG (TV channel)|MSG Networks]] as a hockey analyst,<ref name=MSG /> and in September 2015, he officially joined [[TVA Sports]],  the official French-language broadcaster of the NHL in Canada, as a colour commentator. Bossy appears on the late night show ''Dave Morissette Live'' and ''TVA Sports at 5''.\n\nBossy served as a consultant for ''[[The Raccoons on Ice]]'', a hockey-themed special episode of the animated TV series ''[[The Raccoons]]'' first released in 1981. For most of the episode, the character Cedric Sneer is seen wearing a New York Islanders jersey with the number 22, as an homage to Bossy.<ref>The jersey can be seen at 2:34. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Wi6kH41Uo</ref>\n\n==Accomplishments==\nAs of 2018, Bossy holds or shares the following NHL records:\n* Most consecutive 50+ goal seasons: 9\n* Most 50+ goal seasons (not necessarily consecutive): 9 (tied with Wayne Gretzky)\n* Most 60+ goal seasons (not necessarily consecutive): 5 (tied with Wayne Gretzky)\n* Highest goals-per-game average, career (minimum 200 total goals): .762 goals per game\n* Most power-play goals, one playoff season: 9 (tied with [[Cam Neely]])\n* Most consecutive hat tricks: 3 (tied with [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]], who accomplished this twice)\n* In January, 2017, Bossy was part of the second group of players to be named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.<ref name=\"100 Greatest NHL Players\"/>\n\nBossy won the following major NHL awards:\n* [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] (rookie of the year), 1978\n* [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] (playoff MVP), 1982\n* [[Lady Byng Trophy]] (player best combining a high skill level with gentlemanly play), three times (1983, 1984, 1986)\n* First Team All-Star, five times\nHe also led the league in goals twice, in 1978-79 and 1980-81 (both predate the [[Rocket Richard Trophy]]). \n\nBossy was a part of all four [[Stanley Cup]]-winning New York Islanders teams (1979-80, 1980-81, 1981-82, 1982-83).\n\nHere is a selected list of other official NHL record categories where Bossy was once the record-holder and/or is ranked very highly:\n* Goals, career: 21st all-time with 573; only Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky reached 500 in fewer games\n* Goals, regular season and playoffs combined, one season:  seventh all-time with 85 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* Assists by a right wing, one season: second all-time with 83 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* Points by a right wing, one season: second all time with 147 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* Goals by a rookie, one season: second all-time with 53 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* 100+ point seasons, career: fourth all-time with 7\n* Goals per game, playoffs, career: Second all-time with .659\n* Goals per game, regular season and playoffs combined, career: Second all-time with .747\n* Points per game, career: third all-time\n* Assists per game, career: eighteenth all-time\n* Shooting percentage, career: fourth all-time with 21.18%\n* Hat tricks, one season: tied for third all-time with 9 (was a record at the time it was achieved)\n* Hat tricks, career: third all-time with 39\n\nBossy has several significant career achievements that are not official NHL records. He reached 100 career goals faster (in terms of career games played) than any other player in modern NHL history, requiring just 129 games to accomplish this. ([[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]]-61, [[Newsy Lalonde]]-69, [[Cy Denneny]]-86, [[Babe Dye]]-86, [[Reg Noble]]-109 & [[Frank Nighbor]]-125 had previously scored 100 goals in fewer games.) He was also the fastest to various other milestones such as 200 (255 GP), 300 (381 GP), 400 (506 GP) and 500 (647 GP) goals at the time he achieved them, but currently ranks behind [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Mario Lemieux]] in most of these categories. In the 1980\u201381 NHL season, he scored [[50 goals in 50 games|50 goals in the first 50 games of the season]] - only the second player, and the first in almost 40 years, to achieve this. He remains one of only five players who can claim to have accomplished this. He is the only player to score 17 goals in three consecutive playoff years.\n\nBossy was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1991. His #22 sweater was retired by the Islanders on March 3, 1992.  In 1998, he was ranked number 20 on ''[[The Hockey News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Regular season and playoffs===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" ID=\"Table3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff;\"| &nbsp;\n! rowspan=\"99\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff;\"| &nbsp;\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"5\"| [[Regular season|Regular&nbsp;season]]\n! rowspan=\"99\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff;\"| &nbsp;\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"5\"| [[Playoffs]]\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e0e0e0;\"\n!
