It began to be socially and politically accepted and legislated during the late 19th century, beginning with [[South Australia]] in 1894 and [[Western Australia]] in 1899. In 1902, the newly established [[Australian Parliament]] passed the ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'', which set a uniform law enabling women (except those who were \"aboriginal natives\" of Australia, Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands, unless excepted under [[Section 41 of the Constitution of Australia|section 41 of the constitution]]) to vote at federal elections and to stand for the federal Parliament. This removed gender discrimination in relation to electoral rights for federal elections in Australia. By 1911, the remaining [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] had legislated for [[women's suffrage]] for state elections. It took longer before women could stand for parliament throughout Australia and even longer before they were actually elected.\n\n==History==\n===Pre-19th century experiences===\nPost-colonization, [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] society has been governed by councils of elders and a corporate decision-making process.\n\nThe female descendants of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Bounty mutineers]] who lived on [[Pitcairn Islands]] could vote from 1838, and this right transferred with their resettlement to [[Norfolk Island]] (now an [[States and territories of Australia|Australian external territory]]) in 1856.<ref>{{cite web |author=EC |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html |title=Votes for Women &#124; Elections New Zealand |publisher=Elections.org.nz |date=13 April 2005 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819080640/http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html |archivedate=19 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Male suffrage===\nThe first European-style governments established after 1788 were [[autocratic]] and run by appointed [[Governors of New South Wales|governors]] \u2013 although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights&nbsp;1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists.

Recently some of these petitions have been transcribed and can be searched digitally.\n\n=== Towards voting rights ===\nThe first election for the Parliament of the newly formed [[Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901 was based on the electoral laws of the six federating colonies, so that women who had the vote and the right to stand for Parliament at a colony (now state) level (i.e., in South Australia including the Northern Territory and Western Australia) had the same rights for the 1901 Australian federal election. In 1902, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the uniform ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'', which enabled women 21 years of age and older to vote at elections for the federal Parliament. The States soon gave women over 21 the vote: [[New South Wales]] in 1902, [[Tasmania]] in 1903, [[Queensland]] in 1905, and [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] in 1908.\n\nHowever, this franchise was excluded from women (and men) who were \"aboriginal natives\" of Australia, Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands, unless excepted under [[Section 41 of the Constitution of Australia|section 41 of the constitution]]. Most did not get the vote for federal elections until 1962, and in all States until 1967.

In 1902, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the uniform ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902]]'', which enabled women 21 years of age and older to vote at elections for the federal Parliament. The States soon gave women over 21 the vote: [[New South Wales]] in 1902, [[Tasmania]] in 1903, [[Queensland]] in 1905, and [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] in 1908.\n\nHowever, this franchise was excluded from women (and men) who were \"aboriginal natives\" of Australia, Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands, unless excepted under [[Section 41 of the Constitution of Australia|section 41 of the constitution]].

[[Eva Seery]] contested Labor Party preselection for the Senate in 1916 but was unsuccessful. She and [[Henrietta Greville]] were endorsed [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] candidates at the [[1917 Australian federal election|1917 federal election]], though for safe conservative seats. Though unsuccessful they were the first women to stand for the Australian Parliament with major party endorsement.\n\nThe first woman elected to any Australian Parliament was [[Edith Cowan]], elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly in 1921.
