A state of [[total war]] emerged, directly involving more than 100&nbsp;million people from more than 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the [[war effort]], blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War{{nbsp}}II was the [[List of wars by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in human history, marked by [[World War II casualties|70 to 85 million fatalities]], most of whom were civilians in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]].

World War{{nbsp}}II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of [[military campaign|campaigns]] and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental [[Europe]], and formed the Axis alliance with [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and Japan. Under the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. Following the onset of campaigns in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]], and the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the [[British Empire]]. War in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], and the long [[Battle of the Atlantic]] followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] trapped the Axis, most crucially the German [[Wehrmacht]], in a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|launched a surprise attack]] on the [[United States]] as well as [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European colonies]] in the Pacific. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by some in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.\n\nThe Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]]; later, Germany and Italy were [[Second Battle of El Alamein|defeated in North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasions of Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia, in [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]], [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany by the Western Allies]] and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of Adolf Hitler]] and the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6{{nbsp}}and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by the Allies, and [[war crimes]] trials were conducted in the wake of the war both [[Nuremberg Trials|against the Germans]] and [[Japanese war crimes#War crimes trials|against the Japanese]].\n\nWorld War&nbsp;II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious [[great power]]s\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long [[Cold War]]. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the [[decolonisation of Africa]] and [[Decolonisation of Asia|Asia]]. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion|economic recovery and expansion]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Chronology ==\n{{See also|Timeline of World War II}}\n{{WWII timeline}}\nThe start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939,{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=6}}<ref>Wells, Anne Sharp (2014) ''Historical Dictionary of World War II: The War against Germany and Italy''.

Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, V\u00f6lkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.\n\nDespite strong [[pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War{{nbsp}}I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&pg=PA76 76\u201378]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}\n\nThe German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a \"[[New Roman Empire]]\".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}\n\n[[File:N\u00fcrnberg Reichsparteitag Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Nuremberg]], August 1933]]\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|became the Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933.

The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.</ref> The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}\n\nHitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising the Rhineland]] in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome\u2013Berlin Axis]].

Following the onset of campaigns in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]], and the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the [[British Empire]]. War in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], and the long [[Battle of the Atlantic]] followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] trapped the Axis, most crucially the German [[Wehrmacht]], in a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|launched a surprise attack]] on the [[United States]] as well as [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European colonies]] in the Pacific. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by some in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.\n\nThe Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]]; later, Germany and Italy were [[Second Battle of El Alamein|defeated in North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasions of Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia, in [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]], [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany by the Western Allies]] and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of Adolf Hitler]] and the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6{{nbsp}}and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by the Allies, and [[war crimes]] trials were conducted in the wake of the war both [[Nuremberg Trials|against the Germans]] and [[Japanese war crimes#War crimes trials|against the Japanese]].\n\nWorld War&nbsp;II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious [[great power]]s\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the nearly half-century long [[Cold War]]. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the [[decolonisation of Africa]] and [[Decolonisation of Asia|Asia]]. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion|economic recovery and expansion]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Chronology ==\n{{See also|Timeline of World War II}}\n{{WWII timeline}}\nThe start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939,{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=6}}<ref>Wells, Anne Sharp (2014) ''Historical Dictionary of World War II: The War against Germany and Italy''.

Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Greece, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, V\u00f6lkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.\n\nDespite strong [[pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War{{nbsp}}I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&pg=PA76 76\u201378]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}\n\nThe German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a \"[[New Roman Empire]]\".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}\n\n[[File:N\u00fcrnberg Reichsparteitag Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Nuremberg]], August 1933]]\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|became the Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933.

The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.</ref> The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}\n\nHitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising the Rhineland]] in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome\u2013Berlin Axis]].
