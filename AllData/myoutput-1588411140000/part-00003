Subsequently, he attended [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]], where he studied with [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Darius Milhaud]] (1961\u20131963) and earned a master's degree in composition. At Mills, Reich composed ''Melodica'' for [[melodica]] and [[tape recorder|tape]], which appeared in 1986 on the three-LP release ''Music from Mills''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r202182|pure_url=yes}} Music from Mills] at [[AllMusic]]</ref>\n\nReich worked with the [[San Francisco Tape Music Center]] along with [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Ramon Sender]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Phil Lesh]] and [[Terry Riley]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=David|title=The San Francisco Tape Music Center|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24892-2}}</ref> He was involved with the premiere of Riley's ''[[In C]]'' and suggested the use of the eighth note pulse, which is now standard in performance of the piece.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1960s ===\n\nReich's early forays into composition involved experimentation with [[twelve-tone composition]], but he found the rhythmic aspects of the number twelve more interesting than the pitch aspects.<ref>Malcolm Ball [http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/malcolmball/reich.htm on Steve Reich] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903103635/http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/malcolmball/reich.htm |date=September 3, 2018 }}</ref> Reich also composed film soundtracks for ''Plastic Haircut'' (1963), ''Oh Dem Watermelons'' (1965), and ''Thick Pucker'' (1965), three films by [[Robert Nelson (filmmaker)|Robert Nelson]]. The soundtrack of ''Plastic Haircut'', composed in 1963, was a short tape collage, possibly Reich's first. The ''Watermelons'' soundtrack used two 19th-century [[minstrel show|minstrel tunes]] as its basis, and used repeated phrasing together in a large five-part [[canon (music)|canon]]. The music for ''Thick Pucker'' arose from street recordings Reich made walking around San Francisco with Nelson, who filmed in black and white 16mm. This film no longer survives. A fourth film from 1965, about 25 minutes long and tentatively entitled \"Thick Pucker II\", was assembled by Nelson from outtakes of that shoot and more of the raw audio Reich had recorded. Nelson was not happy with the resulting film and never showed it. His name was actually henry\n\nReich was influenced by fellow minimalist Terry Riley, whose work ''[[In C]]'' combines simple musical patterns, offset in time, to create a slowly shifting, cohesive whole. Reich adopted this approach to compose his first major work, ''It's Gonna Rain''. Composed in 1965, the piece used a fragment of a [[sermon]] about the end of the world given by a black [[Pentecostal]] street-preacher known as Brother Walter. Reich built on his early tape work, transferring the last three words of the fragment, \"it's gonna rain!\", to multiple tape loops which gradually move out of phase with one another.\n\nThe 13-minute ''Come Out'' (1966) uses similarly manipulated recordings of a single spoken line given by Daniel Hamm, one of the falsely accused [[Harlem Six]], who was severely injured by police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Occupied-Territory-Baldwin1966.htm|title=A Report from Occupied Territory|author=James Baldwin|publisher=mindfully.org|date=July 11, 1966|accessdate=April 28, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629144022/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Occupied-Territory-Baldwin1966.htm|archivedate=June 29, 2013|author-link=James Baldwin}}</ref> The survivor, who had been beaten, punctured a bruise on his own body to convince police about his beating. The spoken line includes the phrase \"to let the bruise\u2019s blood come out to show them.\" Reich rerecorded the fragment \"come out to show them\" on two channels, which are initially played in unison. They quickly slip out of sync; gradually the discrepancy widens and becomes a reverberation. The two voices then split into four, looped continuously, then eight, and continues splitting until the actual words are unintelligible, leaving the listener with only the speech's rhythmic and tonal patterns. \n\n''Melodica'' (1966) takes the phase looping idea of his previous works and applies it to instrumental music. Steve Reich took a simple melody, which he played on a [[melodica]], then recorded it. He then sets the melody to two separate channels, and slowly moves them out of phase, creating an intricate interlocking melody. This piece is very similar to ''Come Out'' in rhythmic structure, and are an example of how one rhythmic process can be realized in different sounds to create two different pieces of music. Reich was inspired to compose this piece from a dream he had on May 22, 1966, and put the piece together in one day. ''Melodica'' was the last piece Reich composed solely for tape, and he considers it his transition from tape music to instrumental music.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings on Music, 1965\u20132000|last=Reich|first=Steve|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-511171-0|location=New York|pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nReich's first attempt at translating this phasing technique from recorded tape to live performance was the 1967 ''[[Piano Phase]]'', for two pianos. In ''Piano Phase'' the performers repeat a rapid twelve-note [[melody|melodic]] figure, initially in unison. As one player keeps tempo with robotic precision, the other speeds up very slightly until the two parts line up again, but one sixteenth note apart. The second player then resumes the previous tempo. This cycle of speeding up and then locking in continues throughout the piece; the cycle comes full circle three times, the second and third cycles using shorter versions of the initial figure. ''Violin Phase'', also written in 1967, is built on these same lines. ''Piano Phase'' and ''Violin Phase'' both premiered in a series of concerts given in New York art galleries.\n\nA similar, lesser known example of this so-called [[process music]] is ''Pendulum Music'' (1968), which consists of the sound of several microphones swinging over the loudspeakers to which they are attached, producing [[feedback]] as they do so. \"Pendulum Music\" has never been recorded by Reich himself, but was introduced to rock audiences by [[Sonic Youth]] in the late 1990s.\n\nReich also tried to create the phasing effect in a piece \"that would need no instrument beyond the human body\". He found that the idea of phasing was inappropriate for the simple ways he was experimenting to make sound. Instead, he composed ''[[Clapping Music]]'' (1972), in which the players do not phase in and out with each other, but instead one performer keeps one line of a 12-eighth-note-long (12-quaver-long) phrase and the other performer shifts by one [[eighth note]] beat every 12 bars, until both performers are back in unison 144 bars later.<ref>{{cite book|title=Writings on Music, 1965-2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tMgpu5gSIOMC&pg=PR13&dq=steve+reich#v=onepage&q=steve%20reich&f=false|accessdate=February 28, 2018|isbn = 9780195111712|last1 = Reich|first1 = Steve|date = April 11, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe 1967 prototype piece ''[[Slow Motion Sound]]'' was not performed although [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]] performed it 27 years later as ''[[Slow Motion Blackbird]]'' on his Reich-influenced 1994 album ''[[Shift (Chris Hughes album)|Shift]]''. It introduced the idea of slowing down a recorded sound until many times its original length without changing pitch or timbre, which Reich applied to ''Four Organs'' (1970), which deals specifically with augmentation. The piece has [[maraca]]s playing a fast [[eighth note]] [[pulse (music)|pulse]], while the four organs stress certain eighth notes using an 11th chord. This work therefore dealt with [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and subtle rhythmic change. It is unique in the context of Reich's other pieces{{clarify|date=December 2016|post-text=How so \u2013 'unique'?}} in being linear as opposed to cyclic like his earlier works \u2013 the superficially similar ''[[Phase Patterns]]'', also for four organs but without maracas, is (as the name suggests) a phase piece similar to others composed during the period. ''Four Organs'' was performed as part of a [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] program, and was Reich's first composition to be performed in a large traditional setting.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\nIn 1970, Reich embarked on a five-week trip to study music in Ghana, during which he learned from the master drummer Gideon Alorwoyie. Reich also studied Balinese [[gamelan]] in [[Seattle]] in 1973 and 1974.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Reich Biography|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=when+did+steve+reich+study+chinese+bamelan+in+seattle&rlz=1CAHPZP_enUS786US786&safe=active&ssui=on|publisher=Steve Reich|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}</ref>{{When|date=May 2016}}<!--This was in the summer of 1972, but this is a personal recollection and, as such, Original Research.--> From his African experience, as well as [[A. M. Jones]]'s ''[[Studies in African Music]]'' about the [[Ewe music|music of the Ewe]] people, Reich drew inspiration for his 90-minute piece ''[[Drumming (Reich)|Drumming]]'', which he composed shortly after his return. Composed for a nine-piece percussion ensemble with female voices and [[piccolo]], ''Drumming'' marked the beginning of a new stage in his career, for around this time he formed his ensemble, [[Steve Reich and Musicians]], and increasingly concentrated on composition and performance with them. Steve Reich and Musicians, which was to be the sole ensemble to interpret his works for many years, still remains active with many of its original members.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter ''Drumming'', Reich moved on from the \"phase shifting\" technique that he had pioneered, and began writing more elaborate pieces. He investigated other musical processes such as [[augmentation (music)|augmentation]] (the temporal lengthening of phrases and melodic fragments). It was during this period that he wrote works such as ''[[Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ]]'' (1973) and ''[[Six Pianos]]'' (1973).\n\nIn 1974, Reich began writing ''[[Music for 18 Musicians]]''. This piece involved many new ideas, although it also hearkened back to earlier pieces. It is based on a [[cycle (music)|cycle]] of [[chord progression|eleven chords]] introduced at the beginning (called \"Pulses\"), followed by a small section of music based on each [[chord (music)|chord]] (\"Sections I-XI\"), and finally a return to the original cycle (\"Pulses\"). This was Reich's first attempt at writing for larger [[musical ensemble|ensembles]]. The increased number of performers resulted in more scope for psychoacoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to \"explore this idea further\". Reich remarked that this one work contained more harmonic movement in the first five minutes than any other work he had written. Steve Reich and Musicians made the premier recording of this work on [[ECM Records]].\n\nReich explored these ideas further in his frequently recorded pieces ''[[Music for a Large Ensemble]]'' (1978) and ''[[Octet (Reich)|Octet]]'' (1979). In these two works, Reich experimented with \"the human breath as the measure of musical duration ... the chords played by the trumpets are written to take one comfortable breath to perform\".<ref>Liner notes for ''Music for a Large Ensemble''</ref> Human voices are part of the musical palette in ''Music for a Large Ensemble'' but the wordless vocal parts simply form part of the texture (as they do in ''Drumming''). With ''Octet'' and his first orchestral piece ''[[Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards]]'' (also 1979), Reich's music showed the influence of Biblical [[cantillation]], which he had studied in [[Israel]] since the summer of 1977. After this, the human voice singing a text would play an increasingly important role in Reich's music.\n\n{{quote|The technique [...] consists of taking pre-existing melodic patterns and stringing them together to form a longer melody in the service of a holy text. If you take away the text, you're left with the idea of putting together small motives to make longer melodies \u2013 a technique I had not encountered before.<ref>Schwarz, K. Robert. ''Minimalists'', Phaidon Press, 1996, p.84 and p.86.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1974 Reich published the book ''Writings About Music'', containing essays on his philosophy, aesthetics, and musical projects written between 1963 and 1974. An updated and much more extensive collection, ''Writings On Music (1965\u20132000)'', was published in 2002.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nReich's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage. ''[[Tehillim (Reich)|Tehillim]]'' (1981), [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for ''[[psalm]]s'', is the first of Reich's works to draw explicitly on his Jewish background. The work is in four parts, and is scored for an ensemble of four women's voices (one high [[soprano]], two lyric sopranos and one [[alto]]), [[piccolo]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, six percussion (playing small tuned [[tambourine]]s without jingles, clapping, [[maraca]]s, [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]] and [[crotales]]), two [[electronic organ]]s, two violins, [[viola]], cello and [[double bass]], with amplified voices, strings, and winds. A setting of texts from Psalms 19:2\u20135 (19:1\u20134 in Christian translations), 34:13\u201315 (34:12\u201314), 18:26\u201327 (18:25\u201326), and 150:4\u20136, ''Tehillim'' is a departure from Reich's other work in its formal structure; the setting of texts several lines long rather than the fragments used in previous works makes melody a substantive element. Use of formal [[counterpoint]] and functional [[harmony]] also contrasts with the loosely structured minimalist works written previously.\n\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename   = Pat Metheny-Electric Counterpoint III Fast.ogg\n| title    = \"Electric Counterpoint III Fast\" (1989)\n| description = 25 seconds of \"Electric Counterpoint III Fast\" performed by Pat Metheny.

In ''Different Trains'', Reich compares and contrasts his childhood memories of his train journeys between New York and California in 1939\u20131941 with the very different trains being used to transport contemporaneous European children to their deaths under [[Nazism|Nazi]] rule. The [[Kronos Quartet]] recording of ''Different Trains'' was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition]] in 1990. The composition was described by [[Richard Taruskin]] as \"the only adequate musical response\u2014one of the few adequate artistic responses in any medium\u2014to [[the Holocaust]]\", and he credited the piece with earning Reich a place among the great composers of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D91F3FF937A1575BC0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |last=Taruskin |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |title=A Sturdy Musical Bridge to the 21st Century |work=The New York Times |date=August 24, 1997 |accessdate=September 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nIn 1993, Reich collaborated with his wife, the video artist [[Beryl Korot]], on an opera, ''[[The Cave (opera)|The Cave]]'', which explores the roots of Judaism, Christianity and Islam through the words of Israelis, [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], and Americans, echoed musically by the ensemble. The work, for percussion, voices, and strings, is a musical documentary, named for the [[Cave of Machpelah]] in [[Hebron]], where a mosque now stands and [[Abraham]] is said to have been buried.\n\nReich and Korot collaborated on the opera ''[[Three Tales (opera)|Three Tales]]'', which concerns the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]], the testing of [[nuclear weapon]]s on [[Bikini Atoll]], and other more modern concerns, specifically [[Dolly the sheep]], [[cloning]], and the [[technological singularity]].\n\nReich used sampling techniques for pieces like ''Three Tales'' and ''[[City Life (Reich)|City Life]]'' from 1994. Reich returned to composing purely instrumental works for the concert hall, starting with ''Triple Quartet'' in 1998 written for the Kronos Quartet that can either be performed by string quartet and tape, three string quartets or 36-piece string orchestra. According to Reich, the piece is influenced by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s and [[Alfred Schnittke]]'s string quartets, and [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]]'s ''Yo Shakespeare''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevereich.com/articles/NY-VT.html |title=From New York to Vermont: Conversation with Steve Reich |publisher=Stevereich.com |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe instrumental series for the concert hall continued with ''Dance Patterns'' (2002), ''[[Cello Counterpoint]]'' (2003), and sequence of works centered around Variations: ''You Are (Variations)'' (2004), a work which looks back to the vocal writing of works like ''Tehillim'' or ''The Desert Music'', ''[[Variations for Vibes, Pianos, and Strings]]'' in 2005, for the [[London Sinfonietta]] and ''Daniel Variations'' (2006).\n\nin 2002 Reich was invited by [[Walter Fink]] to the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]], as the 12th composer featured.\n\nIn an interview with ''The Guardian'', Reich stated that he continued to follow this direction with his piece ''Double Sextet'' (2007), which was commissioned by [[eighth blackbird]], an American ensemble consisting of the instrumental quintet (flute, clarinet, violin or viola, cello and piano) of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s piece ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' (1912) plus percussion.

Subsequently, he attended [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]], where he studied with [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Darius Milhaud]] (1961\u20131963) and earned a master's degree in composition. At Mills, Reich composed ''Melodica'' for [[melodica]] and [[tape recorder|tape]], which appeared in 1986 on the three-LP release ''Music from Mills''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r202182|pure_url=yes}} Music from Mills] at [[AllMusic]]</ref>\n\nReich worked with the [[San Francisco Tape Music Center]] along with [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Ramon Sender]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Phil Lesh]] and [[Terry Riley]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=David|title=The San Francisco Tape Music Center|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24892-2}}</ref> He was involved with the premiere of Riley's ''[[In C]]'' and suggested the use of the eighth note pulse, which is now standard in performance of the piece.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1960s ===\n\nReich's early forays into composition involved experimentation with [[twelve-tone composition]], but he found the rhythmic aspects of the number twelve more interesting than the pitch aspects.<ref>Malcolm Ball [http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/malcolmball/reich.htm on Steve Reich] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903103635/http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/malcolmball/reich.htm |date=September 3, 2018 }}</ref> Reich also composed film soundtracks for ''Plastic Haircut'' (1963), ''Oh Dem Watermelons'' (1965), and ''Thick Pucker'' (1965), three films by [[Robert Nelson (filmmaker)|Robert Nelson]]. The soundtrack of ''Plastic Haircut'', composed in 1963, was a short tape collage, possibly Reich's first. The ''Watermelons'' soundtrack used two 19th-century [[minstrel show|minstrel tunes]] as its basis, and used repeated phrasing together in a large five-part [[canon (music)|canon]]. The music for ''Thick Pucker'' arose from street recordings Reich made walking around San Francisco with Nelson, who filmed in black and white 16mm. This film no longer survives. A fourth film from 1965, about 25 minutes long and tentatively entitled \"Thick Pucker II\", was assembled by Nelson from outtakes of that shoot and more of the raw audio Reich had recorded. Nelson was not happy with the resulting film and never showed it.\n\nReich was influenced by fellow minimalist Terry Riley, whose work ''[[In C]]'' combines simple musical patterns, offset in time, to create a slowly shifting, cohesive whole. Reich adopted this approach to compose his first major work, ''It's Gonna Rain''. Composed in 1965, the piece used a fragment of a [[sermon]] about the end of the world given by a black [[Pentecostal]] street-preacher known as Brother Walter. Reich built on his early tape work, transferring the last three words of the fragment, \"it's gonna rain!\", to multiple tape loops which gradually move out of phase with one another.\n\nThe 13-minute ''Come Out'' (1966) uses similarly manipulated recordings of a single spoken line given by Daniel Hamm, one of the falsely accused [[Harlem Six]], who was severely injured by police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Occupied-Territory-Baldwin1966.htm|title=A Report from Occupied Territory|author=James Baldwin|publisher=mindfully.org|date=July 11, 1966|accessdate=April 28, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629144022/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Occupied-Territory-Baldwin1966.htm|archivedate=June 29, 2013|author-link=James Baldwin}}</ref> The survivor, who had been beaten, punctured a bruise on his own body to convince police about his beating. The spoken line includes the phrase \"to let the bruise\u2019s blood come out to show them.\" Reich rerecorded the fragment \"come out to show them\" on two channels, which are initially played in unison. They quickly slip out of sync; gradually the discrepancy widens and becomes a reverberation. The two voices then split into four, looped continuously, then eight, and continues splitting until the actual words are unintelligible, leaving the listener with only the speech's rhythmic and tonal patterns. \n\n''Melodica'' (1966) takes the phase looping idea of his previous works and applies it to instrumental music. Steve Reich took a simple melody, which he played on a [[melodica]], then recorded it. He then sets the melody to two separate channels, and slowly moves them out of phase, creating an intricate interlocking melody. This piece is very similar to ''Come Out'' in rhythmic structure, and are an example of how one rhythmic process can be realized in different sounds to create two different pieces of music. Reich was inspired to compose this piece from a dream he had on May 22, 1966, and put the piece together in one day. ''Melodica'' was the last piece Reich composed solely for tape, and he considers it his transition from tape music to instrumental music.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings on Music, 1965\u20132000|last=Reich|first=Steve|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-511171-0|location=New York|pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nReich's first attempt at translating this phasing technique from recorded tape to live performance was the 1967 ''[[Piano Phase]]'', for two pianos. In ''Piano Phase'' the performers repeat a rapid twelve-note [[melody|melodic]] figure, initially in unison. As one player keeps tempo with robotic precision, the other speeds up very slightly until the two parts line up again, but one sixteenth note apart. The second player then resumes the previous tempo. This cycle of speeding up and then locking in continues throughout the piece; the cycle comes full circle three times, the second and third cycles using shorter versions of the initial figure. ''Violin Phase'', also written in 1967, is built on these same lines. ''Piano Phase'' and ''Violin Phase'' both premiered in a series of concerts given in New York art galleries.\n\nA similar, lesser known example of this so-called [[process music]] is ''Pendulum Music'' (1968), which consists of the sound of several microphones swinging over the loudspeakers to which they are attached, producing [[feedback]] as they do so. \"Pendulum Music\" has never been recorded by Reich himself, but was introduced to rock audiences by [[Sonic Youth]] in the late 1990s.\n\nReich also tried to create the phasing effect in a piece \"that would need no instrument beyond the human body\". He found that the idea of phasing was inappropriate for the simple ways he was experimenting to make sound. Instead, he composed ''[[Clapping Music]]'' (1972), in which the players do not phase in and out with each other, but instead one performer keeps one line of a 12-eighth-note-long (12-quaver-long) phrase and the other performer shifts by one [[eighth note]] beat every 12 bars, until both performers are back in unison 144 bars later.<ref>{{cite book|title=Writings on Music, 1965-2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tMgpu5gSIOMC&pg=PR13&dq=steve+reich#v=onepage&q=steve%20reich&f=false|accessdate=February 28, 2018|isbn = 9780195111712|last1 = Reich|first1 = Steve|date = April 11, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe 1967 prototype piece ''[[Slow Motion Sound]]'' was not performed although [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]] performed it 27 years later as ''[[Slow Motion Blackbird]]'' on his Reich-influenced 1994 album ''[[Shift (Chris Hughes album)|Shift]]''. It introduced the idea of slowing down a recorded sound until many times its original length without changing pitch or timbre, which Reich applied to ''Four Organs'' (1970), which deals specifically with augmentation. The piece has [[maraca]]s playing a fast [[eighth note]] [[pulse (music)|pulse]], while the four organs stress certain eighth notes using an 11th chord. This work therefore dealt with [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and subtle rhythmic change.

''Four Organs'' was performed as part of a [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] program, and was Reich's first composition to be performed in a large traditional setting.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\nIn 1970, Reich embarked on a five-week trip to study music in Ghana, during which he learned from the master drummer Gideon Alorwoyie. Reich also studied Balinese [[gamelan]] in [[Seattle]] in 1973 and 1974.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Reich Biography|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=when+did+steve+reich+study+chinese+bamelan+in+seattle&rlz=1CAHPZP_enUS786US786&safe=active&ssui=on|publisher=Steve Reich|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}</ref>{{When|date=May 2016}}<!--This was in the summer of 1972, but this is a personal recollection and, as such, Original Research.--> From his African experience, as well as [[A. M. Jones]]'s ''[[Studies in African Music]]'' about the [[Ewe music|music of the Ewe]] people, Reich drew inspiration for his 90-minute piece ''[[Drumming (Reich)|Drumming]]'', which he composed shortly after his return. Composed for a nine-piece percussion ensemble with female voices and [[piccolo]], ''Drumming'' marked the beginning of a new stage in his career, for around this time he formed his ensemble, [[Steve Reich and Musicians]], and increasingly concentrated on composition and performance with them. Steve Reich and Musicians, which was to be the sole ensemble to interpret his works for many years, still remains active with many of its original members.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter ''Drumming'', Reich moved on from the \"phase shifting\" technique that he had pioneered, and began writing more elaborate pieces. He investigated other musical processes such as [[augmentation (music)|augmentation]] (the temporal lengthening of phrases and melodic fragments). It was during this period that he wrote works such as ''[[Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ]]'' (1973) and ''[[Six Pianos]]'' (1973).\n\nIn 1974, Reich began writing ''[[Music for 18 Musicians]]''. This piece involved many new ideas, although it also hearkened back to earlier pieces. It is based on a [[cycle (music)|cycle]] of [[chord progression|eleven chords]] introduced at the beginning (called \"Pulses\"), followed by a small section of music based on each [[chord (music)|chord]] (\"Sections I-XI\"), and finally a return to the original cycle (\"Pulses\"). This was Reich's first attempt at writing for larger [[musical ensemble|ensembles]]. The increased number of performers resulted in more scope for psychoacoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to \"explore this idea further\". Reich remarked that this one work contained more harmonic movement in the first five minutes than any other work he had written. Steve Reich and Musicians made the premier recording of this work on [[ECM Records]].\n\nReich explored these ideas further in his frequently recorded pieces ''[[Music for a Large Ensemble]]'' (1978) and ''[[Octet (Reich)|Octet]]'' (1979). In these two works, Reich experimented with \"the human breath as the measure of musical duration ... the chords played by the trumpets are written to take one comfortable breath to perform\".<ref>Liner notes for ''Music for a Large Ensemble''</ref> Human voices are part of the musical palette in ''Music for a Large Ensemble'' but the wordless vocal parts simply form part of the texture (as they do in ''Drumming''). With ''Octet'' and his first orchestral piece ''[[Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards]]'' (also 1979), Reich's music showed the influence of Biblical [[cantillation]], which he had studied in [[Israel]] since the summer of 1977. After this, the human voice singing a text would play an increasingly important role in Reich's music.\n\n{{quote|The technique [...] consists of taking pre-existing melodic patterns and stringing them together to form a longer melody in the service of a holy text. If you take away the text, you're left with the idea of putting together small motives to make longer melodies \u2013 a technique I had not encountered before.<ref>Schwarz, K. Robert. ''Minimalists'', Phaidon Press, 1996, p.84 and p.86.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1974 Reich published the book ''Writings About Music'', containing essays on his philosophy, aesthetics, and musical projects written between 1963 and 1974. An updated and much more extensive collection, ''Writings On Music (1965\u20132000)'', was published in 2002.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nReich's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage. ''[[Tehillim (Reich)|Tehillim]]'' (1981), [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for ''[[psalm]]s'', is the first of Reich's works to draw explicitly on his Jewish background. The work is in four parts, and is scored for an ensemble of four women's voices (one high [[soprano]], two lyric sopranos and one [[alto]]), [[piccolo]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, six percussion (playing small tuned [[tambourine]]s without jingles, clapping, [[maraca]]s, [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]] and [[crotales]]), two [[electronic organ]]s, two violins, [[viola]], cello and [[double bass]], with amplified voices, strings, and winds. A setting of texts from Psalms 19:2\u20135 (19:1\u20134 in Christian translations), 34:13\u201315 (34:12\u201314), 18:26\u201327 (18:25\u201326), and 150:4\u20136, ''Tehillim'' is a departure from Reich's other work in its formal structure; the setting of texts several lines long rather than the fragments used in previous works makes melody a substantive element. Use of formal [[counterpoint]] and functional [[harmony]] also contrasts with the loosely structured minimalist works written previously.\n\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename   = Pat Metheny-Electric Counterpoint III Fast.ogg\n| title    = \"Electric Counterpoint III Fast\" (1989)\n| description = 25 seconds of \"Electric Counterpoint III Fast\" performed by Pat Metheny.

In ''Different Trains'', Reich compares and contrasts his childhood memories of his train journeys between New York and California in 1939\u20131941 with the very different trains being used to transport contemporaneous European children to their deaths under [[Nazism|Nazi]] rule. The [[Kronos Quartet]] recording of ''Different Trains'' was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition]] in 1990. The composition was described by [[Richard Taruskin]] as \"the only adequate musical response\u2014one of the few adequate artistic responses in any medium\u2014to [[the Holocaust]]\", and he credited the piece with earning Reich a place among the great composers of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D91F3FF937A1575BC0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |last=Taruskin |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |title=A Sturdy Musical Bridge to the 21st Century |work=The New York Times |date=August 24, 1997 |accessdate=September 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nIn 1993, Reich collaborated with his wife, the video artist [[Beryl Korot]], on an opera, ''[[The Cave (opera)|The Cave]]'', which explores the roots of Judaism, Christianity and Islam through the words of Israelis, [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], and Americans, echoed musically by the ensemble. The work, for percussion, voices, and strings, is a musical documentary, named for the [[Cave of Machpelah]] in [[Hebron]], where a mosque now stands and [[Abraham]] is said to have been buried.\n\nReich and Korot collaborated on the opera ''[[Three Tales (opera)|Three Tales]]'', which concerns the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]], the testing of [[nuclear weapon]]s on [[Bikini Atoll]], and other more modern concerns, specifically [[Dolly the sheep]], [[cloning]], and the [[technological singularity]].\n\nReich used sampling techniques for pieces like ''Three Tales'' and ''[[City Life (Reich)|City Life]]'' from 1994. Reich returned to composing purely instrumental works for the concert hall, starting with ''Triple Quartet'' in 1998 written for the Kronos Quartet that can either be performed by string quartet and tape, three string quartets or 36-piece string orchestra. According to Reich, the piece is influenced by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s and [[Alfred Schnittke]]'s string quartets, and [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]]'s ''Yo Shakespeare''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevereich.com/articles/NY-VT.html |title=From New York to Vermont: Conversation with Steve Reich |publisher=Stevereich.com |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe instrumental series for the concert hall continued with ''Dance Patterns'' (2002), ''[[Cello Counterpoint]]'' (2003), and sequence of works centered around Variations: ''You Are (Variations)'' (2004), a work which looks back to the vocal writing of works like ''Tehillim'' or ''The Desert Music'', ''[[Variations for Vibes, Pianos, and Strings]]'' in 2005, for the [[London Sinfonietta]] and ''Daniel Variations'' (2006).\n\nin 2002 Reich was invited by [[Walter Fink]] to the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]], as the 12th composer featured.\n\nIn an interview with ''The Guardian'', Reich stated that he continued to follow this direction with his piece ''Double Sextet'' (2007), which was commissioned by [[eighth blackbird]], an American ensemble consisting of the instrumental quintet (flute, clarinet, violin or viola, cello and piano) of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s piece ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' (1912) plus percussion.
