The choreography was staged by [[Busby Berkeley]]. The songs were written by [[Harry Warren]] (music) and [[Al Dubin]] (lyrics). The script was written by [[Rian James]] and James Seymour, with Whitney Bolton, who was not credited, from the 1932 novel of the same name by [[Bradford Ropes]].\n\nThis [[backstage musical]] was very successful at the box office and is now considered a classic by many.

In 1998, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

She is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon ([[Guy Kibbee]]), the show's \"angel\" (financial backer), but while she is busy keeping him both hooked and at arm's length, she is secretly seeing her old [[vaudeville]] partner, out-of-work Pat Denning ([[George Brent]]).\n\nJulian Marsh ([[Warner Baxter]]) is hired to direct, although his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite a long string of successes, he is broke, a result of the 1929 [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash]], so he must make his last show a hit, in order to have enough money to retire.\n\nCast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few \"[[casting couch]]\" innuendos flying around. Na\u00efve newcomer Peggy Sawyer ([[Ruby Keeler]]), who arrives in New York from her home in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], is duped and ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming ([[Una Merkel]]) and Ann \"Anytime Annie\" Lowell ([[Ginger Rogers]]),<ref name=Anytime/> take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee ([[George E. Stone]]); she also sees to it that Ann and Peggy are chosen. The show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler ([[Dick Powell]]), takes an immediate liking to Peggy, as does Pat.\n[[File:JulPeg42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Naive newcomer Peggy makes her first ''faux pas'', antagonizing tough director Julian Marsh]]\n\nWhen Marsh learns about Dorothy's relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy ([[Tom Kennedy (American actor)|Tom Kennedy]]) to rough him up. That, plus her realization that their situation is unhealthy, makes Dorothy and Pat agree not to see each other for a while. He gets a stock job in Philadelphia.\n\nRehearsals continue for five weeks, to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's opening in Philadelphia, when Dorothy breaks her ankle. By the next morning Abner has quarreled with her and wants Julian to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. She, however, tells him that she can't carry the show, but the inexperienced Peggy can. With 200 jobs and his future riding on the outcome, a desperate Julian rehearses Peggy mercilessly (vowing \"I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl\") until an hour before the premiere.\n\nBilly finally gets up the nerve to tell Peggy he loves her; she enthusiastically kisses him. Then Dorothy shows up and wishes her luck, telling her that she and Pat are getting married. The show goes on, and the last twenty minutes of the film are devoted to three [[Busby Berkeley]] production numbers: \"[[Shuffle Off to Buffalo]]\", \"(I'm) Young and Healthy\", and \"[[42nd Street (song)|42nd Street]]\".\n\nThe show is a hit.

It was cut for unknown reasons from the finished film, but an unpublished manuscript of this still exists.\n\nThough the songs of 42nd Street all allude to sex, there is a single moment at the end of \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", when one word of the scripted lyrics, \"belly\", was changed to \"tummy\" presumedly to comply with the then weakly enforced [[Motion Picture Production Code of 1930]]. But in making the change, the filmmakers purposely drew attention to the censored word.  During the last two verses, Una Merkel & Ginger Rogers sing about a traveling salesman who impregnates the farmer's daughter, and then is forced into a shotgun wedding. The lyric as [http://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/craftg/histhrs%20169/shuffle%20off%20to%20buffalo.pdf scripted] is: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his belly...\" But as Ginger sings it, Una gestures to her and she changes the last word: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his bel - - tummy\".\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nThe film premiered in New York on March 9, 1933 at the [[Mark Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and went into general release two days later, becoming one of the most profitable ones of the year, bringing in an estimated gross of $2,300,000, equal to ${{Inflation|US|2300000|1933|fmt=c}} today.

It was cut for unknown reasons from the finished film, but an unpublished manuscript of this still exists.\n\nThough the songs of 42nd Street all allude to sex, there is a single moment at the end of \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", when one word of the scripted lyrics, \"belly\", was changed to \"tummy\" presumedly to comply with the then weakly enforced [[Motion Picture Production Code of 1930]]. But in making the change, the filmmakers purposely drew attention to the censored word.  During the last two verses, Una Merkel & Ginger Rogers sing about a traveling salesman who impregnates the farmer's daughter, and then is forced into a shotgun wedding. The lyric as [http://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/craftg/histhrs%20169/shuffle%20off%20to%20buffalo.pdf scripted] is: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his belly...\" But as Ginger sings it, Una gestures to her and she changes the last word: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his bel - - tummy\".\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nThe film premiered in New York on March 9, 1933 at the [[Mark Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and went into general release two days later, becoming one of the most profitable ones of the year, bringing in an estimated gross of $2,300,000, equal to ${{Inflation|US|2300000|1933|fmt=c}} today.
