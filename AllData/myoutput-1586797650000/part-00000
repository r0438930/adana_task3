It was named for and located on Lake Road (now Pond Road), a street that once ran from [[Oakdale, New York|Oakdale]] to the east side of [[Lake Ronkonkoma (lake)|Lake Ronkonkoma]] itself. By 1850 it was moved to the Dr. E. F. Peck General Store on the northwest corner of what is today Ocean Avenue and Lakeland Street. A freight house existed along the tracks close to Pine Avenue. Edgar Fenn Peck owned land as far south as [[Sayville, New York|Sayville]], and in 1851 sold the store and the land to a developer named Charles Wood, who turned his land into a development named Lakeland Farms, which today includes land in Oakdale, [[Bohemia, New York|Bohemia]], and what is now [[Ronkonkoma, New York|Ronkonkoma]].<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/hermannville.html Lake Road station, Hermanville station, Lake station, Lakeland station, Lakeland Farms, and Wood Lawn, Long Island  (Arrt's Arrchive)]</ref> The original Lake Road station operated simultaneously with the one at the general store on Ocean Avenue, and at some point was renamed \"Lake station,\" until eventually being phased out. No record of the original station's existence can be found after 1857.\n\n===Hermanville station===\n'''Hermanville''' or '''Hermannville''' was another station stop along the [[Greenport Branch]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]], located east of the former Lake Road Station. It first appeared on an 1850 map of the Long Island Rail Road.<ref>[http://arrts-arrchives.com/images3/HERMANNVILLEmapLIeast.jpg Hermannville Map]</ref> The station had one side platform, and two tracks.

At some point, the word \"Lake\" was dropped from the station name. The station house was burned in 1934 and a temporary rectangular one-story building with a gabled roof was used until September 1937, when the second Ronkonkoma station was completed. Throughout much of the 20th Century, it also served as a sizeable freight hub for Central Suffolk County.\n\nSince December 28, 1987, it has been the east end of the Main Line electrification<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/ronkelectrification.htm|title=LIRR Ronkonkoma Electrification 1987|work=trainsarefun.com}}</ref> but stations east of Ronkonkoma have been modified for future electrification. The 1937 station was used for storage until it was razed in 1994 when part of the parking lot was extended westward. The current station was designed by architect Richard Henry Behr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhbpc.com/commercial/ronkonkoma/com_ronk3.htm|title=Richard Henry Behr Architect P.C.|work=rhbpc.com}}</ref> Ronkonkoma Yard is also located east of the station, in close proximity to the former [[Holbrook (LIRR station)|Holbrook]] station, which was torn down in 1962,<ref>[http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/Ronkonkoma/MP49-50%20ronk.jpg Ronkonkoma/Holbrook Milepost 49-50; Emery map (TrainsAreFun.com)]</ref> and has taken in commuters from the former [[Holtsville (LIRR station)|Holtsville]] station since March 16, 1998.\n\n==Station layout==\nThis station is set up using the [[Spanish solution]] with three high-level platforms, each 12 cars long.

Platform B, an [[island platform]], facilitates a [[cross-platform interchange]] when a Ronkonkoma Branch train and a Greenport train arrive at the same time (a move also known as \"The Greenport Scoot\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcaetrain.org/articles/operating/greensport/index.html|title=e-Train - TCA, Toy Trains, Train Collectors Association|work=tcaetrain.org}}</ref>\n\n{|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|'''M'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|'''Mezzanine'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=500 valign=top|Entrance/exit, parking, buses\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 rowspan=7 valign=top|'''P'''<br>Platform level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=500|\n|-\n|style=\"border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|<small>[[Side platform|Platform A]], doors will open on the left or right from Track 1</small> {{access icon}}\n|-\n|width=100|'''Track 1'''\n|width=500|\u2190 '''[[Ronkonkoma Branch|<span style=color:#{{LIRR color|Ronkonkoma}}>Ronkonkoma Branch</span>]]''' toward [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica]], [[Atlantic Terminal|Atlantic]] or [[Penn Station (LIRR station)|Penn Station]] <small>([[Central Islip (LIRR station)|Central Islip]])</small><br>'''[[Greenport Branch|<span style=color:#{{LIRR color|Greenport}}>Greenport Branch</span>]]''' toward [[Riverhead (LIRR station)|Riverhead]] or [[Greenport (LIRR station)|Greenport]] <small>([[Medford (LIRR station)|Medford]])</small> \u2192\n|-\n| style=\"border: 2px solid black; border-image: none; text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" |<small>[[Island platform|Platform B]], doors will open on the left or right from either track</small> {{access icon}}\n|-\n|width=100|'''Track 2'''\n|width=500|\u2190 '''[[Ronkonkoma Branch|<span style=color:#{{LIRR color|Ronkonkoma}}>Ronkonkoma Branch</span>]]''' toward [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica]], [[Atlantic Terminal|Atlantic]] or [[Penn Station (LIRR station)|Penn Station]] <small>([[Central Islip (LIRR station)|Central Islip]])</small><br>'''[[Greenport Branch|<span style=color:#{{LIRR color|Greenport}}>Greenport Branch</span>]]''' toward [[Riverhead (LIRR station)|Riverhead]] or [[Greenport (LIRR station)|Greenport]] <small>([[Medford (LIRR station)|Medford]])</small> \u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|<small>[[Side platform|Platform C]], doors will open on the left or right from Track 2</small> {{access icon}}\n|}\n\n==Mid-Suffolk Yard==\nEast of the Ronkonkoma station is a 12-track train-storage yard called the Ronkonkoma Yard. As this is the eastern end of the electrified portion of the Main Line, the yard stores the [[electric multiple unit]]s that are used on the Ronkonkoma Branch.<ref name=MTA-MidSuffolk/>\n\nIn preparation for the LIRR's [[East Side Access]] expansion to [[Grand Central Terminal]], the MTA is adding 11 new tracks to the yard, for a total of 23 tracks.<ref name=MTA-MidSuffolk>{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/midsuffolkyard/index.htm |title=Mid-Suffolk Yard |work=mta.info}}</ref> The expansion will use space already owned by the MTA located immediately to the south of the existing rail yard and north of [[Long Island MacArthur Airport|MacArthur Airport]]. The increase in storage space will allow the MTA to increase peak-hour service to Manhattan. The project is budgeted for $128.0 million.<ref name=\"Jan 2013\">{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/archive/130128_1330_CPOC.pdf#page=8 |title=MTA Capital Program Oversight Meeting |date=January 2013 |accessdate=May 24, 2018|work=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]] |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |page=8}}</ref><ref name=\"Nov 2017\">{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/archive/140623_1345_CPOC.pdf#page=35 |title=MTA Long Island Rail Road Committee Meeting |date=November 2017 |accessdate=May 24, 2018|work=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]] |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |page=35}}</ref><ref name=\"schedule\">{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/midsuffolkyard/schedule.htm|title=Mid-Suffolk Yard Schedule|last=|first=|date=|work=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}</ref> Locations in Deer Park, Central Islip, and Yaphank were also considered for the construction of the yard.

The Central Islip site was dismissed as it would have been located in [[Connetquot River State Park Preserve|Connetquot River State Park]]. The Yaphank option was rejected because of the high cost of electrification and the requirement that stations between Ronkonkoma and Yaphank receive upgrades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/midsuffolkyard/images/MidSuffolkYard-AlternativeAnalysis.pdf|title=Mid-Suffolk Yard Alternatives Analaysis|last=|first=|date=|work=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nConstruction was expected to be finished by late 2018.<ref name=\"schedule\" /> However, {{As of|2017|June|alt=as of June 2017}} construction was to start in September 2017, with completion being pushed back to March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/capitaldashboard/allframenew_head.html?PROJNUM=l60601yn&PLTYPE=5|title=L60601YN New Mid Suffolk Electric Yard|last=|first=|date=|website=web.mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref> A construction award was finally made in December 2017, and the completion date was pushed back to late 2020.<ref name=\"MTA-CPOC-May2019\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/190520_1400_CPOC.pdf|title=Capital Program Oversight Committee Meeting|date=May 20, 2019|accessdate=May 19, 2019|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]}}</ref>{{rp|32}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Ronkonkoma (LIRR station)}} \n{{LIRR links}}\n*[http://www.lirrhistory.com/jul992/ronk2.JPG Unofficial Long Island Railroad History web site]\n*[http://subwaynut.com/lirr/ronkonkoma/index.html Ronkonkoma Station (The SubwayNut)]\n*NYCSUBWAY.org\n**[http://world.nycsubway.org/perl/show?40705 October 1, 2002 Photos] of [http://world.nycsubway.org/perl/show?40703 Ronkonkoma Station platforms]\n**[http://world.nycsubway.org/perl/show?10665 May 16, 1981 photo taken from the vicinity of Ronkonkoma Station]\n**[http://world.nycsubway.org/perl/show?42276 Photo of the station taken in the 1960s from a bridge]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140202221431/http://lirrpics.com/ronkonkoma.html Unofficial LIRR Photography Site (lirrpics.com) Ronkonkoma Station]\n* [http://thelirrtoday.blogspot.com/2013/07/interlocking-walkthrough-ko.html KO Interlocking (The LIRR Today)]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.80871,-73.10572&spn=0.003906,0.013658&z=17&layer=c&cbll=40.808694,-73.105835&panoid=Na25d-sJyLd47egzXnxN9w&cbp=12,181.29,,0,-2.28 Station House from Google Maps Street View]\n\n{{LIRR stations navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Long Island Rail Road stations in Suffolk County, New York]]\n[[Category:Brookhaven, New York]]\n[[Category:Islip (town), New York]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1883]]\n[[Category:Airport railway stations in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronkonkoma_station"}
