Regardless of how bald the subject was, the results found in relation to the perception of moustaches remained constant.

A. Reed and E. M. Blunk, persons in management positions were shown to positively perceive, and therefore be more likely to hire, men with facial hair.<ref name=\"Reed\">{{cite journal|last=Reed|first=J.

The men in these ink sketches ranged from clean-shaven, to moustachioed, to bearded. The men with facial hair were rated higher by the employers on aspects of masculinity, maturity, physical attractiveness, dominance, self-confidence, nonconformity, courage, industriousness, enthusiasm, intelligence, sincerity, and general competency.<ref name=\"Reed\" /> The results were found to be fairly similar for both female and male employers, which Reed and Blunk suggest would imply that gender does not factor into one's perceptions of a moustache on a male applicant.<ref name=\"Reed\" /> However, Blunk and Reed also stipulate that the meaning and acceptability of facial hair does change depending on the time period. However, the studies performed by Hellstr\u00f6m & Tekle<ref name=\"hellstrom\" /> and also the studies performed by Klapprott<ref name=Klapprott>{{cite journal|last=Klapprott|first=J\u00fcrgen|title=Barba Facit Magistrum: An Investigation into the Effect of a Bearded University Teacher on His Students|journal=Schweizerische Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychologie und Ihre Anwendungen|year=1979|volume=35|issue=1|pages=16\u201327}}</ref> would suggest that moustaches are not favourable to all professions as it has been shown that clean-shaven men are seen as more reliable in roles such as salesmen and professors. Other studies have suggested that acceptability of facial hair may vary depending on culture and location, as in a study conducted in Brazil, clean-shaven men were preferred by personnel managers over applicants who were bearded, goateed, or moustached.<ref name=\"De Souza\">{{cite journal|last=De Souza|first=Altay Alves Lino|author2=Bai\u00e3o, Ver Baumgarten Ulyssea |author3=Otta, Emma |title=Perception of Men's Personal Qualities and Prospect of Employment as a Function of Facial Hair|journal=Psychological Reports|year=2003|volume=92|issue=1|pages=201\u2013208|doi=10.2466/pr0.2003.92.1.201}}</ref>\n\n===Cultures===\nIn Western culture, it has been shown that women dislike men who displayed a visible moustache or beard, but preferred men who had a visible hint of a beard such as stubble (often known as a five-o-clock shadow) over those who were clean-shaven.<ref name=Cunningham>{{cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=M.

However some researchers have suggested that it is possible that in ecologies in which physical aggressiveness is more adaptive than cooperation, bearded men might be preferred by women.<ref name=\"Muscarella\" /> However, varying opinion on moustaches is not reserved to international cultural differences as even within the US, there have been discrepancies observed on female preference of male facial hair as Freedman's study suggested that women studying at the University of Chicago preferred men with facial hair because they perceived them to be more masculine, sophisticated and mature than clean-shaven men.<ref name=Freedman>{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=D.|title=The Survival Value of the Beard|journal=Psychology Today|year=1969|volume=3|issue=10|pages=36\u201339}}</ref> Similarly, a study performed by Kenny and Fletcher at Memphis State University, which is largely a commuter school and usually is regarded as more conventional than the University of Chicago, suggested that men with facial hair such as moustaches and beards, were perceived as stronger and more masculine by female students.<ref name=Kenny>{{cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Charles T.|author2=Fletcher, Dixie|title=Effects of Beardedness on Person Perception|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1973|volume=37|issue=2|pages=413\u2013414|doi=10.2466/pms.1973.37.2.413|pmid=4747356}}</ref> However, the study performed by Feinman and Gill would suggest that this reaction to facial hair is not nationwide, as women studying in the state of Wyoming showed a marked preference for clean-shaven men over men with facial hair.<ref name=Feinman>{{cite journal|last=Feinman|first=Saul|author2=Gill, George W.|title=Female's Response to Male Beardedness|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1977|volume=44|issue=2|pages=533\u2013534|doi=10.2466/pms.1977.44.2.533}}</ref> Some accredit this difference to the difference between region, rurality, and political and social conservatism between the various studies.<ref name=\"Feinman\" /> Thus it can be seen that even within the US, there are slight variations in the perceptions of moustaches.\n\n===Religions===\nIn addition to various cultures, the perception of the moustache is also altered by religion as some religions support the growth of a moustache or facial hair in general, whereas others tend to reject those with moustaches, while many churches remain somewhat ambivalent on the subject.\n\n====Amish====\nWhile [[Amish]] men grow beards after marriage and never trim them, they eschew moustaches and continue shaving their upper lips. This is rooted in a rejection of the German military fashion of sporting moustaches, which was prevalent at the time of the Amish community's formation in [[Switzerland]]; hence serving as a symbol of their commitment to pacifism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/why-do-amish-men-wear-beards-but-not-mustaches-curiosity/|title=Why Do Amish Men Wear Beards But Not Mustaches?|website=Curiosity.com|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n\n====Mormon====\nThough it is never explicitly stated by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] that all male members must be clean-shaven, within Mormon circles it is often considered \"taboo\" for men to have moustaches as the missionaries of the church are required to be clean-shaven as well as the honor code of Brigham Young University requiring students to have similar grooming standards.

For example, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s moustache, grossly exaggerated, featured prominently in [[Triple Entente]] propaganda. Other notable individuals are [[Hitler]], [[Mugabe]] and [[Steve Harvey]]. In other cases, such as those of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Groucho Marx]], the moustache in question was artificial for most of the wearer's life.\n\n=== In art, entertainment, and media===\n\n====Alias====\n*''Moustache'' was the alias name of a French comic actor, Fran\u00e7ois-Alexandre Galipedes (b. 14 February 1929 in Paris, France \u2013 d. 25 March 1987 in Arpajon, Essonne, France), known for his roles in ''[[Paris Blues]]'' (1961), ''[[How to Steal a Million]]'' (1966), and ''[[Zorro (1975 Italian film)|Zorro]]'' (1975)<ref>{{IMDb name|0610116}}</ref>\n\n====Fictional characters====\n*Moustaches have long been used by artists to make characters distinctive, as with [[Charlie Chan]], the video game character [[Mario]], [[Hercule Poirot]], or [[Snidely Whiplash]]. \n*[[Sharabi]] movie from [[Bollywood]] had a character Natthulal whose moustache became a legend. ''Munchhen hon to Natthulal jaisi, warna na hon'' (Moustaches should be like Natthulal's or shouldn't be at all) became one of the most quoted dialogue. \n*At least one fictional moustache has been so notable that a whole style has been named after it: the [[Fu Manchu moustache]].\n\n====Literature====\n*In 1954, [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] published a book dedicated solely to his moustache.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Halsman, Philippe & Dal\u00ed, Salvador |title=Dal\u00ed's Moustache.
