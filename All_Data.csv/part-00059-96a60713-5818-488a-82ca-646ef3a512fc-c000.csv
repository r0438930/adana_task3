Another notable constant on the Moon Nanakshahi Calendar is Guru Nanak Sahib’s birth date.  Though traditionally some celebrate it in October/November.  According to the Shiromani [http://Gurudwara%20Parbandhak%20Committee%20(SGPC) Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC)]http://old.sgpc.net/festivals/index.asp, Guru Nanak Sahib was born on 15th April, 1469 at Rai-Bhoi-di Talwandi in the present district of Shekhupura, now Nanakana Sahib in current-day Pakistan. Since the birthday falls on the full moon day of the month Kartik, that is the day that Sikhs all over the world celebrate the birth of their first guru.

'''Ivor Robinson''' [[MBE]] (28 October 1924 – 19 February 2014) was a British master craftsman and fine bookbinder, one of the most important of the late 20th century. He is particularly known for his mature work with gold-tooled lines on black leather. His work is held in high esteem, entering many public and private collections around the world, and fetching good prices at auction. He was also an influential teacher of bookbinding. He was awarded an MBE 'For Services to Bookbinding.'

== Personal life and biography ==

Robinson was born and raised in Bournemouth (then Hampshire; now Dorset), England. (His younger brother, Brian Robinson, also a bookbinder, still lives there.) He was apprenticed at age 14 with bookbinder S. E. Bray & Co. He volunteered to enlist in the Navy during World War II, where he was present at D-Day, and returned to Bray's to finish his apprenticeship after the War.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Hawksmoor|title=NLSC: Crafts Lives: Ivor Robinson interviewed by Hawksmoor Hughes|url=http://cadensa.bl.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=3mvyMYas32/WORKS-FILE/69860016/9|publisher=British Library|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>

In 1946 Robinson moved to Salisbury to work with binder Harry Bailey, eventually going into partnership with him. While in Salisbury he also taught bookbinding part-time at Salisbury College of Art, where he met Olive Trask, whom he married 14 April 1952.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Hawksmoor|title=Ivor Robinson interviewed by Hawksmoor Hughes|url=http://cadensa.bl.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=3mvyMYas32/WORKS-FILE/69860016/9|publisher=British Library|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref> They had two children, [[Hilary Robinson (scholar)|Hilary Robinson]] (1956 – ) and Martin Robinson (1962 – ).

'''''Sword of the Samurai''''' is an [[action game|action]] and [[strategy video game]] developed and published by [[MicroProse]] in 1989 for the [[DOS]] platform. It features [[role-playing]], strategy, and [[mini-games|arcade]] elements set in [[feudal Japan]]. The player begins the game as a little-known [[gokenin|vassal]] [[samurai]]; his ultimate goal is to replace [[Oda Nobunaga]] as the [[daimyō]] responsible for reunifying [[sengoku Japan]].

[[Tommo]] purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its [[Retroism]] brand in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://docs.bmcgroup.com/Atari/nysb_1-13-bk-10176_313.pdf|title = Purchase Agreement between Atari, Inc. and Rebellion Developments, Stardock & Tommo|date = 2013-07-22|accessdate = |website = |publisher = [[BMC Group]]|last = |first = }}</ref> The game was re-released in 2014 on [[Gog.com]] and [[Steam (software)|Steam]] with support for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]].

==Gameplay==
The game begins by giving the player their choice of name, [[Japanese clans|clan]], and family specialty. Within the game, death is final and frequently risked; an early priority is establishing a family, which permits the player to continue as the [[samurai]]'s heir in the event of death or retirement. In the first two sections of the game, the player rises from a minor [[gokenin|retainer]] to a more powerful [[hatamoto|lieutenant]] and then to [[daimyō]] over his entire [[Japanese clans|clan]]. At each of these levels, he competes to curry favor from his lord with three computer-controlled rivals who also seek to become first in favor and next in succession. Each samurai has several properties, including land holdings, army size, sword-fighting ability, and generalship. In keeping with the [[Bushidō]] theme of the game, army size and  honor have the greatest influence over how the samurai are ranked.

A wide array of dishonorable actions are also possible. The player (and AI controlled characters) may kidnap and rescue family members, dishonor other samurai, or even assassinate their rivals or lord. Naturally, such behavior carries serious risk. The samurai performs these acts personally and risks capture or death. At minimum, exposure entails loss of honor and land and more serious offenses require ritual suicide ([[seppuku]]); a failed attempt on the life of the samurai's lord occasions the [[three exterminations|extermination of his entire family]], losing the game.

After becoming a [[daimyō]], the game shifts to a wargame format, with the goal of conquering enough provinces to claim the title of [[shōgun]]. The player no longer wanders personally through a provincial map but directs his army through the three lower [[Japanese islands]]. He is able to direct his underlings to deal with any sword fight or melee minigames without loss of honor: the focus is on the size of the player's army and mastery of the battlefield tactics.

After winning the game, the player is given a final summary of the future of his dynasty. Depending on various factors such as the victor's honor and the presence of an adult heir, the length of the [[Shogun#Heian period .28794.E2.80.931185.29|dynasty]] could range from hundreds of years (like the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]) to a quick dissolution after the shōgun's death (as occurred with [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]).

==Development==
MicroProse designers Sid Arnold and Lawrence Schick began development of ''Sword of the Samurai'' in late 1987, after the success of the company's first role-playing adventure game ''[[Sid Meier's Pirates!]]''. They chose to set it during the [[Sengoku period]] because the era's chaos made it possible for samurai to gain great power regardless of background, and gave players the goal of uniting the country and becoming shōgun. MicroProse co-owner [[Sid Meier]] helped develop the NPCs' artificial intelligence and the dueling.<ref name=\"schick199001\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=67 | title=Designer's Notes / The Secret History of Sword of the Samurai | work=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1990 | accessdate=15 November 2013 | author=Schick, Lawrence | pages=84}}</ref>

"Updating sentence starting with \"The term '''p-process''' (''p'' is forproton)...\"(WG)",safe,Tridwoxi,"{{Short description|processes in astrophysics}}
{{lowercase title}}
The term '''p-process''' (''p'' for [[proton]]) is used in two ways in the scientific literature concerning the [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] origin of the elements ([[nucleosynthesis]]). Originally it referred to a proton capture process which is the source of certain, naturally occurring, proton-rich [[isotope]]s of the [[chemical element|elements]] from [[selenium]] to [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name=\"b2fh\">{{cite journal | title = Synthesis of the Elements in Stars | authorlink1 = Margaret Burbidge | author1 = Burbidge, E. M. | authorlink2 = Geoffrey Burbidge | author2 = Burbidge, G. R. | authorlink3 = William Alfred Fowler | author3 = Fowler, W. A. | authorlink4 = Fred Hoyle | author4 = Hoyle, F. | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–650 | date = 1957 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.547 | bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..547B }}</ref><ref name=\"cameron\">{{cite journal | authorlink = Alastair Cameron | author = Cameron, A. G. W. | title = Nuclear Reactions in Stars and Nucleogenesis | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | date = 1957 | volume = 69 | issue = 408 | pages = 201–222 | jstor = 40676435 | bibcode = 1957PASP...69..201C |doi = 10.1086/127051 }}</ref> These [[nuclide]]s are called [[p-nuclei]] and their origin is still not completely understood. Although it was shown that the originally suggested process cannot produce the p-nuclei, later on the term p-process was sometimes used to generally refer to any [[nucleosynthesis]] process supposed to be responsible for the p-nuclei.<ref name=\"arnould\">{{cite journal | author = Arnould, M. | author2 = Goriely, S. | title = The p-Process of Stellar Nucleosynthesis: Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Status | journal = Physics Reports | date = 2003 | volume = 384 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–84 | bibcode = 2003PhR...384....1A | doi = 10.1016/S0370-1573(03)00242-4 }}</ref>

Often, the two meanings are confused. Recent scientific literature therefore suggests to use the term p-process only for the actual proton capture process, as it is customary with other nucleosynthesis processes in astrophysics.<ref name=\"posnic2010\">{{ cite journal | author = Rauscher, T. | title = Origin of p-Nuclei in Explosive Nucleosynthesis | journal = Proceedings of Science | date = 2010 | volume = NIC XI | issue = 59 | arxiv = 1012.2213|bibcode = 2010arXiv1012.2213R }}</ref>

==The proton capture p-process==
Proton-rich nuclides can be produced by sequentially adding one or more protons to an [[atomic nucleus]]. Such a [[nuclear reaction]] of type (p,γ) is called ''proton capture reaction''. By adding a proton to a nucleus, the [[chemical element|element]] is changed because the chemical element is defined by the [[proton number]] of a nucleus. At the same time the ratio of protons to [[neutron]]s is changed, resulting in a proton-richer isotope of the next element. This led to the original idea for the production of p-nuclei: free protons (the nuclei of [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s are present in stellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]]) should be captured on heavy nuclei (''seed nuclei'') also already present in the stellar plasma (previously produced in the [[s-process|''s''-process]] and/or [[r-process|''r''-process]]).<ref name=\"b2fh\" /><ref name=\"cameron\" />

Such proton captures on [[stable nuclide]]s (or nearly stable), however, are not very efficient in producing p-nuclei, especially the heavier ones, because the [[electric charge]] increases with each added proton, leading to an increased repulsion of the next proton to be added, according to [[Coulomb's law]]. In the context of nuclear reactions this is called a [[Coulomb barrier]]. The higher the Coulomb barrier, the more [[kinetic energy]] a proton requires to get close to a nucleus and be captured by it. The average energy of the available protons is given by the [[temperature]] of the stellar plasma. Even if this temperature could be increased arbitrarily (which is not the case in stellar environments), protons would be removed faster from a nucleus by [[photodisintegration]] than they could be captured at high temperature. A possible alternative would be to have a very large number of protons available to increase the effective number of proton captures per second without having to raise the temperature too much. Such conditions, however, are not found in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]] which were supposed to be the site of the p-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />

Proton captures at extremely high proton densities are called [[P-nuclei#Rapid proton capture processes|rapid proton capture processes]]. They are distinct from the p-process not only by the required high proton density but also by the fact that very short-lived [[radionuclides]] are involved and the reaction path is located close to the [[proton drip line]]. Rapid proton capture processes are the [[rp-process]], the [[P-nuclei#The .CE.BDp-process|&nu;p-process]], and the [[P-nuclei#The pn-process|pn-process]].

==History==
The term p-process was originally proposed in the famous [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]] in 1957. The authors assumed that this process was solely responsible for the p-nuclei and proposed that it occurs in the hydrogen-shell (see also [[stellar evolution]]) of a [[star]] exploding as a [[type II supernova]].<ref name=\"b2fh\" />  It was shown later that the required conditions are not found in such supernovae.<ref name=\"truran\">{{ cite journal | author = Audouze, J. | author2 = Truran, J. W. | title = p-Process Nucleosynthesis in Postshock Supernova Envelope Environments | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | date = 1975 | volume = 202 | issue = 1 | pages = 204–213 | bibcode = 1975ApJ...202..204A | doi = 10.1086/153965 }}</ref>

At the same time as B<sup>2</sup>FH, [[Alastair Cameron]] independently realized the necessity to add another nucleosynthesis process to [[neutron capture nucleosynthesis]] but simply mentioned proton captures without assigning a special name to the process. He also thought about alternatives, for example photodisintegration (called the [[Gamma process (astrophysics)|&gamma;-process]] today) or a combination of p-process and photodisintegration.<ref name=\"cameron\" />

{{lowercase title}}
The term '''p-process''' (''p'' is for [[proton]]) is used in two ways in the scientific literature concerning the [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] origin of the elements ([[nucleosynthesis]]). Originally it referred to a proton capture process which is the source of certain, naturally occurring, proton-rich [[isotope]]s of the [[chemical element|elements]] from [[selenium]] to [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name=\"b2fh\">{{cite journal | title = Synthesis of the Elements in Stars | authorlink1 = Margaret Burbidge | author1 = Burbidge, E. M. | authorlink2 = Geoffrey Burbidge | author2 = Burbidge, G. R. | authorlink3 = William Alfred Fowler | author3 = Fowler, W. A. | authorlink4 = Fred Hoyle | author4 = Hoyle, F. | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–650 | date = 1957 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.547 | bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..547B }}</ref><ref name=\"cameron\">{{cite journal | authorlink = Alastair Cameron | author = Cameron, A.

W. | title = Nuclear Reactions in Stars and Nucleogenesis | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | date = 1957 | volume = 69 | issue = 408 | pages = 201–222 | jstor = 40676435 | bibcode = 1957PASP...69..201C |doi = 10.1086/127051 }}</ref> These [[nuclide]]s are called [[p-nuclei]] and their origin is still not completely understood. Although it was shown that the originally suggested process cannot produce the p-nuclei, later on the term p-process was sometimes used to generally refer to any [[nucleosynthesis]] process supposed to be responsible for the p-nuclei.<ref name=\"arnould\">{{cite journal | author = Arnould, M. | author2 = Goriely, S. | title = The p-Process of Stellar Nucleosynthesis: Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Status | journal = Physics Reports | date = 2003 | volume = 384 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–84 | bibcode = 2003PhR...384....1A | doi = 10.1016/S0370-1573(03)00242-4 }}</ref>

Often, the two meanings are confused. Recent scientific literature therefore suggests to use the term p-process only for the actual proton capture process, as it is customary with other nucleosynthesis processes in astrophysics.<ref name=\"posnic2010\">{{ cite journal | author = Rauscher, T. | title = Origin of p-Nuclei in Explosive Nucleosynthesis | journal = Proceedings of Science | date = 2010 | volume = NIC XI | issue = 59 | arxiv = 1012.2213|bibcode = 2010arXiv1012.2213R }}</ref>

==The proton capture p-process==
Proton-rich nuclides can be produced by sequentially adding one or more protons to an [[atomic nucleus]]. Such a [[nuclear reaction]] of type (p,γ) is called ''proton capture reaction''. By adding a proton to a nucleus, the [[chemical element|element]] is changed because the chemical element is defined by the [[proton number]] of a nucleus. At the same time the ratio of protons to [[neutron]]s is changed, resulting in a proton-richer isotope of the next element. This led to the original idea for the production of p-nuclei: free protons (the nuclei of [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s are present in stellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]]) should be captured on heavy nuclei (''seed nuclei'') also already present in the stellar plasma (previously produced in the [[s-process|''s''-process]] and/or [[r-process|''r''-process]]).<ref name=\"b2fh\" /><ref name=\"cameron\" />

Such proton captures on [[stable nuclide]]s (or nearly stable), however, are not very efficient in producing p-nuclei, especially the heavier ones, because the [[electric charge]] increases with each added proton, leading to an increased repulsion of the next proton to be added, according to [[Coulomb's law]]. In the context of nuclear reactions this is called a [[Coulomb barrier]]. The higher the Coulomb barrier, the more [[kinetic energy]] a proton requires to get close to a nucleus and be captured by it. The average energy of the available protons is given by the [[temperature]] of the stellar plasma. Even if this temperature could be increased arbitrarily (which is not the case in stellar environments), protons would be removed faster from a nucleus by [[photodisintegration]] than they could be captured at high temperature. A possible alternative would be to have a very large number of protons available to increase the effective number of proton captures per second without having to raise the temperature too much. Such conditions, however, are not found in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]] which were supposed to be the site of the p-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />

Proton captures at extremely high proton densities are called [[P-nuclei#Rapid proton capture processes|rapid proton capture processes]]. They are distinct from the p-process not only by the required high proton density but also by the fact that very short-lived [[radionuclides]] are involved and the reaction path is located close to the [[proton drip line]]. Rapid proton capture processes are the [[rp-process]], the [[P-nuclei#The .CE.BDp-process|&nu;p-process]], and the [[P-nuclei#The pn-process|pn-process]].

==History==
The term p-process was originally proposed in the famous [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]] in 1957. The authors assumed that this process was solely responsible for the p-nuclei and proposed that it occurs in the hydrogen-shell (see also [[stellar evolution]]) of a [[star]] exploding as a [[type II supernova]].<ref name=\"b2fh\" />  It was shown later that the required conditions are not found in such supernovae.<ref name=\"truran\">{{ cite journal | author = Audouze, J. | author2 = Truran, J. W. | title = p-Process Nucleosynthesis in Postshock Supernova Envelope Environments | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | date = 1975 | volume = 202 | issue = 1 | pages = 204–213 | bibcode = 1975ApJ...202..204A | doi = 10.1086/153965 }}</ref>

At the same time as B<sup>2</sup>FH, [[Alastair Cameron]] independently realized the necessity to add another nucleosynthesis process to [[neutron capture nucleosynthesis]] but simply mentioned proton captures without assigning a special name to the process. He also thought about alternatives, for example photodisintegration (called the [[Gamma process (astrophysics)|&gamma;-process]] today) or a combination of p-process and photodisintegration.<ref name=\"cameron\" />

'''Whitwell''' is a small village located in [[Derbyshire]], England. The population of the civil parish (including Whitwell Common) taken at the 2011 Census was 3,900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11130606&c=Whitwell&d=16&e=62&g=6413200&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1458312682616&enc=1|title=Civil Parish population 2011|accessdate=18 March 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}</ref>

Although Whitwell celebrated its 1,000th anniversary in the 'Whitwell 1000' celebrations of 1989, it is much older than this celebration suggests. The earliest written references to Whitwell are from the Anglo-Saxon charters. However, many of its historical sites predate this period. Within the parish are several [[Iron Age]] burial mounds, an Iron Age fort and settlement, the remains of a Roman villa, medieval field systems, and both a Norman and Saxon church, the world heritage site of [[Creswell Crags]] was until recently within the parish. [[Whitwell Old Hall]] is a medieval manor house.

Whitwell won the 'Best Kept Village in Derbyshire' Award in 1988.

Whitwell is a thriving village with strong community spirit. The village has many active clubs and societies, including Whitwell Scout and Guide Group, Local History Group, Whitwell Players, Whitwell Brass Band and junior band, C of E, Methodist and Poplar churches, Natural History Group, green bowls club, cricket club, and football club.

Although being quite a small village, Whitwell has six public houses.  It previously had as many as 11 and held the record for most number of licensed premises per capita. The current pubs are Holmefield Arms, The Jack Ups (Whitwell Working Men's Club), New Middle Club, The Boot And Shoe, The Half Moon and The Royal Oak. The biggest employer just outside the village is La Farge Works (formerly Steetley Company), which run a quarry which supplies limestone and other products all around the world.

==Whitwell Wood==
Whitwell Wood is a large area of ancient woodland covering approximately 171 hectares. It forms part of the Welbeck Estate, one of the former medieval dukeries of Nottinghamshire. The wood is managed on a long term lease by the Forestry Commission. It is a predominantly broad-leaved wood with over 20 species indicating ancient woodland, a number of interesting archaeological features and a freshwater spring known as the Ginny Spring. The spring is designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This designation is partly due to the varied flora, but also because of a number of species that are rare in the region. As such, the wood has a very high nature conservation status. A [[Three Shire Oak]] once stood in a field adjacent to Whitwell Wood. The oak traditionally marked the meeting point of the borders of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. However, the tree actually stood some distance to the south of the actual border, which is located closer to the Nottinghamshire village of [[Shireoaks]].

=== Whitwell Gap (Hwitan Wylles Geat) - Creswell Crags ===
Until Creswell village was developed by the colliery company in the late 19th Century, Creswell Crags was known locally as Whitwell Crags.Up until this time , there were only a few farms around the entrance to the Crags.The nearest local Anglo Saxon villages were Whitwell, Elmton & Thorpe (Salvin). According to a local resident whose relatives lived in the farms close to the Crags,  Creswell was only the name of the farm nearest to the new colliery site, and used as a drop off point for materials used in the building of the colliery.  The original name of the Crags (Whitwell Crags) may be the  location referred to by the Anglo Saxon poets who recorded King Alfred's grandson, King Edmund conquering the 5 Boroughs from the Viking Earls in 942 AD, reaching as far as Dore & \"Hwitan Wylles Geat\" (the Whitwell Gap).

'''Whitwell''' is a small village located in [[Derbyshire]], England. The population of the civil parish (including Whitwell Common) taken at the 2011 Census was 3,900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11130606&c=Whitwell&d=16&e=62&g=6413200&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1458312682616&enc=1|title=Civil Parish population 2011|accessdate=18 March 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}</ref>

Although Whitwell celebrated its 1,000th anniversary in the 'Whitwell 1000' celebrations of 1989, it is much older than this celebration suggests. The earliest written references to Whitwell are from the Anglo-Saxon charters. However, many of its historical sites predate this period. Within the parish are several [[Iron Age]] burial mounds, an Iron Age fort and settlement, the remains of a Roman villa, medieval field systems, and both a Norman and Saxon church, the world heritage site of [[Creswell Crags]] was until recently within the parish. [[Whitwell Old Hall]] is a medieval manor house.

Whitwell won the 'Best Kept Village in Derbyshire' Award in 1988.

Whitwell is a thriving village with strong community spirit. The village has many active clubs and societies, including Whitwell Scout and Guide Group, Local History Group, Whitwell Players, Whitwell Brass Band and junior band, C of E, Methodist and Poplar churches, Natural History Group, green bowls club, cricket club, and football club.

Although being quite a small village, Whitwell has six public houses.  It previously had as many as 11 and held the record for most number of licensed premises per capita. The current pubs are Holmefield Arms, The Jack Ups (Whitwell Working Men's Club), New Middle Club, The Boot And Shoe, The Half Moon and The Royal Oak. The biggest employer just outside the village is La Farge Works (formerly Steetley Company), which run a quarry which supplies limestone and other products all around the world.

==Whitwell Wood==
Whitwell Wood is a large area of ancient woodland covering approximately 171 hectares. It forms part of the Welbeck Estate, one of the former medieval dukeries of Nottinghamshire. The wood is managed on a long term lease by the Forestry Commission. It is a predominantly broad-leaved wood with over 20 species indicating ancient woodland, a number of interesting archaeological features and a freshwater spring known as the Ginny Spring. The spring is designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This designation is partly due to the varied flora, but also because of a number of species that are rare in the region. As such, the wood has a very high nature conservation status. A [[Three Shire Oak]] once stood in a field adjacent to Whitwell Wood. The oak traditionally marked the meeting point of the borders of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. However, the tree actually stood some distance to the south of the actual border, which is located closer to the Nottinghamshire village of [[Shireoaks]].

===== Whitwell Gap (Hwitan Wylles Geat) - Creswell Crags=====
Until Creswell village was developed by the colliery company in the late 19th Century, Creswell Crags was known locally as Whitwell Crags.Up until this time , there were only a few farms around the entrance to the Crags.The nearest local Anglo Saxon villages were Whitwell, Elmton & Thorpe (Salvin). According to a local resident whose relatives lived in the farms close to the Crags,  Creswell was only the name of the farm nearest to the new colliery site, and used as a drop off point for materials used in the building of the colliery.  The original name of the Crags (Whitwell Crags) may be the  location referred to by the Anglo Saxon poets who recorded King Alfred's grandson, King Edmund conquering the 5 Boroughs from the Viking Earls in 942 AD, reaching as far as Dore & \"Hwitan Wylles Geat\" (the Whitwell Gap). Whitwell Gap would have to be a significant landscape feature to warrant mention in an Anglo Saxon chronicle, and be easily identifiable.

'''''Aphis gossypii''''' is a tiny insect, an [[aphid]] (\"greenfly\") in the superfamily [[Aphidoidea]] in the order [[Hemiptera]]. It is a true bug and sucks sap from plants. It is a widely distributed pest of a variety of agricultural crops in the families [[Cucurbitaceae]], [[Rutaceae]] and [[Malvaceae]].<ref name=\"Schirmer\">{{cite journal | url = http://www.eje.cz/pdfarticles/1311/eje_105_1_121_Schirmer.pdf | author = Stefanie Schirmer, Cetin Sengonca and Peter Blaeser | title = Influence of abiotic factors on some biological and ecological characteristics of the aphid parasitoid ''Aphelinus asychis'' (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) parasitizing ''Aphis gossypii'' (Sternorrhyncha: Aphididae) |journal=[[European Journal of Entomology]] |volume=105 |pages=121–129 |year=2008 | doi=10.14411/eje.2008.017}}</ref> Common names include '''cotton aphid''', '''melon aphid''' and '''melon and cotton aphid'''.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/>

==Distribution==
It is not known where this species originated, but it is now found in tropical and temperate regions throughout the world except extreme northern areas. It is common in North and South America, Central Asia, Africa, Australia,<ref name=\"AG\"/> Brazil, East Indies, Mexico and Hawaii and in most of Europe. It is cosmopolitan in habitat. It thrives outdoors in southern Europe but survives only under glass in northern Europe.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/> In the former Soviet Union it is found up to 54°N.<ref name=\"AG\"/>

==Morphology==
The wingless female cotton aphid has an ovoid body  about two millimetres long in varying shades of green. The legs are yellow, as are the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] which are three quarters of the length of the body. The apices of the [[femora]], [[tibia]] and [[Arthropod leg|tarsi]] are black. The cylindrical black [[siphunculi]] are wide at the base and one fifth of the body length. The winged female has a fusiform body. Its head and thorax are black, the abdomen yellowish-green with black lateral spots and the antennae are longer than those of the [[apterous]] female.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/> The nymphs vary in colour, being shades of green, tan and gray. They often have a dark head, thorax and wing pads and the distal portion of the abdomen is usually dark green. The body appears dull because it is dusted with wax secretions. The oval eggs are yellow when first laid but soon turn glossy black.<ref name=\"FC\">[http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/veg/aphid/melon_aphid.htm University of Florida]</ref>

In the southern half of the US, as far north as Arkansas, sexual reproduction of the cotton aphid is not important. Females continue to produce offspring without mating so long as the weather is favourable for feeding and growth.<ref name=\"FC\"/> Further north, the cotton aphid can be [[holocyclic]] and involve two host species, with a broadleaved tree such as [[Catalpa]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|Rhamnus]] or [[Hibiscus]] acting as the primary host. In Europe it reproduces exclusively by [[apomixis|asexual reproduction]] and can produce nearly fifty generations a year under favourable conditions.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/> In Russia various wild plants are hosts to the overwintering eggs.<ref name=\"AG\">[http://www.agroatlas.ru/en/content/pests/Aphis_gossypii/ AgroAtlas]</ref> Winged forms then migrate to secondary host species in the families [[Rosaceae]], [[Chenopodiaceae]], [[Malvaceae]], [[Cruciferae]], [[Cucurbitaceae]], [[Solanaceae]], [[Compositae]] and others. [[Parthenogenesis]] on these hosts allows large populations of aphids to build up quickly. The life span of a parthenogenic female is about twenty days in which time it can produce up to 85 nymphs.<ref name=\"AG\"/> These mature in about twenty days at 10&nbsp;°C and in about four days at 30&nbsp;°C.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/> As autumn approaches, the winged forms migrate back to the primary hosts. Here, both males and sexual females are produced, mating takes place and the females lay eggs which overwinter, ready to repeat the life cycle the following year.<ref name=\"AG\"/>

Predators include [[midges]], [[lacewings]], [[syrphid fly]] larvae, [[Anthocoridae|anthocorid bugs]] and [[ladybirds]] (ladybeetles). Several members of the [[Aphidiinae]] and [[Aphelinidae]] wasp families are [[parasitoids]] of aphids.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/> One which shows promise as a biocontrol agent is ''[[Aphelinus asychis]]''.<ref name=\"Schirmer\"/>

==Host plants==
[[File:Aphis gossypii01.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Cotton plant]] damaged by Aphis gossypii.]]
The cotton aphid has a very wide host range with at least 60 host plants being known in Florida and perhaps 700 worldwide. Among cucurbit vegetables, it can seriously affect [[watermelons]], [[cucumbers]], [[cantaloupes]], [[squash (plant)|squash]] and [[pumpkin]]. Other vegetable crops attacked include [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[eggplant]], [[okra]] and [[asparagus]]. It also affects [[citrus]], [[cotton]] and [[hibiscus]].<ref name=\"FC\"/>

==Economic significance==
The adults and nymphs of the cotton aphid feed on the underside of leaves or on the growing tips of shoots, sucking juices from the plant. The foliage may become chlorotic and die prematurely. There is often a great deal of leaf curling and distortion which hinders efficient photosynthesis. Honeydew is excreted by the aphids and this allows sooty moulds to grow, resulting in a decrease in the quantity and quality of the produce. The aphids are a vector of crinkle, [[Mosaic virus|mosaic]], [[Groundnut rosette virus|rosette]], [[Citrus tristeza virus|CTV]] and other virus diseases. The aphids' impact is especially important on vegetable crops such as courgette, melon, cucumber, aubergine and strawberry and on cotton, citrus and mallow.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/>

The Lorain Yard closed in 1984 after a series of labor disputes.  The land is now being redeveloped as an upscale housing development.

In the early 1960s, the American Shipbuilding Company acquired Kinsman Marine Transit Company, which was owned by the Steinbrenner family. As a result of the transaction, the Steinbrenner family acquired a controlling interest in American Shipbuilding. Frustrated after years of fighting with unions over cost-saving work changes, the Steinbrenners closed the Lorain shipyard in December 1983 and moved all operations to Tampa, Florida.  The principal member of the Steinbrenner family who was involved in the operation of the transit company at this time was [[George Steinbrenner]], who became better known later as the principal owner of the [[New York Yankees]].

The company began having difficulties in the 1980s, going through a bankruptcy in 1993. The company was sold in 1995.

==The equal age of consent campaign==
When male [[homosexuality]] was decriminalised in [[England and Wales]] in 1967, the age of consent was set at 21. It was lowered to 18 in 1994, but Morris and Sutherland took their case to Europe to demand it be reduced further to 16, the same age as it is for heterosexuals. They invoked Articles 8 and 19 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which guarantee the right to a private life and protection from discrimination.<ref>[http://www.stonewall.org.uk/information_bank/criminal_law/66.asp Information Bank: Age of Consent – Changing the Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105015547/http://www.stonewall.org.uk/information_bank/criminal_law/66.asp |date=5 January 2007 }} from [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]]; accessed 17 February 2007</ref>

Their case was originally backed by the [[gay rights]] group [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]] and later Morris formed his own organisation, [[YouthSpeak]], which was funded by Sir [[Ian McKellen]]. YouthSpeak sent delegations of teenagers to meet MPs and the media to tell their personal stories about how an unequal age of consent affected their lives. The group also projected a laser beam onto [[Big Ben]] demanding \"16 for everyone\" and delivered a 25,000-strong petition to new prime minister [[Tony Blair]] when he was elected in May 1997.<ref>http://www.queeryouth.org.uk/community/index.php?act=Issues&CODE=83&ISSUE=Timeline</ref>

Opposition to the campaign was led by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] peer [[Janet Young, Baroness Young|Baroness Young]] and the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[George Carey]], among others.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7441/Row-gay-age-consent.html Row over gay age of consent]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/317364.stm Peers prepare for gay consent clash ]</ref>

In July 1997, the European Court found that the existence of different ages of consent was discriminatory and that no valid grounds existed to justify that discrimination.  They therefore found that the age of consent for homosexual acts should be lowered to 16. In arriving at their conclusion, the court cited their reasoning in the previous cases, ''[[Dudgeon v United Kingdom]]'' and ''[[Norris v. Ireland]]''.

In response to the court's findings, the then [[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] agreed with Sutherland and Morris that a Bill would be proposed to Parliament in the summer of 1998 to reduce the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16. The Court approved their \"friendly settlement\".<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo980622/debtext/80622-21.htm Hansard Debates for 22 June 1998: Column 756]</ref>

After two defeats in the [[House of Lords]], the law was eventually changed as part of the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]], after the use of the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]], in November 2000.

With OutRage!, he broke into [[Lambeth Palace]] and confronted the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[George Carey]], about his opposition to an equal age of consent.

{{BLP sources|date=August 2014}}
'''David Bentley''' is a Canadian businessman from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] who has been involved in print media since the 1970s.

Born in [[England]], Bentley emigrated to Nova Scotia in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dalgazette.com/news/frank-by-name-frank-by-nature/|title=Frank by name, frank by nature|work=The Dalhousie Gazette|date=December 7, 2010|accessdate=2015-10-31}}</ref>

==''The Daily News''==

Bentley and his wife Diana, along with Patrick and Joyce Sims, founded, The Great Eastern News Company Ltd., in 1974 and started publishing a weekly broadsheet named ''The Bedford-Sackville News'', which focused on the suburban communities of [[Bedford, Nova Scotia|Bedford]] and [[Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia|Lower Sackville]] within the Halifax-Dartmouth metropolitan area.

The Great Eastern News Company Ltd., was initially published out of Bentley's home but a press was acquired in 1978 and the company moved into a new building. A year later the format changed to a tabloid and began publishing six days a week as ''The Bedford-Sackville Daily News''. The paper gained a reputation for printing stories that were not covered by its competition, ''[[The Chronicle Herald]]'', some of which were considered sensational. In 1981, Bentley's company moved into downtown Halifax from its suburban base and renamed the tabloid as ''[[The Daily News (Halifax)|The Daily News]]'', while gaining a reputation for hard-hitting stories and expanded sports coverage.

In 1985 the [[Newfoundland Capital Corporation]] or NCC gained a controlling interest in the paper and purchased Bentley's remaining share in 1987.

==''Frank''==

With the money received from sale of ''The Daily News'' to NCC, Bentley, along with [[Lyndon Watkins]] and [[Dulcie Conrad]] started a bi-weekly \"gossip rag\" or \"scandal magazine\" known as ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]'' to sell the sensational news coverage that mainstream press was averse to covering. Rare to the industry, the magazine had no advertising and operated solely from its print sales.

The first issue was published in November 1987 and focused on gossip about the private lives of the rich, famous and politically connected in the [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]].

Bentley expanded the ''Frank'' franchise to include an [[Ottawa]] edition in 1989 with the help of Michael Bate. This edition quickly outsold its Maritime counterpart, feeding off the void of gossip news in mainstream media in the nation's capital.

Bentley followed a successful formula with the magazine, feeding the need for gossip among the powerful, as well as the average citizen. It was often rumoured that each edition was incorporated as a separate legal entity, leaving no assets for potential lawsuits over libel, however there is no proof that this was ever done.

While the Maritime edition continued to grow in popularity, the Ottawa edition took off in just a few years, rising from a start of 600 copies to a publishing run of over 16,000 at the height of the [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]] years. It was during this time that the Ottawa edition of ''Frank'' brought the magazine its greatest notoriety by satirically running a contest in 1991 inviting young [[Tory|Tories]] to \"Deflower [[Caroline Mulroney]], invoking the Prime Minister's wrath on Bentley and his partners. Mulroney joined several women's groups in denouncing the ad as an incitement to rape, but the magazine maintained that it was commenting on the Prime Minister's perceived habit of using his daughter as a political prop. The magazine also scooped the identity of former Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s love child with [[Deborah Coyne]] in 1991.

Bate subsequently bought out Bentley and his other partners to take the Ottawa edition of ''Frank'' independent.

Bentley continued with his publication of the Maritime edition of ''Frank'', leading the magazine to several scoops, including the charges of sexual assault against former [[Premier of Nova Scotia]] and Trudeau-era cabinet minister [[Gerald Regan]], in which he was subsequently acquitted.

Dulcie Conrad sold her share of the Maritime edition of ''Frank'' in the mid-1990s to Bentley and Watkins. In September 2000, Bentley and Watkins sold an equity stake in the Maritime edition of ''Frank'' to one of the magazine's reporters, Clifford Boutilier.

==''allNovaScotia''==

In March 2001, Bentley and his daughter Caroline Wood launched an online Monday to Friday business newspaper focusing exclusively on Nova Scotian businesses entitled, ''allNovaScotia''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/subscription-news-site-allnovascotia-expands-to-newfoundland/article28830527/|title=Subscription news site AllNovaScotia expands to Newfoundland| last= Bradshaw | first= James|work=The Globe and Mail|date=February 22, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}</ref>

→‎References:add authority control,safe,Ser Amantio di Nicolao,"'''Dalmiro Antonio Sáenz''' (June 13, 1926 – September 11, 2016) was an Argentinian  writer and playwright.

==Biography==
Dalmiro Antonio Saenz was born in Buenos Aires, in 1926. He began his literary activity early on, and began to publish by his 30s after he traveled during several seasons by ship through [[Patagonia]], he settled there for almost 15 years, where he developed his first storybook:  \"Seventy Times Seven,\" which won the prestigious award of Editorial Emecé, and became a [[bestseller]], based in a vision that is violent, erotic, and with solid precepts and moral questions about religion. That is what would become the hallmark of Sáenz for several years. The critics agree in indicating that a religious axis always passes through the stories of this author; either through one of his characters or as in \"Christ Pie\", where religiosity is in controversy with the established religion, as opposed to the individual dialogue that the character has with God).
Later on, he participated in the screenplay adaptation for the big screen of the two stories in \"Seventy Times Seven\", that were joined to assemble the frame for the homonymous film directed by [[Leopoldo Torre Nilson]] (1962).

After this onset, Sáenz won the Award of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] in Spanish, in 1963, with his storybook \"No\".

The same year, he won the award Argentores by the Sociedad Argentina de Autores with \"Thirty Thirty\", a tale raised in the manner of an American western, but located in Patagonia.

In 1964 he published in the Editorial Emecé \"The Necessary Sin\", a novel that was later adapted to create the script for the film version, called  \"Nobody heard Cecilio Fuentes scream \" directed by Fernando Siro, and winner of the Silver Shell (Concha de Plata) in the International Film Festival of San Sebastian, Spain (1965).
Then he began to write plays and very soon he was awarded the prize “Casa de las Américas”, in Cuba in 1966, with \"Hip Hip Ufa\", published by Editorial Emecé, and was adapted to create the script for the film version with the title \"Ufa with sex\" under the direction of Rodolfo Kuhn -1972. Then he worked again in its adaptation with Pablo Silva, for the well-known play \"Sex, Lies and Money\" (Bs As. 2002/3).

According to his statements, Sáenz took literary vacations between books by writing small books of humor, which were very successful. Among them stands out \"I Also Was A [[Spermatozoid]]\" published by the editorial Torres Agüero. 
Then began an intimate and detailed description of the feminine universe, with a vision that is surprising and original, and promptly became a bestseller titled \"Open Letter To My Future Ex-wife\" published by editorial Emecé in 1968, and re-edited several times, until the last version in 1999. Saenz is an author who can capture the essence of the feminine sensibility, characters that he treats with a great deal of tenderness.

His next play \"Who me?\" was published in 1969 and re-edited by Gargoyle editions in 2004, was played almost without interruption since its publication, and it became a classic of the absurd in the Argentine theater scene. He also worked as a screenwriter for various characters, including one for comic actor [[Luis Sandrini]] in the film \"Kuma-ching\", under the direction of Daniel Tinayre.

When the military dictatorship happened in Argentina between 1976 and 1983- Sáenz received death threats and had to leave the country to exile, and after touring for a while, he settled in Punta del Este, Uruguay. During that period he didn’t write at all.

He returns in 1983 with the historical novel \"El Argentinazo\", winning the “Faja de Honor” of the SADE (Sociedad Argentina de Escritores) that later would become a play, in which he worked together with Francisco Javier, director of the piece, in its adaptation, staged by his group Los Volatineros (The Acrobats) at the Cervantes National Theatre in 1985.

Then he returns to police stories, already hinted in his early tales, with \"On His Open Eyelids Walked A Fly\" a novel of 1986, that also turned into a theatrical version, written by Saenz and entitled “The Boludas\", also turned into a film. And \"the Satyr of The Roaring Laugh\" based on real events.

Later on, he began to investigate the Dead Sea Scrolls and the figure of [[Jesus Christ]] in association with Dr. Alberto Cormillot. They traveled together through Israel, Egypt, and New York, interviewing personalities related to the subject, and all of this led to the publication of \"Christ standing\" (Editorial Planeta 1995 and 1998).

Later he continues its unique, human, erotic, and poetic vision of the Argentine [[caudillo]]s in his historical novels \"The Wrong Patria\" (Editorial Planeta, 1991), \" White Malón \" (Editorial Emecé 1995) and \"My Forgetfulness / O what General Paz Didn’t Said In His Memoirs \"(1998, Editorial Sudamericana).

In 2004 he published \"As A Writer\" with some formulas on how he wrote his best stories, and the novel \"Pastor Of Bats\" (Gárgola Ediciones, 2005)

Many of his works have been translated and published in different languages, and his stories show up in numerous compilations, as in \"Latin Blood\" by Donald Yates (The best crime and detective stories of South America / Editorial Herder and Herder New York 1972); or \"The Best Patagonian Narrations\" by Mary Belts & Cristian Aliaga, Editorial Ameghino Buenos Aires 1988, among others.
He currently lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he works as a writer, coordinates its literary workshop and also makes cultural commentaries on the radio, in addition to writing articles as free-lance for the most prestigious newspapers and magazines. A prolific writer and author of numerous bestselling, the plays of Dalmiro Sáenz are among the most represented in Argentina. His style is characterized by a relentless sarcasm accompanied by a hilarity that reaches absurdity.

He died on 11 September 2016 at the age of 90.<ref>[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/221446/writer-of-acerbic-works-dalmiro-sÃƒÂ¡enz-dies Writer of acerbic works Dalmiro Sáenz dies]</ref>

'''''Red Storm Rising''''' is a [[simulation video game]] based on [[Tom Clancy]]'s novel ''[[Red Storm Rising]]'' and released in 1988 by [[MicroProse]]. The player is put in charge of an American [[SSN (U.S. Navy)|SSN]] submarine in the [[Norwegian Sea]] Theater with the overall role of a [[Attack submarine|hunter killer]] performing various missions in the context of the global conflict described in the book representing a campaign. Its original [[Commodore 64]] version was co-designed and co-programmed by the famous game designer [[Sid Meier]].

==Plot==
As with {{USS|Chicago|SSN-721|6}} in the book, the game concentrates on the [[Norwegian Sea]] theater, placing the player as captain of a single [[United States Navy]] [[nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]] tasked to disrupt [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in the area between the [[Kola Peninsula]] and the Greenland-Iceland-UK barrier. Missions may include interdiction of [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] fleets, stopping amphibious landing forces, eliminating Soviet [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf pack]] submarines and many others. The background story remains true to the book's plot but the final mission is always to prevent the Soviets from launching nuclear missiles by locating and eliminating their [[ballistic missile submarine]]s.

==Gameplay==
The player may choose from four different timelines. Starting in the early 1980s limits the player to [[Thresher/Permit-class submarine|''Permit'']], {{sclass-|Sturgeon|submarine|5}} or early {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|5}}-class submarines, but the Soviets have weak [[sonar]], whereas starting in the late 1980s allows the player to use the improved ''Los Angeles'' class and even the newer {{sclass-|Seawolf|submarine|5}} subs. Weapons improve accordingly, with [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk missiles]] and improved [[Mark 48 torpedo]]es included in later timelines but the Soviets begin deploying [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[aircraft carrier]]s and much better [[anti-submarine warfare]] ships.

The goal of the game is always consistent: Inflicting as much damage as possible on the Soviets in the Norwegian Sea, thus allowing safe passage to supply [[convoy]]s coming from America and preventing amphibious forces from conquering Norway and Iceland. In order to make contact with enemy forces, the player must navigate the sub in a map of the North Sea, depending on his sub's sensors as well as allied aircraft, satellites and [[SOSUS]] arrays to detect the Soviet forces.

Success or failure of the missions impacts the progress of the war depicted by shifts in the front line on a simple map of Europe. If the player fails in a mission then Soviet forces capture more territory, but if he succeeds then [[NATO]] is able to resist the Soviet attacks. In the course of the campaign the player can gain rank and possibly earn medals as well. In the end of the war, a final score is calculated and the player is awarded a post-war rank if NATO wins the war; this rank can vary from [[commander]] to [[admiral]] depending on how successful they have been in their missions. A poor performance in the game, particularly in the final mission, means that the Soviets win the war and the player ends up with the rank of [[Comrade#Russian usage|Tovarishch]] (comrade), becoming a political prisoner in a communist-ruled America.

'''Juan Gabriel Cotino Ferrer''' (26 January 1950 &ndash; 13 April 2020), known as '''Juan Cotino''', was an entrepreneur and Spanish politician of the Popular Party.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Xirivella]], [[Valencia]]. Coming from a family of agricultural entrepreneurs, he was one of the founders of the Valencian Association of Farmers. In 1976, he joined the UCD, becoming part of the Popular Democratic Party and later the [[People's Party (Spain)|Popular Party]]. In 1991, he was elected councilman in the City of Valencia, to the position of deputy mayor, being reelected in 1995.

==Political career==

In 2007, he was named third vice-president of the Valencian Community and counselor of Social Welfare, a portfolio that changes by Environment in 2009, maintaining the vice-presidency.

'''Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia''' ({{lang-ru|Иоанн Константинович}}; 5 July 1886 – 18 July 1918), sometimes also known as '''Prince John''', '''Prince Ivan''' or '''Prince Johan,''' was the eldest son of [[Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia]] by his wife, Yelizaveta Mavrikievna, née [[Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg (1865–1927)|Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg]]. He was described by contemporaries as a gentle, religious person, nicknamed \"Ioannchik\" by his relatives.

==Early life==
[[File:Imperial Monogram of Prince John Constantinovich of Russia.svg|thumb|100px|left|Imperial Monogram of Prince Ioann Konstantinovich]]

Ioann Konstantinovich was born as a [[Grand Duke of Russia]] with the style [[Imperial Highness]], but at the age of 9 days, a [[Ukaz]] of his cousin Emperor [[Alexander III of Russia]] stripped him of that title, as the Ukaz amended the House Law by limiting the grand-ducal title to grandsons of a reigning emperor. As a result, he received the title [[List of Princes of Russia|Prince of the Imperial Blood]] (Prince of Russia) with the style [[Highness]].

He once entertained the possibility of becoming an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[monk]], but eventually fell in love with [[Princess Helen of Serbia]]. They married on 2 September 1911, and Helen took the name Princess Yelena Petrovna of Russia. They had a son, [[Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia|Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich]] (20 January 1914 &ndash; 18 June 1973), and a daughter, [[Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia|Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna]] (12 July 1915 &ndash; 13 March 2007), who was the last member of the Imperial Family to be born before the fall of the dynasty, and was ultimately to become the last surviving uncontested dynast of the [[House of Romanov|Imperial House of Russia]].

==Revolution and death==
Prince Ioann fought in the [[First World War]], was decorated as a war hero, and was at the front when the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] started. In April 1918 he was exiled to the [[Urals]] by the [[Bolsheviks]], and later murdered in July the same year in a mineshaft near [[Alapayevsk]], along with his brothers [[Prince Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia|Prince Konstantin Konstantinovich]] and [[Prince Igor Konstantinovich of Russia|Prince Igor Konstantinovich]], his cousin [[Vladimir Paley|Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley]], and other relatives and friends.

His body was eventually buried in [[Beijing]], in the cemetery of the Russian Orthodox Mission, which was destroyed in 1986 to build a park. His sister [[Princess Vera Konstantinovna of Russia|Princess Vera Konstantinovna]], mother [[Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg (1865–1927)|Grand Duchess Yelizaveta Mavrikievna]] and wife Princess Yelena Petrovna left Russia in April 1919 with help from the King of Norway. His daughter Princess Yekaterina married Ruggero, Marquis Farace di Villaforesta (a descendant of the [[House of Medici|Medici]] family of Florence). Yekaterina lived in [[Buenos Aires]] and later in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] where she died in 2007. His sister Princess Vera Konstantinovna, the youngest daughter of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich, died in New York in 2001, aged 94.

'''Rad21''', also known as '''Scc1''' or '''Mcd1''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''RAD21'' [[gene]].<ref name=\"entrez\">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: RAD21 RAD21 homolog (S. pombe)| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=5885| accessdate = }}</ref> 

Rad21 is the kleisin subunit of the [[Cohesin]] complex which mediates [[Establishment of sister chromatid cohesion|sister chromatid cohesion]], homologous recombination and [[Topologically associating domain|DNA looping]]. Cohesin is formed of SMC3, [[SMC1A|SMC1]], [[RAD21]] and either [[STAG1|SA1]] or [[STAG2|SA2]]. Cleavage of Rad21 by the cysteine protease [[Separase]] results in sister chromatid separation during the metaphase to anaphase transition. 

Rad21 was separately discovered in budding yeast by [[Douglas Koshland]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guacci |first1=V |last2=Koshland |first2=D |last3=Strunnikov |first3=A |title=A direct link between sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation revealed through the analysis of MCD1 in S. cerevisiae. |journal=Cell |date=3 October 1997 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=47-57 |doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(01)80008-8 |pmid=9335334}}</ref> and [[Kim Nasmyth]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Michaelis |first1=C |last2=Ciosk |first2=R |last3=Nasmyth |first3=K |title=Cohesins: chromosomal proteins that prevent premature separation of sister chromatids. |journal=Cell |date=3 October 1997 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=35-45 |doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(01)80007-6 |pmid=9335333}}</ref> Like the other cohesin subunits ''RAD21'' is frequently mutated in a range of cancers <ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Koninck |first1=M |last2=Losada |first2=A |title=Cohesin Mutations in Cancer. |journal=Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine |date=1 December 2016 |volume=6 |issue=12 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a026476 |pmid=27742736}}</ref> and several other disorders.

'''Rad21''', also known as '''Scc1''' or '''Mcd1''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''RAD21'' [[gene]].<ref name=\"entrez\">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: RAD21 RAD21 homolog (S. pombe)| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=5885| accessdate = }}</ref> 

Rad21 is the kleisin subunit of the [[Cohesin]] complex which mediates sister chromatid cohesion, homologous recombination and DNA looping. Cohesin is formed of Smc3, Smc1, Rad21 and either SA1 or SA2. Cleavage of Rad21 by the cysteine protease [[Separase]] results in sister chromatid separation during the metaphase to anaphase transition.

Rad21 was separately discovered in budding yeast by [[Douglas Koshland]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guacci |first1=V |last2=Koshland |first2=D |last3=Strunnikov |first3=A |title=A direct link between sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation revealed through the analysis of MCD1 in S. cerevisiae. |journal=Cell |date=3 October 1997 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=47-57 |doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(01)80008-8 |pmid=9335334}}</ref> and [[Kim Nasmyth]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Michaelis |first1=C |last2=Ciosk |first2=R |last3=Nasmyth |first3=K |title=Cohesins: chromosomal proteins that prevent premature separation of sister chromatids. |journal=Cell |date=3 October 1997 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=35-45 |doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(01)80007-6 |pmid=9335333}}</ref> Like the other cohesin subunits ''RAD21'' is frequently mutated in a range of cancers <ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Koninck |first1=M |last2=Losada |first2=A |title=Cohesin Mutations in Cancer. |journal=Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine |date=1 December 2016 |volume=6 |issue=12 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a026476 |pmid=27742736}}</ref> and several other disorders.
