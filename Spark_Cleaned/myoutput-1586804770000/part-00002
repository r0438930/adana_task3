Bellisario, served for four years in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and after having worked his way up through advertising jobs, he landed his first network television job as a story editor for the World War II-era series ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', where he got a habit of promoting a consistent promilitary stance in a business where he got the perception that \"antiwar\" and \"antisoldier\" mentality were the commonplace.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 127.</ref> The stereotype in the post-[[Vietnam war]] era of \"[[Vietnam Veteran#Negative stereotypes of Vietnam veterans and efforts to overcome|crazed Vietnam veterans]]\" was notably subverted, by not just one, but three of the main characters, in ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'', of which Bellisario was the co-creator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/> \nFollowing the cancellation of his series ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', Bellisario began working on a one-shot screenplay of a murder mystery aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, where the victim was a female aviator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\nThe issue of whether or not to expand the options for women serving in the U.S. armed forces as fighter pilots and in other frontline assignments was a contentious social issue of the day. In 1991, a famous incident had occurred at the [[Tailhook Association]] [[Tailhook scandal|convention in Las Vegas]], where male naval aviators had behaved in manners inappropriate, if not criminal.  The follow-up criminal and other investigations by the [[Naval Investigative Service|then-named NIS]], the [[Naval Inspector General]], and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, were later heavily criticized by the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense]].  The  [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Acting Secretary of the Navy]] [[Sean O'Keefe]], to whom the report was delivered, agreed with the findings and began to take corrective action with respect to both the perceived attitude problems towards women and the functions of the investigative arms of the Department of the Navy.<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1992-09-24 | title = Defense Department News Briefing | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193630/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\nThe fallout from the incident resulted in a hard blow to the [[Naval aviation|naval aviation community]], where the promotions of many [[naval aviator]]s were put on hold. The common counterclaim from the other side of the aisle, as articulated by former Secretary of the Navy in the [[Reagan administration]] and [[naval flight officer]] [[John F. Lehman]], was that the naval aviation community had been unfairly subjected to a witch-hunt motivated by [[political correctness]], in effect killing its ''esprit de corps'', and by extension damaging its combat effectiveness.<ref name=\"Lehman:372\">[[#Lehman|Lehman]]: p. 372.</ref> During the [[Clinton administration]] in April 1993, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Les Aspin]] announced a new policy, which in effect made it possible to have female fighter pilots serving on aircraft carriers at sea and in other new positions (but still prohibited from serving in [[infantry]], etc.)\n<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1993-04-28 | title = Women in Combat (Department of Defense briefing) | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193631/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\nThus, the stage was set for the reality-based fictional drama, when Bellisario read in a newspaper about the forthcoming introduction of female fighter pilots on aircraft carriers.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\nWhile doing research on which organizational entities would partake in investigative efforts of crimes committed aboard Naval vessels, Bellisario found  the special agents of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] filled the police role, and the uniformed lawyers, in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, could alternate between the role of defense attorney, prosecutor, and field investigator. Bellisario chose to go ahead with the lawyers and remarked season six about the unique advantages it brought from a story-telling point of view: \"Unlike most [[legal drama|law shows]], I've got a detective, a prosecutor, and a defender.\"<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with the military===\n[[File:RADM Donald Guter, JAGC, USN visited the JAG television series set, 2001-02-20.jpg|thumb|The then-[[Judge Advocate General of the Navy]], Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter (second from left), visiting the set, meeting with the cast during the shooting of \"[[JAG (season 6)#ep128|Liberty]]\" in 2001]]\n\nInitially, the producers of ''JAG'' did not receive any co-operation from the Department of the Navy, due to sensitivity in light of all the accumulative negative publicity that had been generated from the [[Tailhook scandal]] and its aftermath.<ref name=\"Erickson:129\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 129.</ref> However, the lack of co-operation from the military was not a show-stopper, as the ''JAG'' production team, by virtue of being a [[Paramount Pictures]] production, had access to the [[stock footage]] of the motion pictures owned by the studio, which included many films with military content, such as ''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]'', ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]].<ref name=\"Erickson:128\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 128.</ref>\n\nIn 1997, though, the naval services had begun to change their minds, and began to render support to the production team on a script-by-script basis. A primetime network series about Navy lawyers bringing out controversial subjects in a very public arena was apparently no longer an issue in itself, but as noted by Commander Bob Anderson of the Navy's [[Public affairs (military)|entertainment media liaison office]] in Los Angeles in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview: \"We're fine with that as long as the bad guys are caught and punished, and the institution of the Navy is not the bad guy\".<ref name=\"Erickson:129\"/>\n\n===Ships===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nAlmost all episodes of the series feature scenes filmed aboard real United States Navy ships. The ship most widely used was {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}, in commission as a training carrier at the time. Most of the ''Nimitz''-class carriers also appear in one or several episodes. {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, and {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} were also used in the series.\n\nUSS ''Enterprise'' was used as the fictional USS ''Seahawk'' in many episodes. USS ''Forrestal'' and {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|6}} were also used as the fictional ''Seahawk'', both in season four and for one episode each. For scenes filmed aboard ''Enterprise'', the whole crew wore caps reading ''USS Seahawk \u2013 CVN 65'' so they matched the ship's real hull number.\n\nUSS ''Forrestal'' was featured in many episodes, most prominently two in which she portrayed the fictional USS ''Reprisal''.  In these episodes, all crew members wore caps with the ''CV-35'' pennant number.  This number was intentionally out of sequence with the pennant numbers of active USN carriers at the time the series was filmed. CV-35 would have been the real pennant number of an ''Essex''-class carrier actually called ''Reprisal'', which was canceled during construction in 1945 when World War II ended, and broken up in 1949 after consideration had been given to completing her to a revised design roughly similar to that of {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}}.\n\nOnly six USN ships featured in the series were called by their real names: {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}, {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}, {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}, {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}, {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}}, and {{USS|Belknap|CG-26|6}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' is mentioned in one of the season-three episodes, but never seen on screen. ''America'' is the murder scene in a season-three episode, but shots supposedly depicting her are in fact shots of ''Forrestal''. Real shots of ''Theodore Roosevelt'' in harbor are used in one episode of season one.\n\n[[File:US Navy 050125-N-0685S-001 Crewmembers for the hit television show JAG set up for the next shot outside the Transient Aircraft Line on board Naval Air Station North Island, Calif.jpg|thumb|upright|Crewmembers set up for a shot at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS North Island]] (2005)]]\n\nSeason-three opener \"Ghost Ship\" was filmed entirely aboard ''Hornet'' while she was laid up at Alameda Naval Air Station before being preserved as a museum ship. Part of the storyline in \"Ghost Ship\" deals with the final fate of ''Hornet''. It implies (though not explicitly stating it) she was eventually scrapped due to severe fire damage sustained during the course of the episode, contrary to her real-life fate as a national landmark. The subplot in \"Ghost Ship\" indicating that the ship's double hull had to be cut open from the inside to repair supposed damage to her bow during Vietnam was not at all correct with her service record.\n\n''Coral Sea'' is also featured in the season-three episode \"Vanished\" and season-four episodes \"Angels 30\" and \"Shakedown\". As she had already been scrapped at the time the episodes supposedly took place, archival footage of ''Coral Sea'' was used, with other footage shot aboard ''Forrestal''. The majority of the exterior scenes from \"Angels 30\" were filmed aboard ''Forrestal'' and a few aboard ''Enterprise''.\n\n''Belknap'' is mentioned in the season-four episode \"Going after Francesca\" as the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] flagship, a role she actually fulfilled in real life from 1986 until her decommissioning in 1994. ''Belknap'' had already been decommissioned and was laid up awaiting scrapping when the episode was filmed, allowing for actual exterior shots of the ship to be featured in the episode.\n\nThe series also includes appearances by {{sclass-|Tarawa|amphibious assault ship|1}}s, {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s, {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s (in particular {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}} itself during the opening credit montage), and {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|1}}s. In one of the episodes, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] frigate {{ship|Spanish frigate|Santa Mar\u00eda||2}} is used to depict a fictional USN ''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class ship (denoted by her NATO pennant number \"F 81\" painted under the bridge, instead of the U.S. practice of having a \"number only\" ID painted on the bow).\n\nWhile most sea episodes are focused on aviation missions, several are based around submarine warfare: namely episodes 1:3, 2:6, 4:16, 5:22, 6:15, 7:14, 7:24, 8:7, 8:17, and 9:7.\n\n===Series end===\n[[File:JAGcoin.png|thumb|right|Harm (David James Elliott) and Mac (Catherine Bell) use a challenge coin to determine who will resign his or her commission.]]\nIn February 2005, David James Elliott announced he would leave the show at the end of the 10th season; the show was subsequently not renewed for an 11th season by the network.<ref name=\"Why JAG\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title=Why 'JAG' came to an abrupt end|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 29, 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052549/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show also introduced new younger characters, including former ''[[As the World Turns]]'' star [[Chris Beetem]], and [[Jordana Spiro]] from ''[[The Huntress (TV series)|The Huntress]]''.\n\nThe producers also considered relocating the fictional setting of the show, from Falls Church to [[Naval Base San Diego]]. An episode of the final season, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep222|JAG: San Diego]]\" had the main cast, excluding Harm, going to the San Diego naval base and working with the local JAG office there. Though it was reportedly considered as a pilot episode, as a reformat of the show aiming for a younger audience, CBS ultimately decided not to pursue a new series.\n\nNevertheless, CBS announced the cancellation of the show on April 4, 2005, after 10 seasons. The final episode, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep227|Fair Winds and Following Seas]]\", aired on April 29, 2005, and in which Harm and Mac are assigned different [[Military base|stations]]: Harm in [[London]], Mac in [[San Diego]]. They finally confront their feelings and decide to get married. The episode ends with Bud tossing a [[challenge coin]] to decide which one would give up his or her military career to be with the other. However, in keeping with ''JAG'' tradition, the outcome of the toss is never seen, as the screen fades to black, showing only the coin, which bears the inscription \"1995 \u2013 2005\", the years the series spanned.\n\nWhat happened is later revealed in the 2019 finale of the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|tenth season]] of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', ''\"False Flag\"'', in which David James Elliott and Catherine Bell both appeared. Mac won the coin toss and Harm resigned his commission and moved with her to San Diego, but later they mutually ended their relationship and Harm rejoined the Navy and is currently serving as the [[Executive officer|XO]] of the (fictional) aircraft carrier, ''USS Allegiance''. Mac left the Marines to serve as Marine Liaison to the Secretary of State, a civilian position. Harm and Mac had not seen each other in 9 years until video conferencing with each other in their new roles. In the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 11)|eleventh season]] premiere, Harm and Mac reunite in person, share an embrace, and later renew a discussion of their relationship, once again without reaching a conclusion.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Nielsen ratings===\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of ''JAG'' on NBC (first season) and CBS (other seasons).\n: Note: U.S. network television seasons generally start in late September and end in late May, which coincides with the completion of the May [[sweeps]].\n\n{| style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The two episodes, titled \"[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]\" and \"[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]\", focused on the NCIS team, with most of the JAG regulars as supporting characters. Whereas the episodes of ''JAG'' are primarily oriented on a mixture of courtroom drama and military activities in the field, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' episodes are more focused, as the meaning of  the acronym suggests, on criminal investigations. ''NCIS'' also follows a different storytelling format from ''JAG'', emphasizing character humor to a larger extent than its parent program. ''NCIS'' later produced its own spin-offs, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', which shows a further departure from the styles and themes of ''JAG''.\n\nThe two episodes \"Ice Queen\" and \"Meltdown\" were edited down to a one-hour pilot film, which was then used to sell the idea of ''NCIS'' as a new series to CBS; the pilot used the title, \"NCIS \u2013 The Beginning\". It was later also used to introduce the show to CBS affiliates and advertisers.  It was only broadcast once and is not available on home video.\n\nExcluding the backdoor pilot, few major characters from ''JAG'' have appeared in the ''NCIS'' series. Patrick Labyorteaux appeared briefly as Lieutenant Bud Roberts in the ''NCIS'' first-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep2|Hung Out to Dry]]\", and again \u2013 now with the rank of captain \u2013 in the season fourteen episode \"Rogue,\" advising the NCIS team on a legal issue. [[John M. Jackson]] returned in May 2013 as retired Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, now a civilian attorney in the private sector hired by [[List of NCIS characters#Leon Vance|Director Vance]] to provide legal representation for [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Special Agent Gibbs]], in the season ten ''NCIS'' finale, \"[[Damned If You Do (NCIS)|Damned If You Do]]\".<ref name=tl>{{cite web|last=Roots|first=Kimberly|title=NCIS Exclusive: A JAG Favorite to Return in This Season's 'Nail-Biter' of a Finale|url=http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 12, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043344/http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Jackson has recurred as A.J.

The character of [[U.S. Senator]] Edward Sheffield ([[Dean Stockwell]]), who appeared in three episodes of that show, later became a recurring character on ''JAG'' as the new [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], starting in season eight.\n\n===''Yes, Dear'' tribute===\nThe sitcom ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' did an episode called \"Let's Get Jaggy With It\" where Greg's father Tom ([[Tim Conway]]) wins a walk-on role on ''JAG''. Catherine Bell guest-starred as herself while David James Elliott, Patrick Labyorteaux, and Scott Lawrence guest-starred as their respective ''JAG'' characters.\n\n==Home media==\nOn September 1, 1998, the pilot episode of ''JAG'' was released on [[VHS]] cassette in the U.S. by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]].

Bellisario, served for four years in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and after having worked his way up through advertising jobs, he landed his first network television job as a story editor for the World War II-era series ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', where he got a habit of promoting a consistent promilitary stance in a business where he got the perception that \"antiwar\" and \"antisoldier\" mentality were the commonplace.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 127.</ref> The stereotype in the post-[[Vietnam war]] era of \"[[Vietnam Veteran#Negative stereotypes of Vietnam veterans and efforts to overcome|crazed Vietnam veterans]]\" was notably subverted, by not just one, but three of the main characters, in ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'', of which Bellisario was the co-creator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/> \nFollowing the cancellation of his series ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', Bellisario began working on a one-shot screenplay of a murder mystery aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, where the victim was a female aviator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\nThe issue of whether or not to expand the options for women serving in the U.S. armed forces as fighter pilots and in other frontline assignments was a contentious social issue of the day. In 1991, a famous incident had occurred at the [[Tailhook Association]] [[Tailhook scandal|convention in Las Vegas]], where male naval aviators had behaved in manners inappropriate, if not criminal.  The follow-up criminal and other investigations by the [[Naval Investigative Service|then-named NIS]], the [[Naval Inspector General]], and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, were later heavily criticized by the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense]].  The  [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Acting Secretary of the Navy]] [[Sean O'Keefe]], to whom the report was delivered, agreed with the findings and began to take corrective action with respect to both the perceived attitude problems towards women and the functions of the investigative arms of the Department of the Navy.<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1992-09-24 | title = Defense Department News Briefing | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193630/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\nThe fallout from the incident resulted in a hard blow to the [[Naval aviation|naval aviation community]], where the promotions of many [[naval aviator]]s were put on hold. The common counterclaim from the other side of the aisle, as articulated by former Secretary of the Navy in the [[Reagan administration]] and [[naval flight officer]] [[John F. Lehman]], was that the naval aviation community had been unfairly subjected to a witch-hunt motivated by [[political correctness]], in effect killing its ''esprit de corps'', and by extension damaging its combat effectiveness.<ref name=\"Lehman:372\">[[#Lehman|Lehman]]: p. 372.</ref> During the [[Clinton administration]] in April 1993, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Les Aspin]] announced a new policy, which in effect made it possible to have female fighter pilots serving on aircraft carriers at sea and in other new positions (but still prohibited from serving in [[infantry]], etc.)\n<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1993-04-28 | title = Women in Combat (Department of Defense briefing) | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193631/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\nThus, the stage was set for the reality-based fictional drama, when Bellisario read in a newspaper about the forthcoming introduction of female fighter pilots on aircraft carriers.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\nWhile doing research on which organizational entities would partake in investigative efforts of crimes committed aboard Naval vessels, Bellisario found  the special agents of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] filled the police role, and the uniformed lawyers, in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, could alternate between the role of defense attorney, prosecutor, and field investigator. Bellisario chose to go ahead with the lawyers and remarked season six about the unique advantages it brought from a story-telling point of view: \"Unlike most [[legal drama|law shows]], I've got a detective, a prosecutor, and a defender.\"<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with the military===\n[[File:RADM Donald Guter, JAGC, USN visited the JAG television series set, 2001-02-20.jpg|thumb|The then-[[Judge Advocate General of the Navy]], Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter (second from left), visiting the set, meeting with the cast during the shooting of \"[[JAG (season 6)#ep128|Liberty]]\" in 2001]]\n\nInitially, the producers of ''JAG'' did not receive any co-operation from the Department of the Navy, due to sensitivity in light of all the accumulative negative publicity that had been generated from the [[Tailhook scandal]] and its aftermath.<ref name=\"Erickson:129\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 129.</ref> However, the lack of co-operation from the military was not a show-stopper, as the ''JAG'' production team, by virtue of being a [[Paramount Pictures]] production, had access to the [[stock footage]] of the motion pictures owned by the studio, which included many films with military content, such as ''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]'', ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]].<ref name=\"Erickson:128\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 128.</ref>\n\nIn 1997, though, the naval services had begun to change their minds, and began to render support to the production team on a script-by-script basis. A primetime network series about Navy lawyers bringing out controversial subjects in a very public arena was apparently no longer an issue in itself, but as noted by Commander Bob Anderson of the Navy's [[Public affairs (military)|entertainment media liaison office]] in Los Angeles in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview: \"We're fine with that as long as the bad guys are caught and punished, and the institution of the Navy is not the bad guy\".<ref name=\"Erickson:129\"/>\n\n===Ships===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nAlmost all episodes of the series feature scenes filmed aboard real United States Navy ships. The ship most widely used was {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}, in commission as a training carrier at the time. Most of the ''Nimitz''-class carriers also appear in one or several episodes. {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, and {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} were also used in the series.\n\nUSS ''Enterprise'' was used as the fictional USS ''Seahawk'' in many episodes. USS ''Forrestal'' and {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|6}} were also used as the fictional ''Seahawk'', both in season four and for one episode each. For scenes filmed aboard ''Enterprise'', the whole crew wore caps reading ''USS Seahawk \u2013 CVN 65'' so they matched the ship's real hull number.\n\nUSS ''Forrestal'' was featured in many episodes, most prominently two in which she portrayed the fictional USS ''Reprisal''.  In these episodes, all crew members wore caps with the ''CV-35'' pennant number.  This number was intentionally out of sequence with the pennant numbers of active USN carriers at the time the series was filmed. CV-35 would have been the real pennant number of an ''Essex''-class carrier actually called ''Reprisal'', which was canceled during construction in 1945 when World War II ended, and broken up in 1949 after consideration had been given to completing her to a revised design roughly similar to that of {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}}.\n\nOnly six USN ships featured in the series were called by their real names: {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}, {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}, {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}, {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}, {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}}, and {{USS|Belknap|CG-26|6}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' is mentioned in one of the season-three episodes, but never seen on screen. ''America'' is the murder scene in a season-three episode, but shots supposedly depicting her are in fact shots of ''Forrestal''. Real shots of ''Theodore Roosevelt'' in harbor are used in one episode of season one.\n\n[[File:US Navy 050125-N-0685S-001 Crewmembers for the hit television show JAG set up for the next shot outside the Transient Aircraft Line on board Naval Air Station North Island, Calif.jpg|thumb|upright|Crewmembers set up for a shot at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS North Island]] (2005)]]\n\nSeason-three opener \"Ghost Ship\" was filmed entirely aboard ''Hornet'' while she was laid up at Alameda Naval Air Station before being preserved as a museum ship. Part of the storyline in \"Ghost Ship\" deals with the final fate of ''Hornet''. It implies (though not explicitly stating it) she was eventually scrapped due to severe fire damage sustained during the course of the episode, contrary to her real-life fate as a national landmark. The subplot in \"Ghost Ship\" indicating that the ship's double hull had to be cut open from the inside to repair supposed damage to her bow during Vietnam was not at all correct with her service record.\n\n''Coral Sea'' is also featured in the season-three episode \"Vanished\" and season-four episodes \"Angels 30\" and \"Shakedown\". As she had already been scrapped at the time the episodes supposedly took place, archival footage of ''Coral Sea'' was used, with other footage shot aboard ''Forrestal''. The majority of the exterior scenes from \"Angels 30\" were filmed aboard ''Forrestal'' and a few aboard ''Enterprise''.\n\n''Belknap'' is mentioned in the season-four episode \"Going after Francesca\" as the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] flagship, a role she actually fulfilled in real life from 1986 until her decommissioning in 1994. ''Belknap'' had already been decommissioned and was laid up awaiting scrapping when the episode was filmed, allowing for actual exterior shots of the ship to be featured in the episode.\n\nThe series also includes appearances by {{sclass-|Tarawa|amphibious assault ship|1}}s, {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s, {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s (in particular {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}} itself during the opening credit montage), and {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|1}}s. In one of the episodes, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] frigate {{ship|Spanish frigate|Santa Mar\u00eda||2}} is used to depict a fictional USN ''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class ship (denoted by her NATO pennant number \"F 81\" painted under the bridge, instead of the U.S. practice of having a \"number only\" ID painted on the bow).\n\nWhile most sea episodes are focused on aviation missions, several are based around submarine warfare: namely episodes 1:3, 2:6, 4:16, 5:22, 6:15, 7:14, 7:24, 8:7, 8:17, and 9:7.\n\n===Series end===\n[[File:JAGcoin.png|thumb|right|Harm (David James Elliott) and Mac (Catherine Bell) use a challenge coin to determine who will resign his or her commission.]]\nIn February 2005, David James Elliott announced he would leave the show at the end of the 10th season; the show was subsequently not renewed for an 11th season by the network.<ref name=\"Why JAG\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title=Why 'JAG' came to an abrupt end|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 29, 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052549/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show also introduced new younger characters, including former ''[[As the World Turns]]'' star [[Chris Beetem]], and [[Jordana Spiro]] from ''[[The Huntress (TV series)|The Huntress]]''.\n\nThe producers also considered relocating the fictional setting of the show, from Falls Church to [[Naval Base San Diego]]. An episode of the final season, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep222|JAG: San Diego]]\" had the main cast, excluding Harm, going to the San Diego naval base and working with the local JAG office there. Though it was reportedly considered as a pilot episode, as a reformat of the show aiming for a younger audience, CBS ultimately decided not to pursue a new series.\n\nNevertheless, CBS announced the cancellation of the show on April 4, 2005, after 10 seasons. The final episode, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep227|Fair Winds and Following Seas]]\", aired on April 29, 2005, and in which Harm and Mac are assigned different [[Military base|stations]]: Harm in [[London]], Mac in [[San Diego]]. They finally confront their feelings and decide to get married. The episode ends with Bud tossing a [[challenge coin]] to decide which one would give up his or her military career to be with the other. However, in keeping with ''JAG'' tradition, the outcome of the toss is never seen, as the screen fades to black, showing only the coin, which bears the inscription \"1995 \u2013 2005\", the years the series spanned.\n\nWhat happened is later revealed in the 2019 finale of the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|tenth season]] of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', ''\"False Flag\"'', in which David James Elliott and Catherine Bell both appeared. Mac won the coin toss and Harm resigned his commission and moved with her to San Diego, but later they mutually ended their relationship and Harm rejoined the Navy and is currently serving as the [[Executive officer|XO]] of the (fictional) aircraft carrier, ''USS Allegiance''. Mac left the Marines to serve as Marine Liaison to the Secretary of State, a civilian position. Harm and Mac had not seen each other in 9 years until video conferencing with each other in their new roles. In the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 11)|eleventh season]] premiere, Harm and Mac reunite in person, share an embrace, and later renew a discussion of their relationship, once again without reaching a conclusion.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Nielsen ratings===\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of ''JAG'' on NBC (first season) and CBS (other seasons).\n: Note: U.S. network television seasons generally start in late September and end in late May, which coincides with the completion of the May [[sweeps]].\n\n{| style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Bellisario was developing a ''JAG'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]],  around the work of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]].<ref name=\"Variety20030113\">{{cite web|title=CBS \u2018Angel\u2019 to fly home \u2013 Net also eyes 'JAG' spinoff|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=January 13, 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033839/http://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was aired in April 2003 in a two-part [[backdoor pilot]] in which Commander Rabb is arrested, but later vindicated as innocent, for the murder of Lieutenant Singer. The two episodes, titled \"[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]\" and \"[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]\", focused on the NCIS team, with most of the JAG regulars as supporting characters. Whereas the episodes of ''JAG'' are primarily oriented on a mixture of courtroom drama and military activities in the field, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' episodes are more focused, as the meaning of  the acronym suggests, on criminal investigations. ''NCIS'' also follows a different storytelling format from ''JAG'', emphasizing character humor to a larger extent than its parent program. ''NCIS'' later produced its own spin-offs, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', which shows a further departure from the styles and themes of ''JAG''.\n\nThe two episodes \"Ice Queen\" and \"Meltdown\" were edited down to a one-hour pilot film, which was then used to sell the idea of ''NCIS'' as a new series to CBS; the pilot used the title, \"NCIS \u2013 The Beginning\". It was later also used to introduce the show to CBS affiliates and advertisers.  It was only broadcast once and is not available on home video.\n\nExcluding the backdoor pilot, few major characters from ''JAG'' have appeared in the ''NCIS'' series. Patrick Labyorteaux appeared briefly as Lieutenant Bud Roberts in the ''NCIS'' first-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep2|Hung Out to Dry]]\", and again \u2013 now with the rank of captain \u2013 in the season fourteen episode \"Rogue,\" advising the NCIS team on a legal issue. [[John M. Jackson]] returned in May 2013 as retired Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, now a civilian attorney in the private sector hired by [[List of NCIS characters#Leon Vance|Director Vance]] to provide legal representation for [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Special Agent Gibbs]], in the season ten ''NCIS'' finale, \"[[Damned If You Do (NCIS)|Damned If You Do]]\".<ref name=tl>{{cite web|last=Roots|first=Kimberly|title=NCIS Exclusive: A JAG Favorite to Return in This Season's 'Nail-Biter' of a Finale|url=http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 12, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043344/http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Jackson has recurred as A.J. Chegwidden since the eighth season of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. Chegwidden is a Vietnam-era compatriot of series regulars Hetty Lange ([[Linda Hunt]]) and Owen Granger ([[Miguel Ferrer]]). David James Elliot and Catherine Bell returned to their roles as Harmon Rabb and Sarah MacKenzie for the first time since ''JAG'' ended in the last two episodes of [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|the tenth season of ''NCIS: Los Angeles'']].<ref>\"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep23|The Guardian]]\" and \"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep24|False Flag]]\".</ref>\n\nWhile several other actors who played major roles on ''JAG'' have also appeared on ''NCIS'', such as Scott Lawrence (Sturgis Turner on ''JAG''),<ref>Scott Lawrence played Captain Thomas Lind in the ''NCIS'' episode \"[[A Man Walks Into a Bar...]]\".</ref> Steven Culp (Clayton Webb on ''JAG''),<ref>Steven Culp played Commander William Skinner in the ''NCIS'' fifth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 5)#ep100|Chimera]]\".</ref> Randy Vazquez (Victor Galindez on ''JAG''),<ref>Randy Vazquez played ATF Special Agent Phillip Caffey in the ''NCIS'' twelfth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 12)#ep278|No Good Deed]]\".</ref> and [[Michael Bellisario]] ([[Mikey Roberts]] on ''JAG'');<ref>Recurring part as [[List of NCIS characters#Charles .22Chip.22 Sterling|Chip Sterling]] in four episodes (\"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep52|The Voyeur's Web]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep53|Honor Code]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep54|Under Covers]]\", and \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep55|Frame Up]]\") of the third season of ''NCIS''.</ref> they played completely different characters when appearing on ''NCIS''. Similarly, after [[Sean Murray (actor)|Sean Murray]] (Donald Bellisario's stepson) played a one-off Ensign character in ''JAG'' season 4, and the recurring character of Danny Walden in season 6, he joined the core cast of ''NCIS'' during the first season as Tim McGee, and is still on the show as of 2019.\n\nFirst introduced in the NCIS back-door pilot, [[Alicia Coppola]] appeared as Navy judge advocate Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman in several episodes of ''NCIS''.<ref>''NCIS'' episodes: \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep18|UnSEALeD]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 2)#7|Call of Silence]]\" and \"[[NCIS (season 2)#ep44|Hometown Hero]]\".</ref> [[Adam Baldwin]] played the same guest role, Navy SEAL Commander Michael Rainer, in one episode of each show.<ref>''JAG'': \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep195|Good Intentions]]\"'' NCIS'': \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep22|A Weak Link]]\" (first season).</ref>\n\n===''First Monday'' cross-over===\n''[[First Monday]]'' was a short-lived series co-created by Bellisario and [[Paul Levine]] about fictional [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices and their clerks, which aired in 2002 and starred [[James Garner]] and [[Joe Mantegna]]. The character of [[U.S. Senator]] Edward Sheffield ([[Dean Stockwell]]), who appeared in three episodes of that show, later became a recurring character on ''JAG'' as the new [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], starting in season eight.\n\n===''Yes, Dear'' tribute===\nThe sitcom ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' did an episode called \"Let's Get Jaggy With It\" where Greg's father Tom ([[Tim Conway]]) wins a walk-on role on ''JAG''. Catherine Bell guest-starred as herself while David James Elliott, Patrick Labyorteaux, and Scott Lawrence guest-starred as their respective ''JAG'' characters.\n\n==Home media==\nOn September 1, 1998, the pilot episode of ''JAG'' was released on [[VHS]] cassette in the U.S. by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]]. However, no further episodes of the series proper were released on any home entertainment media while the show was still in production, allegedly due to syndication deals made with several broadcasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |title=JAG faq |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305193454/http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}, Retrieved on 2013-09-17.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2006, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount]]) has released all 10 seasons on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/JAG/2445#News JAG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217115007/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/JAG/2445 |date=February 17, 2013 }}, [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]. retrieved on 2013-09-17.</ref> Seasons 1 to 4 are released with a 4:3 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], while seasons 5 to 10 have a 16:9 aspect ratio.
