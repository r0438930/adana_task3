The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]'', and most recently in a [[BBC]] podcast ''13 Minutes to the Moon'' (2020).<ref>[www.bbcworldservice.com/13 minutes BBC World Service, 13 Minustes to the Moon] access April 13, 2020</ref>\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces.

One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]'', and most recently in a [[BBC]] podcast ''13 Minutes to the Moon'' (2020).<ref>[www.bbcworldservice.com/13 minutes BBC World Service, 13 Minustes to the Moon] access 13 April 2020</ref>\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

Each member of the prime crew spent over 400 hours in simulators of the CM and (for Lovell and Haise) of the LM at KSC and at Houston, some of which involved the flight controllers at Mission Control.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}} Flight controllers participated in many simulations of problems with the spacecraft in flight, which taught them how to react in an emergency.<ref name = \"Cass 1\" />  Specialized simulators at other locations were also used by the crew members.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}}\n\nThe astronauts of Apollo 11 had minimal time for geology training, with only six months between crew assignment and launch; higher priorities took much of their time.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=100}} Apollo 12 saw more such training, including practice in the field, using a CAPCOM and a simulated backroom of scientists, to whom the astronauts had to describe what they saw.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=103\u2013104}} Scientist-astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] saw that there was limited enthusiasm for geology field trips. Believing an inspirational teacher was needed, Schmitt arranged for Lovell and Haise to meet his old professor, [[Caltech]]'s [[Leon Silver|Lee Silver]]. The two astronauts, and backups Young and Duke, went on a field trip with Silver at their own time and expense. At the end of their week together, Lovell made Silver their geology mentor, who would be extensively involved in the geology planning for Apollo&nbsp;13.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=107\u2013111}} [[Farouk El-Baz]] oversaw the training of Mattingly and his backup, Swigert, which involved describing and photographing simulated lunar landmarks from airplanes.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=134}} El-Baz had all three prime crew astronauts describe geologic features they saw during their flights between Houston and KSC; Mattingly's enthusiasm caused other astronauts, such as Apollo 14's CMP, Roosa, to seek out El-Baz as a teacher.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nConcerned about how close Apollo 11's LM, ''Eagle'', had come to running out of propellant during its lunar descent, mission planners decided that beginning with Apollo&nbsp;13, the CSM would bring the LM to the low orbit from which the landing attempt would commence. This was a change from Apollo 11 and 12, on which the LM made the burn to bring it to the lower orbit. The change was part of an effort to increase the amount of hover time available to the astronauts as the missions headed into rougher terrain.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=53}}\n\nThe plan was to devote the first of the two four-hour lunar surface [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular activities]] (EVAs) to setting up the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) group of scientific instruments; during the second, Lovell and Haise would investigate Cone crater, near the planned landing site.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=363}} The two astronauts wore their spacesuits for some 20 walk-throughs of EVA procedures, including sample gathering and use of tools and other equipment. They flew in the \"[[Vomit Comet]]\" in simulated microgravity or lunar gravity, including practice in donning and doffing spacesuits. To prepare for the descent to the Moon's surface, Lovell flew the [[Lunar Landing Training Vehicle]] (LLTV).{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=105}} Despite the fact that four of the five LLTVs and similar Lunar Landing Research Vehicles crashed during the course of the Apollo program, mission commanders considered flying them invaluable experience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Eric M.|title=Lunar Landing Training Vehicle NASA 952|date=April 29, 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2019|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/LLTV-952.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal}}</ref>\n\n== Experiments and scientific objectives ==\n[[File:Lovell and Haise geology training (S70-20253).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lovell (left) and Haise during geology training in Hawaii, January 1970]]\n\nApollo&nbsp;13's designated landing site was near [[Fra Mauro (crater)|Fra Mauro crater]]; the [[Fra Mauro formation]] was believed to contain much material spattered by the impact that had filled the [[Imbrium basin]] early in the Moon's history.

Swigert initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the LM, but he and Lovell quickly realized there was no leak.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=293}} The Main Bus&nbsp;B undervolt meant that there was insufficient voltage flowing from the SM's three power cells (fueled by hydrogen and oxygen piped from their respective tanks) to the second of the SM's two electric power distribution systems. Almost everything in the CSM required power. Although the bus momentarily returned to normal status, soon both buses A and B were short on voltage.

A \"direct abort\" would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces.

One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

The resulting fire quickly increased pressure inside the tank and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (SM Sector{{nbsp}}4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated as nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

Nonetheless, the switches Beech used were not rated for 65 volts.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=374}}\n\nAt NAR's facility, Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 had been originally installed in an oxygen shelf placed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, SM-106, but which was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem and another shelf substituted. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970. During the test, the cryogenic tanks were filled, but Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 could not be emptied through the normal drain line, and a report was written documenting the problem. After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied. Temperatures on the heater tube within the tank may have reached {{convert|1,000|F|C|order=flip|-1}}, most likely damaging the Teflon insulation.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-23}} The temperature gauge was not designed to read higher than {{convert|85|F|C|order=flip}}, so the technician monitoring the procedure detected nothing unusual.

This required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} The third tank was placed in Bay{{nbsp}}1 of the SM, on the side opposite the other two, and was given an isolation valve that could isolate it from the fuel cells and from the other two oxygen tanks in an emergency, and allow it to feed the CM's environmental system only.
