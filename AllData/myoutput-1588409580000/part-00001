It marked the culmination of the [[1988 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the fourth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. Both Australia and England had previously won the competition; England won [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|the inaugural tournament in 1973]], while Australia won in both [[1978 Women's Cricket World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup|1982]]. Australia won the match [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|by eight wickets]] to claim their third world title.\n\nAustralia and England finished first and second in the league-stage to claim their places in the final. England [[Batting (cricket)|batted]] first in the final, but were hindered by a slow [[outfield]], and found scoring difficult. The humid conditions helped Australia's [[Spin bowling|spin bowlers]], [[Lyn Fullston]] and [[Lyn Larsen]], who combined for five wickets. [[Jan Brittin]] top-scored for England with 46 runs, as they made 127 for seven. In response, Australia initially struggled, losing two early wickets for 14 runs. An unbroken [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 115 runs between [[Lindsay Reeler]] and [[Denise Annetts]] saw Australia to victory with more than 15 [[Over (cricket)|overs]] remaining. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[1988 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the fourth [[Women's Cricket World Cup]]. The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref name=\"icc-hist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/womens-world-cup/history |title=ICC Women's World Cup History |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> The 1988 tournament featured five teams; [[Australia women's national cricket team|Australia]], [[England women's cricket team|England]], [[Ireland women's cricket team|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands women's national cricket team|Netherlands]] and [[New Zealand women's national cricket team|New Zealand]]. It took place between 29 November and 18 December, featuring 22 matches over 20 days.<ref name=\"wisden\"/> England had won the first World Cup on home soil, before Australia claimed both the next two. Neither of the first two tournaments had featured a final, but had rather been league competitions, in which the team which finished with the most points won.

It marked the culmination of the [[1988 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the fourth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. Both Australia and England had previously won the competition; England won [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|the inaugural tournament in 1973]], while Australia won in both [[1978 Women's Cricket World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup|1982]]. Australia won the match [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|by eight wickets]] to claim their third world title.\n\nAustralia and England finished first and second in the league-stage to claim their places in the final. England [[Batting (cricket)|batted]] first in the final, but were hindered by a slow [[outfield]], and found scoring difficult. The humid conditions helped Australia's [[Spin bowling|spin bowlers]], [[Lyn Fullston]] and [[Lyn Larsen]], who combined for five wickets. [[Jan Brittin]] top-scored for England with 46 runs, as they made 127 for seven. In response, Australia initially struggled, losing two early wickets for 14 runs. An unbroken [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 115 runs between [[Lindsay Reeler]] and [[Denise Annetts]] saw Australia to victory with more than 15 [[Over (cricket)|overs]] remaining. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[1988 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the fourth [[Women's Cricket World Cup]]. The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref name=\"icc-hist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/womens-world-cup/history |title=ICC Women's World Cup History |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> The 1988 tournament featured five teams; [[Australia women's national cricket team|Australia]], [[England women's cricket team|England]], [[Ireland women's cricket team|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands women's national cricket team|Netherlands]] and [[New Zealand women's national cricket team|New Zealand]]. It took place between 29 November and 18 December, featuring 22 matches over 20 days.<ref name=\"wisden\"/> England had won the first World Cup on home soil, before Australia claimed both the next two. Neither of the first two tournaments had featured a final, but had rather been league competitions, in which the team which finished with the most points won. Australia had defeated England by three [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]] in [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup Final|the final]] of the [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup|1982 World Cup]].<ref name=\"icc-hist\"/>\n\n==Route to the final==\n{{main|1988 Women's Cricket World Cup}}\nEach team played eight matches during the round-robin stage of the tournament, facing each other twice.
