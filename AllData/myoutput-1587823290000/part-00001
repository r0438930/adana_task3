The word is sometimes rendered with the nasalised vowels as ''G\u00e3'' or ''G\u00e3g\u00e3''. Historian [[Carl Christian Reindorf]] confirmed this etymology, proposing a link between the martial qualities and migratory behaviour of the local ants and those of the Ga people. The link between the [[ethnonym]] and ants was explicitly reflected in the recognition of anthills as sacred places. Often ringed by sacred fences (''aklabatsa''), the tall red mounds dotting Accra's hinterland were seen as microcosms of human community and as nodal points between the known world and the world of the dead.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile the Ga used the reference to the invasive species of dark-brown swarming ants to connote military prowess and their ancient conquest of [[Guang languages|Guang]] speakers residing in the Accra Plains, the Akan-speaking appropriation and translation of this metaphor had a less than generous meaning. Instead of viewing Ga speakers as a formidable military force, the Akan-speaking term \"''Nkran''\" cast Ga peoples as pests or nuisances to be controlled or exterminated.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ZB2CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=accra+nkran#v=onepage&q=accra%20nkran&f=false |title=Gold Coast Diasporas: Identity, Culture, and Power |last=Rucker |first=Walter C. |date=28 September 2015 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-01701-7 |location= |pages=30 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Ga'' is actually a cognate of the name ''Akan'', one of a few words in which {{IPA|[g]}} corresponds to {{IPA|[k]}} in Akan.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erLnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA113&dq=accra+akra#v=onepage&q=accra%20akra&f=false |title=Korle Meets the Sea: A Sociolinguistic History of Accra |last=Dakubu |first=Mary Esther Kropp |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-506061-4 |location= |pages=113 |language=en}}</ref> ''Ga'' also gave its name to the [[Greater Accra Region#Districts|Ga districts]] surrounding Accra.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PEQgnFtkxmMC&pg=PA4&dq=accra+nkran#v=onepage&q=accra%20nkran&f=false |title=The City of Accra \u2013 A Pictorial Visit |last=Ntiamoah |first=Eric Maclean |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=978-1-4343-5860-8 |location= |pages=4 |language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe spelling ''Accra'' was given to ''Nkran'' by [[Europeans]].<ref name=\":1\" /> An earlier spelling used by the [[Danish colonial empire|Danes]] was ''Akra.''<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVJuQbQ0UgwC&pg=PA89&dq=accra+akra#v=onepage&q=accra%20akra&f=false |title=The Spiritual in the Secular: Missionaries and Knowledge about Africa |last=Harries |first=Patrick |last2=Maxwell |first2=David |date=20 July 2012 |publisher=Wm.

Nkran was later corrupted by the [[Danes]] to Akra, then to present-day Accra. ''Nkran'' in the [[Ga language]] is ''Gaga'', thus they also started calling themselves Ga. Due to their sheer numbers, the indigenous Lartehs thus relocated to the [[Akuapem Mountains|Akuapem]] ridge. The Ga are also part of the main Guan group that started the initial migration from the [[Nubian people|Nubia Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akuapem.com/gpage4.html |title=The Larteh Story |accessdate=6 July 2015 |publisher=Akuapem Organisation |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010134/http://akuapem.com/gpage4.html |archivedate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Accra was not the most prominent trading centre; the trade hubs of the time were the ports at [[Ada, Ghana|Ada]] and [[Prampram]], along with the inland centres of [[Dodowa]] and [[Akuse]]. The Dutch built the nearby outposts of [[Ussher Fort]] while the British and the Swedes built James Fort and Christiansborg castles, respectively. By the 17th century, Portugal, France and Denmark, had constructed forts in the city.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nBritain gradually acquired the interests of all other countries beginning in 1851, when Denmark sold [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (which they had acquired from the Swedes) and their other forts to the British. The Netherlands was the last to sell out, in 1871. In 1873, after decades of tension between the British and [[Ashanti people|Ashantis]], the British attacked and virtually destroyed [[Kumasi]]. The British then captured Accra in 1874, and in 1877, at the end of the second [[Anglo-Asante Wars|Anglo-Asante War]], Accra replaced [[Cape Coast]] as the capital of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]. This decision was made because Accra had a drier climate relative to Cape Coast. Until this time, the settlement of Accra was confined between Ussher Fort to the east and the [[Korle Lagoon]] to the west.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |title=History of Accra |accessdate=22 July 2010 |publisher=The African Executive |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707101722/http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs the newly established Gold Coast's administrative functions were moved to Accra (1877), an influx of British colonial administrator and settlers grew around the Christiansborg (modern Osu, Ministries, Ridge, Labone, and Cantonments) began, and the city began to expand to accommodate the new residents. Victoriaborg was formed in the late 19th century as an exclusively European residential neighbourhood, located to the east of the city limits of the time. The boundaries of Accra were further stretched in 1908. This expansion entailed the creation of a native-only neighbourhood, intended to accommodate members of the native population as a means of relieving congestion problems in the overcrowded city centre. [[Adabraka]] was thus established to the north of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog261/eskidmore/history.htm |title=History of Accra |accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hauptstra\u00dfeAccra18851908 300dpi.jpg|thumb|right|A main street of central Accra sometime between 1885 and 1908]]\n\nOne of the most influential decisions in the history of the city was that of building the Accra-Kumasi railway in 1908. This was to connect Accra, the country's foremost port at that time, with Ghana's main [[cocoa bean|cocoa]]-producing regions. In 1923, the railway was completed, and by 1924, cocoa was Ghana's largest export.\n\nThe British Gold Coast heavily influenced the shape that Accra took during this period. For example, [[racial segregation]] of neighbourhoods was mandated by law until 1923, and all new buildings were required to be built out of stone or concrete. Despite these regulations, British settlers of the Gold Coast were very hesitant to invest any large amount of money into the city to maintain its infrastructure or improve public works. This did not change until the governorship of [[Gordon Guggisberg|Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]] during which period the three separate settlements (Osu, La and Jamestown) merged to become modern Accra. Guggisberg's administration laid out the present grid networked neighborhoods of Tudu, Adabraka and Asylum Down.\n\nAmong the achievements of Guggisberg was the building of a bridge across the Korle Lagoon in 1923, which opened the land west of the lagoon for settlement. Guggisberg also oversaw the building of a major hospital (Korle-Bu) and secondary school (Achimota). Such improvements led to an increase in Accra's population due to the [[rural-urban migration|migration of rural dwellers]] into the city, and the immigration of increasing numbers of British businessmen and administrators.\n\n=== After World War II ===\n[[File:Jamestown lighthouse.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>[[Jamestown Lighthouse]] in [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Jamestown/Usshertown]]</center>]]\nIn the years following [[World War II]], the neighbourhoods of Ridge and Cantonments were planned as low-density developments for Europeans, while many rural migrants settled in neighbourhoods which had not yet been incorporated into Accra's municipal boundary, such as Nima and surrounding areas. Thus, the development of these neighbourhoods was unregulated by the government, creating a crowded and jumbled [[shanty-town]] landscape.\n\nAnother area of Accra that took shape at this time was the central business district (CBD). More administrative buildings were built on High Street, forming a massive judicial/administrative complex. Additionally, the expansion of the economy led to many more commercial buildings being built in the CBD.\n\nIn 1944, Accra's city planner Maxwell Fry devised a town plan, which was revised in 1958 by B.D.W. Treavallion and Alan Flood. Although the Fry/Trevallion plan was never followed through, it illustrated the British vision of how Accra should develop.\n\n==== Fry/Treavallion plan ====\nIn the Fry/Treavallion plan, a reorganisation of the CBD was called for, as well as the development of the coastal region of the city. To reorganise the CBD, the planners decided to superimpose a tight street grid north of Fort Ussher.\n\nTo the east of this newly organised CBD, the planners hoped to preserve a broad, open space for a restaurant, country club, and [[polo]] and [[cricket]] fields. Additionally, the British planners intended to build large numbers of public squares, fountains, and ornamental pools and statues throughout the city, as well as a vast Parliament Complex in the city centre. Lastly, the Fry/Treavallion plan included plans to make the coastal region an extension of the exclusive European neighbourhood of Victoriaborg, and to create a recreational preserve for the elite. However, the British Gold Coast ended before the Fry/Treavallion plan was enacted.\n\n==== Nkrumah Plan ====\nWhen [[Kwame Nkrumah]] became Ghana's first postindependence [[Prime Minister of Ghana|Prime Minister]] in 1957, he created his own plan for Accra's development.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 5</ref> Instead of creating spaces to serve the elite, Nkrumah sought to create spaces to inspire pride and nationalism in his people and people throughout Africa.\n\nRather than creating ornamental fountains and a large Parliament complex, Nkrumah decided to build landmarks such as Independence Square, the State House, and the Organisation of African Unity building, and to refurbish Christianborg Castle. Nkrumah decided to leave the Atlantic coastal region undeveloped, so as to not detract attention from the Community Centre or Independence Square, lending both spaces symbolic significance. The Nkrumah plan did not emphasise order nearly as much as the Fry/Treavallion plan did; whereas the British plan strove to lessen crowding in the commercial district and help relieve the overcrowding of neighbourhoods bordering the CBD, the Nkrumah plan allowed for continued compression of commercial establishments into the CBD, as well as increased migration into Jamestown.\n\nThe modern city is centred on the original British, Danish, and Dutch forts and their surrounding communities: [[Jamestown, Ghana|Jamestown]] near the British [[James Fort]], [[Osu, Accra|Osu]] near the Danish fort of [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (now [[Osu Castle]]), and [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Ussherstown]] near the Dutch [[Ussher fort]].\n\nTourist attractions include the National Museum of Ghana, the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Archives of Ghana and Ghana's central library, the National Theatre, the Accra Centre for National Culture, and the [[Jamestown Lighthouse]].\n[[File:Black Star Square and Independence Arch, Accra, Ghana.jpg|thumb|Black star Square]]\n\nThe [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]], [[Supreme Court of Ghana]], [[Black Star Square]] and the [[Bank of Ghana]] are also located in Accra.\n\nThe city is also a transportation hub, home to the [[Kotoka International Airport]], and railway links to [[Tema]], [[Sekondi-Takoradi]] and [[Kumasi]].

The average annual rainfall is about 730&nbsp;mm, which falls primarily during Ghana's two rainy seasons.

Inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement, as well as perceived corruption in government processes, lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government co-ordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of Accra's drainage infrastructure, according to the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]].<ref>[http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/  Future Climate for Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415220758/http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/ |date=15 April 2015 }}.

Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the midafternoon to 95% at night. The predominant wind direction in Accra is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16&nbsp;km/h. High wind gusts occur with [[thunderstorm]]s, which generally pass in [[squalls]] along the coast.\n\nThe maximum wind speed record in Accra is 107.4&nbsp;km/h (58 knots). Strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material. Several areas of Accra experience microclimatic effects. Low-profile [[drainage basin]]s with a north\u2013south orientation are not as well ventilated as those oriented east\u2013west.\n\nAir is often trapped in pockets over the city, and an insulation effect can give rise to a local increase in air temperature of several degrees. This occurs most notably in the Accra Newtown sports complex areas.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Accra ([[Accra International Airport]]) 1961\u20131990, extremes 1936\u20131997\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| Jan record high C = 35.8\n| Feb record high C = 37.1\n| Mar record high C = 36.2\n| Apr record high C = 35.0\n| May record high C = 34.6\n| Jun record high C = 31.5\n| Jul record high C = 32.3\n| Aug record high C = 32.8\n| Sep record high C = 33.9\n| Oct record high C = 33.6\n| Nov record high C = 38.0\n| Dec record high C = 36.0\n| year record high C = 38.0\n| Jan high C = 32.1\n| Feb high C = 32.7\n| Mar high C = 32.5\n| Apr high C = 32.2\n| May high C = 31.2\n| Jun high C = 29.3\n| Jul high C = 28.5\n| Aug high C = 28.0\n| Sep high C = 29.0\n| Oct high C = 30.5\n| Nov high C = 31.6\n| Dec high C = 31.7\n| year high C = 30.8\n| Jan mean C = 27.3\n| Feb mean C = 27.7\n| Mar mean C = 27.7\n| Apr mean C = 27.7\n| May mean C = 27.2\n| Jun mean C = 25.6\n| Jul mean C = 24.4\n| Aug mean C = 24.3\n| Sep mean C = 25.2\n| Oct mean C = 26.0\n| Nov mean C = 27.0\n| Dec mean C = 27.2\n| year mean C = 26.4\n| Jan low C = 23.4\n| Feb low C = 24.1\n| Mar low C = 24.1\n| Apr low C = 24.2\n| May low C = 23.9\n| Jun low C = 23.1\n| Jul low C = 22.5\n| Aug low C = 22.2\n| Sep low C = 22.4\n| Oct low C = 23.9\n| Nov low C = 23.5\n| Dec low C = 23.4\n| year low C = 23.4\n| Jan record low C = 15.0\n| Feb record low C = 16.7\n| Mar record low C = 18.9\n| Apr record low C = 19.4\n| May record low C = 18.6\n| Jun record low C = 17.8\n| Jul record low C = 17.8\n| Aug record low C = 17.2\n| Sep record low C = 18.3\n| Oct record low C = 19.4\n| Nov record low C = 17.8\n| Dec record low C = 16.7\n| year record low C = 15.0\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 10.9\n| Feb precipitation mm = 21.8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 57.1\n| Apr precipitation mm = 96.8\n| May precipitation mm = 131.2\n| Jun precipitation mm = 221.0\n| Jul precipitation mm = 66.0\n| Aug precipitation mm = 28.0\n| Sep precipitation mm = 67.8\n| Oct precipitation mm = 62.4\n| Nov precipitation mm = 27.7\n| Dec precipitation mm = 16.1\n| year precipitation mm = 806.8\n| Jan precipitation days = 1\n| Feb precipitation days = 2\n| Mar precipitation days = 5\n| Apr precipitation days = 6\n| May precipitation days = 10\n| Jun precipitation days = 15\n| Jul precipitation days = 9\n| Aug precipitation days = 7\n| Sep precipitation days = 8\n| Oct precipitation days = 7\n| Nov precipitation days = 3\n| Dec precipitation days = 2\n| year precipitation days = \n| Jan humidity = 77\n| Feb humidity = 78\n| Mar humidity = 79\n| Apr humidity = 80\n| May humidity = 81\n| Jun humidity = 85\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 83\n| Sep humidity = 81\n| Oct humidity = 82\n| Nov humidity = 80\n| Dec humidity = 80\n| year humidity = 81\n| Jan sun = 210.8\n| Feb sun = 206.2\n| Mar sun = 213.9\n| Apr sun = 219.0\n| May sun = 210.8\n| Jun sun = 141.0\n| Jul sun = 145.7\n| Aug sun = 155.0\n| Sep sun = 171.0\n| Oct sun = 226.3\n| Nov sun = 237.0\n| Dec sun = 241.8\n| year sun = \n| Jand sun = 6.8\n| Febd sun = 7.3\n| Mard sun = 6.9\n| Aprd sun = 7.3\n| Mayd sun = 6.8\n| Jund sun = 4.7\n| Juld sun = 4.7\n| Augd sun = 5.0\n| Sepd sun = 5.7\n| Octd sun = 7.3\n| Novd sun = 7.9\n| Decd sun = 7.8\n| yeard sun = 6.5\n| source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]] (average high, low and precipitation)<ref name=WMO>{{cite web |url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=921 |title=World Weather Information Service \u2013 Accra |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=17 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215614/http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=921 |archivedate=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n| source 2 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (extremes, humidity 1952\u20131967, mean temperature 1941\u20131994, and sun)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_654720_kt.pdf |title=Klimatafel von Accra (Int.

The area contains the \"37\" Military Hospital, [[The Flagstaff House]], several foreign [[embassy|embassies]], [[Achimota School]], Achimota Golf Park, and the [[University of Ghana]]'s Legon campus, which serves as Accra's northern boundary.\n\nGeographically, the areas north of Ring Road West and Central, east of Winneba/Graphic Road, west of Liberation Road, and the districts just north and south of the Kwame Nkrumah motorway are regarded as Northern Accra. Some areas North of Accra include, Ashongnman, Madina, Haatso, North and West Legon and others\n\n=== Accra East ===\nEastern Accra is largely residential and geographically north of Ring Road East, stretching as far north as Kwame Nkrumah Motorway; the district is bordered to the west by Liberation Road.\n\n=== Accra West ===\nWestern Accra is largely a residential and business area. Whilst geographically less expansive than the northern and eastern reaches of the city as a result of the large saltponds of Tettegu and Aplaku, it nonetheless boasts one of Accra's most important landmarks, the [[Korle Bu Teaching Hospital]].\n\nGeographically, the areas west of Ring Road West, extending as far west as the saltponds and south of Graphic Road, are considered Accra West.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&rlv=climate |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091832/http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&rlv=climate |archivedate=11 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe period between 1960 and 1970 saw rapid industrialisation and expansion in Accra's manufacturing and commercial sectors. This contributed to high [[rural-urban migration]] to the city, and consequently a high population growth rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091853/http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |archivedate=11 July 2011}}</ref> The stagnation of the Ghanaian economy during the 1970s slowed the growth of Accra's population, as shown by the falling growth rate of the 1970\u20131984 intercensal years. Later, however, the decline in agriculture in rural communities in Ghana and rising industrialisation in urban regions, coupled with the late-1980s boom in the [[service sector]], once again propelled immigration to Accra. The primacy of the Accra Metropolitan Area as the Greater Accra region's administrative, educational, industrial and commercial centre continues to be the major force for its population growth, with immigration contributing to over 35% of the Accra's population growth.\n\n=== Distribution and density ===\nThe gross density of population for the Accra Metropolitan Area in 2000 was 10.03 persons per hectare, compared to 6.23 per hectare in 1970. The highest densities were recorded in the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, with an overall average of 69.3 persons per hectare. At the community level, densities exceeding 250 persons per hectare occurred mostly in the immigrant and depressed areas in the oldest parts of Accra, such as Accra New Town, Nima, Jamestown and Usshertown. In higher-income areas, densities ranged between 17.5 and 40 persons per hectare.\n\n=== Population distribution by age and gender ===\nAccra's population is a very youthful one, with 56% of the population being under 24 years of age. This predominance of young people is not expected to decline in the foreseeable future. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the population are females, and the remaining 49% males. This gives a males-to-females ratio of 1:1.04. The greater number of females is a reflection of the nationwide trend, where the estimated ratio of males to females is 1:1.03.\n\n=== Migration ===\nDecentralisation is expected to reduce the migration rates in Accra. An assessment of the extent of migration to Accra, based on present locality and gender, reveals that 45% of residents in Accra are African immigrants from countries across the African continent.\n\n=== Housing ===\nParts of Central Accra comprise a mixture of very low-density development with under-used service infrastructure on the one hand, high-density development and overstretched infrastructure services on the other. The growth of Accra has led to the neglect of some of the old settlements, whilst efforts are being made to provide the newly developing suburban areas with services and infrastructure to cater for the needs of the middle-income earners. Peripheral residential development in Accra barely has sufficient infrastructure to support it. There are also large numbers of uncompleted houses, interspersed with pockets of undeveloped land, which are often subject of litigation, due to the inability of organisations and individuals who own them to complete or develop them due to lack of funds. Housing can be grouped into three broad categories: the low-income, middle-income and high-income areas. The low-income housing areas comprise Osu, Jamestown, Adedenkpo, Chorkor, La, Teshie, Nungua, Sukura, Kwashieman, Odorkor, Bubiashie, Abeka, Nima, Maamobi and Chorkor. Altogether, these areas accommodate about 58% of Accra's total population. Most of Accra's informal businesses are located in low-income areas.\nAlmost all low-income areas are built up with little room for expansion. This is particularly so in the areas of the inner city. The middle-income areas of Accra are predominantly populated by Ghanaian citizens and business, administrative and professional families. Much of the housing in these areas has been provided by state, parastatal and private sector organisations and individuals. The middle-income areas include Dansoman Estates, North Kaneshie Estates, Asylum Down, Kanda Estates, Abelempke, Achimota, Adenta and Tesano. Usually, these areas, unlike the low-income areas, are planned developments, but are in need of infrastructure services. Building materials and general housing conditions are of better quality. The middle-income group comprises 32% of the city's population of which are Ghanaian citizens make up. The high-income areas provide housing for the remaining 10% of the population of which Ghanaian citizens also make up. They include areas like North Ridge and West Ridge, Ringway Estates, north Labone Estates, Airport Residential Area, Roman Ridge, East Legon.\nThese areas are all planned and have well developed infrastructure with spacious and landscaped ground in sharp contrast with, particularly, the low-income areas. Buildings are usually built with [[sandcrete]] blocks, and have walls and roofed with aluminium, or [[asbestos]] roofing sheets. There are also high-income peripheral areas like Haatso, Kwabenya, Pokuase, Adenta, Taifa, Mallam, where development of engineering infrastructure is not yet complete. These areas developed ahead of infrastructure, however the Achimota-Ofankor [[controlled-access highway]] was scheduled to open in May 2012,{{Update inline|date=December 2014}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/383369/achimota-ofankor-road-to-open-to-traffic-in-may.html |title=Achimota-Ofankor Road To Open To Traffic in May |work=graphic.com.gh |publisher=[[Daily Graphic (Ghana)|Daily Graphic]] |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2016 |via=Modern Ghana |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512234613/https://www.modernghana.com/news/383369/achimota-ofankor-road-to-open-to-traffic-in-may.html |archivedate=12 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}and the Awoshie-Pokuase</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/Ghana-Awoshie-Pokuase%20Road%20ESIA%20Summary%20board%20board%2020%201%2009.pdf |title=Ghana: Awoshie-Pokuase Road Projet |publisher=afdb.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723071937/http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/Ghana-Awoshie-Pokuase%20Road%20ESIA%20Summary%20board%20board%2020%201%2009.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2013}}</ref> [[dual carriageway]] [[road construction]] was also due to be completed in 2012.{{Update inline|date=December 2014}} In total, 84.4% of all houses in the Accra Metropolitan Area have their outside walls made up of cement.

The word is sometimes rendered with the nasalised vowels as ''G\u00e3'' or ''G\u00e3g\u00e3''. Historian [[Carl Christian Reindorf]] confirmed this etymology, proposing a link between the martial qualities and migratory behaviour of the local ants and those of the Ga people. The link between the [[ethnonym]] and ants was explicitly reflected in the recognition of anthills as sacred places. Often ringed by sacred fences (''aklabatsa''), the tall red mounds dotting Accra's hinterland were seen as microcosms of human community and as nodal points between the known world and the world of the dead.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile the Ga used the reference to the invasive species of dark-brown swarming ants to connote military prowess and their ancient conquest of [[Guang languages|Guang]] speakers residing in the Accra Plains, the Akan-speaking appropriation and translation of this metaphor had a less than generous meaning. Instead of viewing Ga speakers as a formidable military force, the Akan-speaking term \"''Nkran''\" cast Ga peoples as pests or nuisances to be controlled or exterminated.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ZB2CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=accra+nkran#v=onepage&q=accra%20nkran&f=false |title=Gold Coast Diasporas: Identity, Culture, and Power |last=Rucker |first=Walter C. |date=28 September 2015 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-01701-7 |location= |pages=30 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Ga'' is actually a cognate of the name ''Akan'', one of a few words in which {{IPA|[g]}} corresponds to {{IPA|[k]}} in Akan.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erLnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA113&dq=accra+akra#v=onepage&q=accra%20akra&f=false |title=Korle Meets the Sea: A Sociolinguistic History of Accra |last=Dakubu |first=Mary Esther Kropp |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-506061-4 |location= |pages=113 |language=en}}</ref> ''Ga'' also gave its name to the [[Greater Accra Region#Districts|Ga districts]] surrounding Accra.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PEQgnFtkxmMC&pg=PA4&dq=accra+nkran#v=onepage&q=accra%20nkran&f=false |title=The City of Accra \u2013 A Pictorial Visit |last=Ntiamoah |first=Eric Maclean |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=978-1-4343-5860-8 |location= |pages=4 |language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe spelling ''Accra'' was given to ''Nkran'' by [[Europeans]].<ref name=\":1\" /> An earlier spelling used by the [[Danish colonial empire|Danes]] was ''Akra.''<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVJuQbQ0UgwC&pg=PA89&dq=accra+akra#v=onepage&q=accra%20akra&f=false |title=The Spiritual in the Secular: Missionaries and Knowledge about Africa |last=Harries |first=Patrick |last2=Maxwell |first2=David |date=20 July 2012 |publisher=Wm.

When the Guan ([[Larteh]]s) on the coast saw them on their canoes at sea, they looked like ants. Hence, the Lartehs refer to them as Nkran (ants). Nkran was later corrupted by the [[Danes]] to Akra, then to present-day Accra. ''Nkran'' in the [[Ga language]] is ''Gaga'', thus they also started calling themselves Ga. Due to their sheer numbers, the indigenous Lartehs thus relocated to the [[Akuapem Mountains|Akuapem]] ridge. The Ga are also part of the main Guan group that started the initial migration from the [[Nubian people|Nubia Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akuapem.com/gpage4.html |title=The Larteh Story |accessdate=6 July 2015 |publisher=Akuapem Organisation |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010134/http://akuapem.com/gpage4.html |archivedate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Accra was not the most prominent trading centre; the trade hubs of the time were the ports at [[Ada, Ghana|Ada]] and [[Prampram]], along with the inland centres of [[Dodowa]] and [[Akuse]]. The Dutch built the nearby outposts of [[Ussher Fort]] while the British and the Swedes built James Fort and Christiansborg castles, respectively. By the 17th century, Portugal, France and Denmark, had constructed forts in the city.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nBritain gradually acquired the interests of all other countries beginning in 1851, when Denmark sold [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (which they had acquired from the Swedes) and their other forts to the British. The Netherlands was the last to sell out, in 1871. In 1873, after decades of tension between the British and [[Ashanti people|Ashantis]], the British attacked and virtually destroyed [[Kumasi]]. The British then captured Accra in 1874, and in 1877, at the end of the second [[Anglo-Asante Wars|Anglo-Asante War]], Accra replaced [[Cape Coast]] as the capital of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]. This decision was made because Accra had a drier climate relative to Cape Coast. Until this time, the settlement of Accra was confined between Ussher Fort to the east and the [[Korle Lagoon]] to the west.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |title=History of Accra |accessdate=22 July 2010 |publisher=The African Executive |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707101722/http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs the newly established Gold Coast's administrative functions were moved to Accra (1877), an influx of British colonial administrator and settlers grew around the Christiansborg (modern Osu, Ministries, Ridge, Labone, and Cantonments) began, and the city began to expand to accommodate the new residents. Victoriaborg was formed in the late 19th century as an exclusively European residential neighbourhood, located to the east of the city limits of the time. The boundaries of Accra were further stretched in 1908. This expansion entailed the creation of a native-only neighbourhood, intended to accommodate members of the native population as a means of relieving congestion problems in the overcrowded city centre. [[Adabraka]] was thus established to the north of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog261/eskidmore/history.htm |title=History of Accra |accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hauptstra\u00dfeAccra18851908 300dpi.jpg|thumb|right|A main street of central Accra sometime between 1885 and 1908]]\n\nOne of the most influential decisions in the history of the city was that of building the Accra-Kumasi railway in 1908. This was to connect Accra, the country's foremost port at that time, with Ghana's main [[cocoa bean|cocoa]]-producing regions. In 1923, the railway was completed, and by 1924, cocoa was Ghana's largest export.\n\nThe British Gold Coast heavily influenced the shape that Accra took during this period. For example, [[racial segregation]] of neighbourhoods was mandated by law until 1923, and all new buildings were required to be built out of stone or concrete. Despite these regulations, British settlers of the Gold Coast were very hesitant to invest any large amount of money into the city to maintain its infrastructure or improve public works. This did not change until the governorship of [[Gordon Guggisberg|Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]] during which period the three separate settlements (Osu, La and Jamestown) merged to become modern Accra. Guggisberg's administration laid out the present grid networked neighborhoods of Tudu, Adabraka and Asylum Down.\n\nAmong the achievements of Guggisberg was the building of a bridge across the Korle Lagoon in 1923, which opened the land west of the lagoon for settlement. Guggisberg also oversaw the building of a major hospital (Korle-Bu) and secondary school (Achimota). Such improvements led to an increase in Accra's population due to the [[rural-urban migration|migration of rural dwellers]] into the city, and the immigration of increasing numbers of British businessmen and administrators.\n\n=== After World War II ===\n[[File:Jamestown lighthouse.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>[[Jamestown Lighthouse]] in [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Jamestown/Usshertown]]</center>]]\nIn the years following [[World War II]], the neighbourhoods of Ridge and Cantonments were planned as low-density developments for Europeans, while many rural migrants settled in neighbourhoods which had not yet been incorporated into Accra's municipal boundary, such as Nima and surrounding areas. Thus, the development of these neighbourhoods was unregulated by the government, creating a crowded and jumbled [[shanty-town]] landscape.\n\nAnother area of Accra that took shape at this time was the central business district (CBD). More administrative buildings were built on High Street, forming a massive judicial/administrative complex. Additionally, the expansion of the economy led to many more commercial buildings being built in the CBD.\n\nIn 1944, Accra's city planner Maxwell Fry devised a town plan, which was revised in 1958 by B.D.W. Treavallion and Alan Flood. Although the Fry/Trevallion plan was never followed through, it illustrated the British vision of how Accra should develop.\n\n==== Fry/Treavallion plan ====\nIn the Fry/Treavallion plan, a reorganisation of the CBD was called for, as well as the development of the coastal region of the city. To reorganise the CBD, the planners decided to superimpose a tight street grid north of Fort Ussher.\n\nTo the east of this newly organised CBD, the planners hoped to preserve a broad, open space for a restaurant, country club, and [[polo]] and [[cricket]] fields. Additionally, the British planners intended to build large numbers of public squares, fountains, and ornamental pools and statues throughout the city, as well as a vast Parliament Complex in the city centre. Lastly, the Fry/Treavallion plan included plans to make the coastal region an extension of the exclusive European neighbourhood of Victoriaborg, and to create a recreational preserve for the elite. However, the British Gold Coast ended before the Fry/Treavallion plan was enacted.\n\n==== Nkrumah Plan ====\nWhen [[Kwame Nkrumah]] became Ghana's first postindependence [[Prime Minister of Ghana|Prime Minister]] in 1957, he created his own plan for Accra's development.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 5</ref> Instead of creating spaces to serve the elite, Nkrumah sought to create spaces to inspire pride and nationalism in his people and people throughout Africa.\n\nRather than creating ornamental fountains and a large Parliament complex, Nkrumah decided to build landmarks such as Independence Square, the State House, and the Organisation of African Unity building, and to refurbish Christianborg Castle. Nkrumah decided to leave the Atlantic coastal region undeveloped, so as to not detract attention from the Community Centre or Independence Square, lending both spaces symbolic significance. The Nkrumah plan did not emphasise order nearly as much as the Fry/Treavallion plan did; whereas the British plan strove to lessen crowding in the commercial district and help relieve the overcrowding of neighbourhoods bordering the CBD, the Nkrumah plan allowed for continued compression of commercial establishments into the CBD, as well as increased migration into Jamestown.\n\nThe modern city is centred on the original British, Danish, and Dutch forts and their surrounding communities: [[Jamestown, Ghana|Jamestown]] near the British [[James Fort]], [[Osu, Accra|Osu]] near the Danish fort of [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (now [[Osu Castle]]), and [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Ussherstown]] near the Dutch [[Ussher fort]].\n\nTourist attractions include the National Museum of Ghana, the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Archives of Ghana and Ghana's central library, the National Theatre, the Accra Centre for National Culture, and the [[Jamestown Lighthouse]].\n[[File:Black Star Square and Independence Arch, Accra, Ghana.jpg|thumb|Black star Square]]\n\nThe [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]], [[Supreme Court of Ghana]], [[Black Star Square]] and the [[Bank of Ghana]] are also located in Accra.\n\nThe city is also a transportation hub, home to the [[Kotoka International Airport]], and railway links to [[Tema]], [[Sekondi-Takoradi]] and [[Kumasi]].

The average annual rainfall is about 730&nbsp;mm, which falls primarily during Ghana's two rainy seasons. The chief rainy season begins in April and ends in mid-July, whilst a weaker second rainy season occurs in October. Rain usually falls in short intensive storms and causes local flooding in which drainage channels are obstructed.\n\nVery little variation in temperature occurs throughout the year. The mean monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|25.9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in August (the coolest) to {{convert|29.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in March (the hottest), with an annual average of {{convert|27.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. The \"cooler\" months tend to be more [[humid]] than the warmer months. As a result, during the warmer months and particularly during the windy [[harmattan]] season, the city experiences a breezy \"dry heat\" that feels less warm than the \"cooler\" but more humid rainy season.\n\nAs a coastal city, Accra is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise, with population growth putting increasing pressure on the coastal areas.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf Using climate information to achieve long-term development objectives in coastal Ghana and Mozambique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318210759/http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf |date=18 March 2015 }}. [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]]. Retrieved 16 April 2015</ref> Drainage infrastructure is particularly at risk, which has profound implications for people's livelihoods, especially in informal settlements. Inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement, as well as perceived corruption in government processes, lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government co-ordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of Accra's drainage infrastructure, according to the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]].<ref>[http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/  Future Climate for Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415220758/http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/ |date=15 April 2015 }}.

Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the midafternoon to 95% at night. The predominant wind direction in Accra is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16&nbsp;km/h. High wind gusts occur with [[thunderstorm]]s, which generally pass in [[squalls]] along the coast.\n\nThe maximum wind speed record in Accra is 107.4&nbsp;km/h (58 knots). Strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material. Several areas of Accra experience microclimatic effects. Low-profile [[drainage basin]]s with a north\u2013south orientation are not as well ventilated as those oriented east\u2013west.\n\nAir is often trapped in pockets over the city, and an insulation effect can give rise to a local increase in air temperature of several degrees. This occurs most notably in the Accra Newtown sports complex areas.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Accra ([[Accra International Airport]]) 1961\u20131990, extremes 1936\u20131997\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| Jan record high C = 35.8\n| Feb record high C = 37.1\n| Mar record high C = 36.2\n| Apr record high C = 35.0\n| May record high C = 34.6\n| Jun record high C = 31.5\n| Jul record high C = 32.3\n| Aug record high C = 32.8\n| Sep record high C = 33.9\n| Oct record high C = 33.6\n| Nov record high C = 38.0\n| Dec record high C = 36.0\n| year record high C = 38.0\n| Jan high C = 32.1\n| Feb high C = 32.7\n| Mar high C = 32.5\n| Apr high C = 32.2\n| May high C = 31.2\n| Jun high C = 29.3\n| Jul high C = 28.5\n| Aug high C = 28.0\n| Sep high C = 29.0\n| Oct high C = 30.5\n| Nov high C = 31.6\n| Dec high C = 31.7\n| year high C = 30.8\n| Jan mean C = 27.3\n| Feb mean C = 27.7\n| Mar mean C = 27.7\n| Apr mean C = 27.7\n| May mean C = 27.2\n| Jun mean C = 25.6\n| Jul mean C = 24.4\n| Aug mean C = 24.3\n| Sep mean C = 25.2\n| Oct mean C = 26.0\n| Nov mean C = 27.0\n| Dec mean C = 27.2\n| year mean C = 26.4\n| Jan low C = 23.4\n| Feb low C = 24.1\n| Mar low C = 24.1\n| Apr low C = 24.2\n| May low C = 23.9\n| Jun low C = 23.1\n| Jul low C = 22.5\n| Aug low C = 22.2\n| Sep low C = 22.4\n| Oct low C = 23.9\n| Nov low C = 23.5\n| Dec low C = 23.4\n| year low C = 23.4\n| Jan record low C = 15.0\n| Feb record low C = 16.7\n| Mar record low C = 18.9\n| Apr record low C = 19.4\n| May record low C = 18.6\n| Jun record low C = 17.8\n| Jul record low C = 17.8\n| Aug record low C = 17.2\n| Sep record low C = 18.3\n| Oct record low C = 19.4\n| Nov record low C = 17.8\n| Dec record low C = 16.7\n| year record low C = 15.0\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 10.9\n| Feb precipitation mm = 21.8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 57.1\n| Apr precipitation mm = 96.8\n| May precipitation mm = 131.2\n| Jun precipitation mm = 221.0\n| Jul precipitation mm = 66.0\n| Aug precipitation mm = 28.0\n| Sep precipitation mm = 67.8\n| Oct precipitation mm = 62.4\n| Nov precipitation mm = 27.7\n| Dec precipitation mm = 16.1\n| year precipitation mm = 806.8\n| Jan precipitation days = 1\n| Feb precipitation days = 2\n| Mar precipitation days = 5\n| Apr precipitation days = 6\n| May precipitation days = 10\n| Jun precipitation days = 15\n| Jul precipitation days = 9\n| Aug precipitation days = 7\n| Sep precipitation days = 8\n| Oct precipitation days = 7\n| Nov precipitation days = 3\n| Dec precipitation days = 2\n| year precipitation days = \n| Jan humidity = 77\n| Feb humidity = 78\n| Mar humidity = 79\n| Apr humidity = 80\n| May humidity = 81\n| Jun humidity = 85\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 83\n| Sep humidity = 81\n| Oct humidity = 82\n| Nov humidity = 80\n| Dec humidity = 80\n| year humidity = 81\n| Jan sun = 210.8\n| Feb sun = 206.2\n| Mar sun = 213.9\n| Apr sun = 219.0\n| May sun = 210.8\n| Jun sun = 141.0\n| Jul sun = 145.7\n| Aug sun = 155.0\n| Sep sun = 171.0\n| Oct sun = 226.3\n| Nov sun = 237.0\n| Dec sun = 241.8\n| year sun = \n| Jand sun = 6.8\n| Febd sun = 7.3\n| Mard sun = 6.9\n| Aprd sun = 7.3\n| Mayd sun = 6.8\n| Jund sun = 4.7\n| Juld sun = 4.7\n| Augd sun = 5.0\n| Sepd sun = 5.7\n| Octd sun = 7.3\n| Novd sun = 7.9\n| Decd sun = 7.8\n| yeard sun = 6.5\n| source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]] (average high, low and precipitation)<ref name=WMO>{{cite web |url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=921 |title=World Weather Information Service \u2013 Accra |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=17 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215614/http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=921 |archivedate=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n| source 2 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (extremes, humidity 1952\u20131967, mean temperature 1941\u20131994, and sun)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_654720_kt.pdf |title=Klimatafel von Accra (Int.

The area contains the \"37\" Military Hospital, [[The Flagstaff House]], several foreign [[embassy|embassies]], [[Achimota School]], Achimota Golf Park, and the [[University of Ghana]]'s Legon campus, which serves as Accra's northern boundary.\n\nGeographically, the areas north of Ring Road West and Central, east of Winneba/Graphic Road, west of Liberation Road, and the districts just north and south of the Kwame Nkrumah motorway are regarded as Northern Accra. Some areas North of Accra include, Ashongnman, Madina, Haatso, North and West Legon and others\n\n=== Accra East ===\nEastern Accra is largely residential and geographically north of Ring Road East, stretching as far north as Kwame Nkrumah Motorway; the district is bordered to the west by Liberation Road.\n\n=== Accra West ===\nWestern Accra is largely a residential and business area. Whilst geographically less expansive than the northern and eastern reaches of the city as a result of the large saltponds of Tettegu and Aplaku, it nonetheless boasts one of Accra's most important landmarks, the [[Korle Bu Teaching Hospital]].\n\nGeographically, the areas west of Ring Road West, extending as far west as the saltponds and south of Graphic Road, are considered Accra West.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&rlv=climate |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091832/http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&rlv=climate |archivedate=11 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe period between 1960 and 1970 saw rapid industrialisation and expansion in Accra's manufacturing and commercial sectors. This contributed to high [[rural-urban migration]] to the city, and consequently a high population growth rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091853/http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |archivedate=11 July 2011}}</ref> The stagnation of the Ghanaian economy during the 1970s slowed the growth of Accra's population, as shown by the falling growth rate of the 1970\u20131984 intercensal years. Later, however, the decline in agriculture in rural communities in Ghana and rising industrialisation in urban regions, coupled with the late-1980s boom in the [[service sector]], once again propelled immigration to Accra. The primacy of the Accra Metropolitan Area as the Greater Accra region's administrative, educational, industrial and commercial centre continues to be the major force for its population growth, with immigration contributing to over 35% of the Accra's population growth.\n\n=== Distribution and density ===\nThe gross density of population for the Accra Metropolitan Area in 2000 was 10.03 persons per hectare, compared to 6.23 per hectare in 1970. The highest densities were recorded in the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, with an overall average of 69.3 persons per hectare. At the community level, densities exceeding 250 persons per hectare occurred mostly in the immigrant and depressed areas in the oldest parts of Accra, such as Accra New Town, Nima, Jamestown and Usshertown. In higher-income areas, densities ranged between 17.5 and 40 persons per hectare.\n\n=== Population distribution by age and gender ===\nAccra's population is a very youthful one, with 56% of the population being under 24 years of age. This predominance of young people is not expected to decline in the foreseeable future. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the population are females, and the remaining 49% males. This gives a males-to-females ratio of 1:1.04. The greater number of females is a reflection of the nationwide trend, where the estimated ratio of males to females is 1:1.03.\n\n=== Migration ===\nDecentralisation is expected to reduce the migration rates in Accra. An assessment of the extent of migration to Accra, based on present locality and gender, reveals that 45% of residents in Accra are African immigrants from countries across the African continent.\n\n=== Housing ===\nParts of Central Accra comprise a mixture of very low-density development with under-used service infrastructure on the one hand, high-density development and overstretched infrastructure services on the other. The growth of Accra has led to the neglect of some of the old settlements, whilst efforts are being made to provide the newly developing suburban areas with services and infrastructure to cater for the needs of the middle-income earners. Peripheral residential development in Accra barely has sufficient infrastructure to support it. There are also large numbers of uncompleted houses, interspersed with pockets of undeveloped land, which are often subject of litigation, due to the inability of organisations and individuals who own them to complete or develop them due to lack of funds. Housing can be grouped into three broad categories: the low-income, middle-income and high-income areas. The low-income housing areas comprise Osu, Jamestown, Adedenkpo, Chorkor, La, Teshie, Nungua, Sukura, Kwashieman, Odorkor, Bubiashie, Abeka, Nima, Maamobi and Chorkor. Altogether, these areas accommodate about 58% of Accra's total population. Most of Accra's informal businesses are located in low-income areas.\nAlmost all low-income areas are built up with little room for expansion. This is particularly so in the areas of the inner city. The middle-income areas of Accra are predominantly populated by Ghanaian citizens and business, administrative and professional families. Much of the housing in these areas has been provided by state, parastatal and private sector organisations and individuals. The middle-income areas include Dansoman Estates, North Kaneshie Estates, Asylum Down, Kanda Estates, Abelempke, Achimota, Adenta and Tesano. Usually, these areas, unlike the low-income areas, are planned developments, but are in need of infrastructure services. Building materials and general housing conditions are of better quality. The middle-income group comprises 32% of the city's population of which are Ghanaian citizens make up. The high-income areas provide housing for the remaining 10% of the population of which Ghanaian citizens also make up. They include areas like North Ridge and West Ridge, Ringway Estates, north Labone Estates, Airport Residential Area, Roman Ridge, East Legon.\nThese areas are all planned and have well developed infrastructure with spacious and landscaped ground in sharp contrast with, particularly, the low-income areas.
