Accessed on April 29, 2008.</ref>\n\n''Trese'' is a horror/crime komiks title created by writer Budjette Tan and artist Kajo Baldisimo. It follows the story of Alexandra Trese, a mysterious detective who deals with crimes of supernatural origin mainly occurring in the capital region of the Philippines.\n\nAlexandra steps in to protect the streets of Manila when the police can't deal with the supernatural weirdness that appears. Whenever she's needed, Trese arrives, often called in by Captain Guerrero, the [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] to Trese's unconventional [[Batman]], a man who seems singularly predisposed to lean on her knowledge and specific skills. Supported by two mysterious and obviously magical creatures of uncertain powers \u2013 the always stylish Kambal, she's always there to protect Manila from supernatural threat.<ref name=\"fpi1\">{{cite web |url=http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2011/trese-dark-mysteries-on-the-streets-of-manilla/|title=Trese \u2013 dark mysteries on the streets of Manilla|author=Forbidden Planet International|date= Feb 10, 2012|publisher= Forbidden Planet International|accessdate=April 16, 2012 }}</ref> Comparisons to [[Hellblazer]] and [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] were supplanted in this story with a familiar feel \u2013 this has the glorious scale and import of [[Warren Ellis|Ellis]] and [[John Cassaday|Cassaday]]'s ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'', with Trese functioning as the spiritual and supernatural protector of Manila, delivering her world safe and sound, no matter what it takes, whilst we get to investigate alongside, all the weird and wonderful her mystical existence has to offer.<ref>\n{{cite web |url= http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2012/trese-more-supernatural-tales-from-manilla/|title=Trese \u2013 more supernatural tales from Manilla\u2026.|author=Forbidden Planet International|date= January 14, 2011|publisher= Forbidden Planet International|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}\n</ref> It fuses Philippine horror mythology with graphic storytelling and dark art in telling the story of Alexandra Trese, a detective who specializes in supernatural cases.<ref name=\"horror\" />\n\nOriginally intended to be released with just 13 cases, most issues were usually stand-alone cases except for issues from Mass Murders, where Case #9\u201313 are all related, using different cues from the previous books. This changed from the start of Volume 5 where the cases started to take on a more serialized progression despite still incorporating aspects of episodic storytelling per issue. Volumes 1 & 2 contain self-contained chapters 1\u20138, where it introduces to the strange and weird world on (and under) the streets of Manila. This self-contained story idea comes (as Tan says) from his idol [[Warren Ellis]] \u2013 to create a self-contained story in short, perfect tales. But again, the similarities between early [[Jamie Delano]] written Hellblazer comics is obvious \u2013 each story of Trese builds up her mystique and introduces a little more of her background in Manila, just as Delano did in [[Hellblazer#1988\u20131991: Jamie Delano .28.231\u201340.2C .2384.29|Original Sins]].\n\nIn Volume 3, Tan starts to develop the story beyond the single issue story structure he's used so far, taking us back in time to the moment where 15-year-old Alexandra Trese joined her father Anton on her first case. And along the way we find out the origins of her constant companions and bodyguards; the stylish, ultra cool and very deadly Kambal.<ref name=\"fpi1\" /><ref name=\"CRCCaytonFeature\">{{Cite web |url=https://crc.uap.asia/2019/07/26/myths-komiks-and-the-demand-for-filipino-stories-research-notes-and-insights-from-uap-literature-instructor-ria-cayton/ |title=Myths, Komiks, and the Demand for Filipino Stories: Research Notes and Insights from UA&P Literature Instructor Ria Cayton |last=De Leon |first=Remi E. |date=2019-07-26 |website=UA&P Center for Research and Communication |language=en-US |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421143046/http://crc.uap.asia/2019/07/26/myths-komiks-and-the-demand-for-filipino-stories-research-notes-and-insights-from-uap-literature-instructor-ria-cayton/?fbclid=IwAR0T891p-nhPwGvoImqC06CQAZavc3sIln0WU0rW4NDMx8KtpmBAAAf2VJU |archive-date=2020-04-21 |access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''[[Alexandra Trese]]''' \u2013 First appeared in Trese #1 Case 1.

Accessed on April 29, 2008.</ref>\n\n''Trese'' is a horror/crime komiks title created by writer Budjette Tan and artist Kajo Baldisimo. It follows the story of Alexandra Trese, a mysterious detective who deals with crimes of supernatural origin mainly occurring in the capital region of the Philippines.\n\nAlexandra steps in to protect the streets of Manila when the police can't deal with the supernatural weirdness that appears. Whenever she's needed, Trese arrives, often called in by Captain Guerrero, the [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] to Trese's unconventional [[Batman]], a man who seems singularly predisposed to lean on her knowledge and specific skills. Supported by two mysterious and obviously magical creatures of uncertain powers \u2013 the always stylish Kambal, she's always there to protect Manila from supernatural threat.<ref name=\"fpi1\">{{cite web |url=http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2011/trese-dark-mysteries-on-the-streets-of-manilla/|title=Trese \u2013 dark mysteries on the streets of Manilla|author=Forbidden Planet International|date= Feb 10, 2012|publisher= Forbidden Planet International|accessdate=April 16, 2012 }}</ref> Comparisons to [[Hellblazer]] and [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] were supplanted in this story with a familiar feel \u2013 this has the glorious scale and import of [[Warren Ellis|Ellis]] and [[John Cassaday|Cassaday]]'s ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'', with Trese functioning as the spiritual and supernatural protector of Manila, delivering her world safe and sound, no matter what it takes, whilst we get to investigate alongside, all the weird and wonderful her mystical existence has to offer.<ref>\n{{cite web |url= http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2012/trese-more-supernatural-tales-from-manilla/|title=Trese \u2013 more supernatural tales from Manilla\u2026.|author=Forbidden Planet International|date= January 14, 2011|publisher= Forbidden Planet International|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}\n</ref> It fuses Philippine horror mythology with graphic storytelling and dark art in telling the story of Alexandra Trese, a detective who specializes in supernatural cases.<ref name=\"horror\" />\n\nOriginally intended to be released with just 13 cases, most issues were usually stand-alone cases except for issues from Mass Murders, where Case #9\u201313 are all related, using different cues from the previous books. This changed from the start of Volume 5 where the cases started to take on a more serialized progression despite still incorporating aspects of episodic storytelling per issue. Volumes 1 & 2 contain self-contained chapters 1\u20138, where it introduces to the strange and weird world on (and under) the streets of Manila. This self-contained story idea comes (as Tan says) from his idol [[Warren Ellis]] \u2013 to create a self-contained story in short, perfect tales. But again, the similarities between early [[Jamie Delano]] written Hellblazer comics is obvious \u2013 each story of Trese builds up her mystique and introduces a little more of her background in Manila, just as Delano did in [[Hellblazer#1988\u20131991: Jamie Delano .28.231\u201340.2C .2384.29|Original Sins]].\n\nIn Volume 3, Tan starts to develop the story beyond the single issue story structure he's used so far, taking us back in time to the moment where 15-year-old Alexandra Trese joined her father Anton on her first case. And along the way we find out the origins of her constant companions and bodyguards; the stylish, ultra cool and very deadly Kambal.<ref name=\"fpi1\" /><ref name=\"CRCCaytonFeature\">{{Cite web |url=https://crc.uap.asia/2019/07/26/myths-komiks-and-the-demand-for-filipino-stories-research-notes-and-insights-from-uap-literature-instructor-ria-cayton/ |title=Myths, Komiks, and the Demand for Filipino Stories: Research Notes and Insights from UA&P Literature Instructor Ria Cayton |last=De Leon |first=Remi E. |date=2019-07-26 |website=UA&P Center for Research and Communication |language=en-US |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421143046/http://crc.uap.asia/2019/07/26/myths-komiks-and-the-demand-for-filipino-stories-research-notes-and-insights-from-uap-literature-instructor-ria-cayton/?fbclid=IwAR0T891p-nhPwGvoImqC06CQAZavc3sIln0WU0rW4NDMx8KtpmBAAAf2VJU |archive-date=2020-04-21 |access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''[[Alexandra Trese]]''' \u2013 First appeared in Trese #1 Case 1.
