The trio go through various adventures in their journey to find the Black Star Dragon Balls, until they encounter the artificial Tuffle parasite, [[Baby (Dragon Ball)|Baby]], who intends to destroy the Saiyan race as his revenge for their [[Genocide|extermination]] of the Tuffles many years ago.\n\nBaby has the ability to invade other people's bodies and turn them into Tuffles, as well as mutating a host's body and combining its power with his own to become an incredibly powerful warrior. After turning practically all of the Earth's population, including the Saiyans, into Tuffles, Baby decides to convert [[Vegeta]]'s body into his own and use it to kill Goku. Goku fights him and is quickly defeated, but, after having his tail regenerated by Kibito Kai and Old Kai, transforms and achieves the power of {{nihongo|Super Saiyan 4|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4{{Ruby|\u4eba|\u3058\u3093}}{{Ruby|\uff14|\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc}}|S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin F\u014d}}. In this new form, Goku easily overpowers Baby before destroying the evil Tuffle by propelling him into the sun with a {{nihongo|10x Kamehameha|\uff11\uff10\u500d\u304b\u3081\u306f\u3081\u6ce2|J\u016bbai Kamehameha|lit. \"10-Fold Turtle Destruction Wave\"}}. [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] then sacrifices himself to permanently destroy the Black Star Dragon Balls when the Earth explodes after Goku and the others help the people of Earth evacuate to Planet Plant, which Baby had wished back into existence using the Black Star Dragon Balls.\n\nA year after Baby's defeat, Dr. Myuu (Baby's creator) and [[Dr. Gero]] (creator of the [[Red Ribbon Army]] androids) create an evil replica of [[Android 17]] and have it fuse with the original Android 17, creating Super Android 17. Super 17 seems impervious to Goku's attacks, but when [[Android 18]] attacks him for murdering her husband, [[Kuririn|Krillin]], Goku takes advantage of the distraction to penetrate through Super 17 with his {{nihongo|Super Dragon Fist|\u8d85\u9f8d\u62f3|Ch\u014d Ry\u016bken}} technique, then unleashes a {{nihongo|Rapid-Fire Kamehameha|\u9023\u7d9a\u304b\u3081\u306f\u3081\u6ce2|Renzoku Kamehameha|lit. \"Continuous Turtle Destruction Wave\"}} that completely eradicates him.\n\nDue to the constant misuse of the Dragon Balls, seven [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Shadow Dragons|Shadow Dragons]] are then summoned to destroy the Earth. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated by Goku and Pan. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains tremendous power, transforming into Omega Shenron and surpassing even Super Saiyan 4 Goku's power. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but Vegeta intervenes and gains the Super Saiyan 4 transformation with help from [[Bulma]]'s newest invention, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta merge using the Fusion Dance technique to create Gogeta, who uses his immense power to beat Omega Shenron to a pulp. However, after being too confident in his ability to defeat Omega Shenron, he uses up too much time in an attempt to embarrass him. Gogeta then defuses and Goku and Vegeta revert to their base forms. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku creates the incredibly powerful {{nihongo|Universal Spirit Bomb|\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u5143\u6c17\u7389|Zensekai no Genki Dama|lit. \"Energy Sphere of the Whole World\"}} and uses it to destroy Omega Shenron once and for all.\n\nThe real [[Shenlong (Dragon Ball)|Shenron]] appears to grant Goku and his friends one last wish, and then proceeds to disappear - along with Goku and the Dragon Balls. Several decades later, Goku's great-great-grandson, Goku Jr., competes in the 64th Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai against Vegeta's descendant, Vegeta Jr., as the now-elderly Pan cheers him on. Pan then sees a rejuvenated Goku and tries to approach him, but he quickly disappears into the crowd. Goku then leaves the Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai with a flashback covering all the events of his timeline. After the flashback ends, Goku then catches his Power Pole and rides off on his Flying Nimbus cloud.\n\n== Production ==\nUnlike the previous anime series in the ''Dragon Ball'' franchise, ''Dragon Ball GT'' does not adapt the manga series written by [[Akira Toriyama]], but tells an original story conceived by the staff of [[Toei Animation]] using the same characters and universe from the original ''Dragon Ball'' manga and it continues the story where ''Dragon Ball Z'' had left off. Toriyama did, however, come up with the ''Dragon Ball GT'' name, which stands for \"Grand Tour\", in reference to the series having the characters travel through the universe, and designed the appearances of the main cast. Toriyama himself referred to ''GT'' as a \"[[Gaiden|side story]] of the original ''Dragon Ball''\".<ref name=\"GTDragonBox\">Akira Toriyama message in the ''Dragon Book'' included with the ''Dragon Ball GT'' Dragon Box DVD set.</ref>\n\nChief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's {{nihongo|Great Ape|\u5927\u733f|\u014czaru|lit. \"Great Monkey\"}} form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character; although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.<ref name=\"GoldenWarrior\">{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u96c6 \u300c\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u300d|year=2010|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=78\u201379|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-8342-8413-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe music of ''Dragon Ball GT'' was composed by Akihito Tokunaga, although the series uses five pieces of theme music by popular recording artists. [[Field of View]] performs the series opening theme, {{nihongo|\"[[Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku]]\"|DAN DAN \u5fc3\u9b45\u304b\u308c\u3066\u304f}}, which is used for all 64 episodes. {{nihongo|\"[[Hitori Janai]]\"|\u3072\u3068\u308a\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044}}, performed by [[Deen (band)|Deen]], is used for the ending theme for the first 26 episodes. Starting at episode 27, the series begins using [[Zard]]'s \"[[Don't You See!]]\" for the ending theme. Episode 42 marks the next ending theme change, with \"[[Blue Velvet (Shizuka Kud\u014d song)|Blue Velvet]]\" by [[Shizuka Kud\u014d]] being used. {{nihongo|\"[[Sabitsuita Machine Gun de Ima o Uchinuk\u014d]]\"|\u9306\u3073\u3064\u3044\u305f\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u3067\u4eca\u3092\u6483\u3061\u629c\u3053\u3046}}, performed by [[Wands (band)|Wands]], is introduced as an ending theme in episode 51. It was used as the ending theme for the remainder of the series, except for the final episode which reuses the opening theme.\n\n=== Localization ===\n[[Funimation]] licensed the series for an English language broadcast in the United States. Their English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of the series utilized their own musical score composed by Mark Menza and aired on [[Cartoon Network]] from November 7, 2003 to April 16, 2005. The company's home video release and original television broadcast both skipped the first 16 episodes of the series. Instead, Funimation created a composition episode entitled \"A Grand Problem\" which used scenes from the skipped episodes to summarize the story. The skipped episodes were later shown on Cartoon Network as \"The Lost Episodes\" after the original broadcast concluded. Funimation's English dub began re-airing in the US on [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] from January 16 to December 13, 2012, and rerun until January 2, 2015 (possibly) due to [[Adult Swim]] having rights to air ''[[Dragon Ball Z Kai]]'' through their [[Toonami]] programming block.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. TV's Nicktoons to Run Dragon Ball GT in January|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-12-15/u.s-tv-nicktoons-to-run-dragon-ball-gt-in-january|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 15, 2011|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[AB Groupe]] (in association with [[Blue Water Studios]]) produced an alternate dub for Europe and Canada and was aired on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] and [[Toonami (UK & Ireland)|Toonami UK]], which divided the episodes into two seasons while the original Japanese music composed by Akihito Tokunaga is retained in the Blue Water dub.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ytv.com/programming/shows/dragonball_gt/episodes.asp |title=Dragon Ball GT episode guide |publisher=[[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] |accessdate=June 5, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080405142512/http://www.ytv.com/programming/shows/dragonball_gt/episodes.asp |archivedate = April 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animeondvd.com/news/article.php?article_view=342 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927125905/http://www.animeondvd.com/news/article.php?article_view=342 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 27, 2004 |title=Forum Buzz: New Anime on YTV this Fall |date=August 18, 2004 |publisher=AnimeOnDVD.com |accessdate=June 5, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The AB Groupe Dub first ran in the UK from March 3, 2003 on [[CNX (TV channel)|CNX]] until August 17, 2003.\n\n== Related media ==\n===Home media===\n[[File:Dragon Ball GT Volume 1.jpg|thumb|upright|First ''Dragon Ball GT'' DVD volume, released in Japan by Toei Animation on February 6, 2008.]]\nIn Japan, ''Dragon Ball GT'' did not receive a home video release until June 15, 2005, eight years after its broadcast. This was a remastering of the series in a single 12-disc DVD box set, that was [[made-to-order]] only, referred to as a \"Dragon Box\". The content of this set began being released on mass-produced individual 6-episode DVDs on February 6, 2008 and finished with the eleventh volume released on June 4, 2008.\n\nIn North America, Funimation began releasing ''Dragon Ball GT'' on both VHS and DVD in edited and uncut formats in April 2003,<ref>{{cite news|title=FUNimation announces DBGT|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-01-18/funimation-announces-dbgt|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 18, 2003|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}</ref> starting with episode 17, after they made their own clip show episode titled 'A Grand Problem' to bring the audience up to speed with the story. After the final fifteenth volume, they released the first 16 episodes in five \"Lost Episode\" volumes between July 2004 and February 2005. They then released the series in DVD box sets; the first (beginning with episode 17) in October 2005 and finished in November 2007 with the first 16 episodes as a \"Lost Episode\" box set. Two years later, they began releasing the series again in DVD \"remastered season\" sets that finally put the episodes in proper chronological order; the first on December 9, 2008 and the second on February 10, 2009. A [[Game Boy Advance Video]] cartridge containing the episodes \"A Grand Problem\" and \"Pan's Gambit\" was released on September 7, 2004 by [[Majesco Entertainment]]. A complete series DVD box set including [[Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy|the TV special]] was later released on September 21, 2010.

The trio go through various adventures in their journey to find the Black Star Dragon Balls, until they encounter the artificial Tuffle parasite, [[Baby (Dragon Ball)|Baby]], who intends to destroy the Saiyan race as his revenge for their [[Genocide|extermination]] of the Tuffles many years ago.\n\nBaby has the ability to invade other people's bodies and turn them into Tuffles, as well as mutating a host's body and combining its power with his own to become an incredibly powerful warrior. After turning practically all of the Earth's population, including the Saiyans, into Tuffles, Baby decides to convert [[Vegeta]]'s body into his own and use it to kill Goku. Goku fights him and is quickly defeated, but, after having his tail regenerated by Kibito Kai and Old Kai, transforms and achieves the power of {{nihongo|Super Saiyan 4|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4{{Ruby|\u4eba|\u3058\u3093}}{{Ruby|\uff14|\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc}}|S\u016bp\u0101 Saiya-jin F\u014d}}.

[[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] then sacrifices himself to permanently destroy the Black Star Dragon Balls when the Earth explodes after Goku and the others help the people of Earth evacuate to Planet Plant, which Baby had wished back into existence using the Black Star Dragon Balls.\n\nA year after Baby's defeat, Dr. Myuu (Baby's creator) and [[Dr. Gero]] (creator of the [[Red Ribbon Army]] androids) create an evil replica of [[Android 17]] and have it fuse with the original Android 17, creating Super Android 17. Super 17 seems impervious to Goku's attacks, but when [[Android 18]] attacks him for murdering her husband, [[Kuririn|Krillin]], Goku takes advantage of the distraction to penetrate through Super 17 with his {{nihongo|Super Dragon Fist|\u8d85\u9f8d\u62f3|Ch\u014d Ry\u016bken}} technique, then unleashes a {{nihongo|Rapid-Fire Kamehameha|\u9023\u7d9a\u304b\u3081\u306f\u3081\u6ce2|Renzoku Kamehameha|lit. \"Continuous Turtle Destruction Wave\"}} that completely eradicates him.\n\nDue to the constant misuse of the Dragon Balls, seven [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Shadow Dragons|Shadow Dragons]] are then summoned to destroy the Earth. All but the most powerful, Syn Shenron, are defeated by Goku and Pan. Syn Shenron appears to be losing until he absorbs the Dragon Balls and gains tremendous power, transforming into Omega Shenron and surpassing even Super Saiyan 4 Goku's power. Goku is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the evil dragon, but Vegeta intervenes and gains the Super Saiyan 4 transformation with help from [[Bulma]]'s newest invention, the Blutz Wave Generator. Goku and Vegeta merge using the Fusion Dance technique to create Gogeta, who uses his immense power to beat Omega Shenron to a pulp. However, after being too confident in his ability to defeat Omega Shenron, he uses up too much time in an attempt to embarrass him. Gogeta then defuses and Goku and Vegeta revert to their base forms. Eventually, using the energy of every living being in the universe, Goku creates the incredibly powerful {{nihongo|Universal Spirit Bomb|\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u5143\u6c17\u7389|Zensekai no Genki Dama|lit. \"Energy Sphere of the Whole World\"}} and uses it to destroy Omega Shenron once and for all.\n\nThe real [[Shenlong (Dragon Ball)|Shenron]] appears to grant Goku and his friends one last wish, and then proceeds to disappear - along with Goku and the Dragon Balls. Several decades later, Goku's great-great-grandson, Goku Jr., competes in the 64th Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai against Vegeta's descendant, Vegeta Jr., as the now-elderly Pan cheers him on. Pan then sees a rejuvenated Goku and tries to approach him, but he quickly disappears into the crowd. Goku then leaves the Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai with a flashback covering all the events of his timeline. After the flashback ends, Goku then catches his Power Pole and rides off on his Flying Nimbus cloud.\n\n== Production ==\nUnlike the previous anime series in the ''Dragon Ball'' franchise, ''Dragon Ball GT'' does not adapt the manga series written by [[Akira Toriyama]], but tells an original story conceived by the staff of [[Toei Animation]] using the same characters and universe from the original ''Dragon Ball'' manga and it continues the story where ''Dragon Ball Z'' had left off. Toriyama did, however, come up with the ''Dragon Ball GT'' name, which stands for \"Grand Tour\", in reference to the series having the characters travel through the universe, and designed the appearances of the main cast. Toriyama himself referred to ''GT'' as a \"[[Gaiden|side story]] of the original ''Dragon Ball''\".<ref name=\"GTDragonBox\">Akira Toriyama message in the ''Dragon Book'' included with the ''Dragon Ball GT'' Dragon Box DVD set.</ref>\n\nChief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Super Saiyan 4 Goku, which was the idea of the show's producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan's {{nihongo|Great Ape|\u5927\u733f|\u014czaru|lit. \"Great Monkey\"}} form, he made the hair more \"wild\" and covered Goku's body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character; although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blond, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.<ref name=\"GoldenWarrior\">{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u96c6 \u300c\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u300d|year=2010|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=78\u201379|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-8342-8413-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe music of ''Dragon Ball GT'' was composed by Akihito Tokunaga, although the series uses five pieces of theme music by popular recording artists.

Starting at episode 27, the series begins using [[Zard]]'s \"[[Don't You See!]]\" for the ending theme. Episode 42 marks the next ending theme change, with \"[[Blue Velvet (Shizuka Kud\u014d song)|Blue Velvet]]\" by [[Shizuka Kud\u014d]] being used. {{nihongo|\"[[Sabitsuita Machine Gun de Ima o Uchinuk\u014d]]\"|\u9306\u3073\u3064\u3044\u305f\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u3067\u4eca\u3092\u6483\u3061\u629c\u3053\u3046}}, performed by [[Wands (band)|Wands]], is introduced as an ending theme in episode 51. It was used as the ending theme for the remainder of the series, except for the final episode which reuses the opening theme.\n\n=== Localization ===\n[[Funimation]] licensed the series for an English language broadcast in the United States. Their English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of the series utilized their own musical score composed by Mark Menza and aired on [[Cartoon Network]] from November 7, 2003 to April 16, 2005. The company's home video release and original television broadcast both skipped the first 16 episodes of the series. Instead, Funimation created a composition episode entitled \"A Grand Problem\" which used scenes from the skipped episodes to summarize the story. The skipped episodes were later shown on Cartoon Network as \"The Lost Episodes\" after the original broadcast concluded. Funimation's English dub began re-airing in the US on [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] from January 16 to December 13, 2012, and rerun until January 2, 2015 (possibly) due to [[Adult Swim]] having rights to air ''[[Dragon Ball Z Kai]]'' through their [[Toonami]] programming block.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. TV's Nicktoons to Run Dragon Ball GT in January|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-12-15/u.s-tv-nicktoons-to-run-dragon-ball-gt-in-january|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 15, 2011|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[AB Groupe]] (in association with [[Blue Water Studios]]) produced an alternate dub for Europe and Canada and was aired on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] and [[Toonami (UK & Ireland)|Toonami UK]], which divided the episodes into two seasons while the original Japanese music composed by Akihito Tokunaga is retained in the Blue Water dub.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ytv.com/programming/shows/dragonball_gt/episodes.asp |title=Dragon Ball GT episode guide |publisher=[[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] |accessdate=June 5, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080405142512/http://www.ytv.com/programming/shows/dragonball_gt/episodes.asp |archivedate = April 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animeondvd.com/news/article.php?article_view=342 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927125905/http://www.animeondvd.com/news/article.php?article_view=342 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 27, 2004 |title=Forum Buzz: New Anime on YTV this Fall |date=August 18, 2004 |publisher=AnimeOnDVD.com |accessdate=June 5, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The AB Groupe Dub first ran in the UK from March 3, 2003 on [[CNX (TV channel)|CNX]] until August 17, 2003.\n\n== Related media ==\n===Home media===\n[[File:Dragon Ball GT Volume 1.jpg|thumb|upright|First ''Dragon Ball GT'' DVD volume, released in Japan by Toei Animation on February 6, 2008.]]\nIn Japan, ''Dragon Ball GT'' did not receive a home video release until June 15, 2005, eight years after its broadcast.

After the final fifteenth volume, they released the first 16 episodes in five \"Lost Episode\" volumes between July 2004 and February 2005. They then released the series in DVD box sets; the first (beginning with episode 17) in October 2005 and finished in November 2007 with the first 16 episodes as a \"Lost Episode\" box set.
