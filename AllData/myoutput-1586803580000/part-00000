Led by Sheikh [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]], the group is estimated to have up to 300 active fighters. Since its formation, ISS probably managed to take control of a small, sparsely populated territory in northern Somalia's mountainous hinterland, though it was not acknowledged as [[ISIL territorial claims|official province]] (\"Wilayat\") by ISIL's central leadership until December 2017. Since then, it has sometimes been called '''Somalia Province''' (\"Wilayat al Somal\") by pro-ISIL media. ISS is also the declared enemy of [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], which considers the Islamic State a significant threat to its own predominance among Jihadist factions in Somalia.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins and formation ===\n[[File:LocationPuntland3.png|thumb|left|Location of [[Puntland]] (blue) in [[Somalia]] ]]\n\nThe origins of the Islamic State in Somalia trace back to 2012, when [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]] was sent by the al-Shabaab leadership to its remote outpost in Puntland, far from the insurgent group's primary areas of operation in southern Somalia. As cleric with little military experience, Mumin's role in Puntland was originally to attract recruits for the numerical small and militarily weak local al-Shabaab group, which was led by [[Mohamed Said Atom]] at the time. In course of the [[Galgala campaign]] in 2014, however, Atom defected to the government, and Mumin was forced to take control of the Puntland group. Isolated in the remote north and feeling increasingly distanced from al-Shabaab, Mumin began to consider himself more and more independent.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had launched a propaganda campaign to convince al-Shabaab to join to them, which was \"angrily refused\" by al-Shabaab's central leadership.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} Despite this, several groups of al-Shabaab members found ISIL's ideology attractive or saw this new Jihadist organization as a way to challenge al-Shabaab's leadership at the time. Thus, several small pro-ISIL groups emerged in southern Somalia. This was however not tolerated by the Somali organization, which released statements condemning dissenters{{efn|name=fn1|Al-Shabaab radio stations for example declared in November 2015: \"If anyone says he belongs to another Islamic movement [other than that of al-Qa'ida], kill him on the spot ... we will cut the throat of anyone ... if they undermine unity.\" Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mahmud Rage similarly claimed that dissenters in the organization were \"infidels\" who would be \"burnt in hell\".{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=28}} }} and ordered its internal security service Amniyat to arrest or kill pro-ISIL elements such as Hussein Abdi Gedi's faction in [[Middle Juba]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}}\n\nMumin, however, long dissatisfied with his situation, pledged ''[[bay'ah]]'' to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] and the Islamic State in October 2015. This caused a violent split within Puntland's al-Shabaab, as only 20 of the 300 local Islamist fighters joined Mumin,{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"port town\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/10/islamic-state-in-somalia-claims-capture-of-port-town.php|title=Islamic State in Somalia claims capture of port town|author=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> while the al-Shabaab loyalists attempted to kill these defectors.

In two notable incidents in November and December 2015, al-Shabaab attacked and destroyed two of the most important southern ISIL cells, namely the ones of Bashir Abu Numan and Mohammad Makkawi Ibrahim. Pro-government forces such as the [[Somali Armed Forces]] and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] also claimed to have targeted southern ISIL groups. As result, ISIL forces in southern Somialia remained very weak,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=28, 29}} and those that survived appear to have accepted Mumin's authority over time, formally becoming part of ISS.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}} As result, the \"disparate clump of pro-Islamic State cells\" in Somalia transformed into an \"organized group\".{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=29}}\n\n=== Rise in power and Qandala campaign ===\n{{further|Qandala campaign}}\n[[File:Variant flag of the Islamic State.svg|thumb|right|A variant of the Islamic State in Somalia's usual [[Black Standard|black flag]], which is also sometimes used by the group.<ref name=\"camp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/04/islamic-state-highlights-first-camp-of-the-caliphate-in-somalia.php|title=Islamic State highlights \u2018first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\u2019|author1=Bill Roggio|author2=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=25 April 2016|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2016, an ISS cell in southern Puntland was pursued by al-Shabaab fighters into [[Mudug]]; the pursuers were however attacked and completely defeated by the [[Puntland Dervish Force]] and [[Military of Galmudug|Galmudug soldiers]], thus unintentionally allowing the Islamic State militants to escape into safety.<ref name=\"puntland state\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/somalia/islamic-state-threat-somalias-puntland-state|title=The Islamic State Threat in Somalia\u2019s Puntland State |author1=Zakaria Yusuf |author2=Abdul Khalif |work=[[International Crisis Group]] |date=17 November 2016|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> From this point onwards, ISS and al-Shabaab temporarily ceased fighting each other with the exception of some isolated incidents.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} Over the following months Mumin's followers built up their strength, and by April 2016 they had set up a temporary training camp named after Bashir Abu Numan, the ISIL follower mentioned above who had been killed by al-Shabaab in November 2015.<ref name=\"camp\" />{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}} In one of the group's propaganda videos, Mumin blessed the makeshift base as the \"first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\". On 25 April, ISS also carried out its first attack on government forces, when one of its fighters detonated an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] against an [[African Union Mission to Somalia|AMISOM]] vehicle in [[Mogadishu]].<ref name=\"camp\" /> By August 2016, Mumin's cell still remained very small, probably under 100 militants, and was not yet very active. According to the [[United States Department of State]], however, ISS began to expand in size by abducting and indoctrinating boys between 10 and 15 and employing them as [[Military use of children|child soldiers]].<ref name=\"list global\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/08/us-adds-islamic-state-commander-in-somalia-to-list-of-global-terrorists.php|title=US adds Islamic State commander in Somalia to list of global terrorists|author=Bill Roggio|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=31 August 2016|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy October 2016, ISS had claimed less than one dozen attacks overall since its foundation, showing that the group was still relatively weak. Nevertheless, the fact that many of these strikes had taken place in Mogadishu, indicated that ISS had become able to operate throughout wider Somalia, not just in its core regions in Puntland.<ref name=\"port town\" /> Experts also estimated that Mumin's cell had significantly grown to up to 300 fighters. On 26 October, the group eventually launched their first major operation by [[Qandala campaign|targeting]] the major port town of [[Qandala]]. The town had both symbolic as well as strategic significance, as it could allow ISS to bolster their local support and receive more supplies from Yemen. The Islamic State fighters managed to overrun the town, meeting little resistance, and thereafter controlled it largely unchallenged until 3 December.

Peripheral areas are thus mostly ignored by the security forces and instead run by rebellious and infighting tribal militias. As result, local clans (including Mumin's own, the [[Majeerteen]] Ali Saleban) are aggrieved by their perceived marginalisation by the government and in some cases ready to support ISS.

Led by Sheikh [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]], the group is estimated to have up to 300 active fighters. Since its formation, ISS probably managed to take control of a small, sparsely populated territory in northern Somalia's mountainous hinterland, though it was not acknowledged as [[ISIL territorial claims|official province]] (\"Wilayat\") by ISIL's central leadership until December 2017. Since then, it has sometimes been called '''Somalia Province''' (\"Wilayat al Somal\") by pro-ISIL media. ISS is also the declared enemy of [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], which considers the Islamic State a significant threat to its own predominance among Jihadist factions in Somalia.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins and formation ===\n[[File:LocationPuntland3.png|thumb|left|Location of [[Puntland]] (blue) in [[Somalia]] ]]\n\nThe origins of the Islamic State in Somalia trace back to 2012, when [[Abdul Qadir Mumin]] was sent by the al-Shabaab leadership to its remote outpost in Puntland, far from the insurgent group's primary areas of operation in southern Somalia. As cleric with little military experience, Mumin's role in Puntland was originally to attract recruits for the numerical small and militarily weak local al-Shabaab group, which was led by [[Mohamed Said Atom]] at the time. In course of the [[Galgala campaign]] in 2014, however, Atom defected to the government, and Mumin was forced to take control of the Puntland group. Isolated in the remote north and feeling increasingly distanced from al-Shabaab, Mumin began to consider himself more and more independent.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had launched a propaganda campaign to convince al-Shabaab to join to them, which was \"angrily refused\" by al-Shabaab's central leadership.{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}} Despite this, several groups of al-Shabaab members found ISIL's ideology attractive or saw this new Jihadist organization as a way to challenge al-Shabaab's leadership at the time. Thus, several small pro-ISIL groups emerged in southern Somalia. This was however not tolerated by the Somali organization, which released statements condemning dissenters{{efn|name=fn1|Al-Shabaab radio stations for example declared in November 2015: \"If anyone says he belongs to another Islamic movement [other than that of al-Qa'ida], kill him on the spot ... we will cut the throat of anyone ... if they undermine unity.\" Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mahmud Rage similarly claimed that dissenters in the organization were \"infidels\" who would be \"burnt in hell\".{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=28}} }} and ordered its internal security service Amniyat to arrest or kill pro-ISIL elements such as Hussein Abdi Gedi's faction in [[Middle Juba]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}}\n\nMumin, however, long dissatisfied with his situation, pledged ''[[bay'ah]]'' to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] and the Islamic State in October 2015. This caused a violent split within Puntland's al-Shabaab, as only 20 of the 300 local Islamist fighters joined Mumin,{{sfnp|Warner|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"port town\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/10/islamic-state-in-somalia-claims-capture-of-port-town.php|title=Islamic State in Somalia claims capture of port town|author=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> while the al-Shabaab loyalists attempted to kill these defectors.

In two notable incidents in November and December 2015, al-Shabaab attacked and destroyed two of the most important southern ISIL cells, namely the ones of Bashir Abu Numan and Mohammad Makkawi Ibrahim. Pro-government forces such as the [[Somali Armed Forces]] and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] also claimed to have targeted southern ISIL groups. As result, ISIL forces in southern Somialia remained very weak,{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=28, 29}} and those that survived appear to have accepted Mumin's authority over time, formally becoming part of ISS.{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|pp=27, 28}} As result, the \"disparate clump of pro-Islamic State cells\" in Somalia transformed into an \"organized group\".{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=29}}\n\n=== Rise in power and Qandala campaign ===\n{{further|Qandala campaign}}\n[[File:Variant flag of the Islamic State.svg|thumb|right|A variant of the Islamic State in Somalia's usual [[Black Standard|black flag]], which is also sometimes used by the group.<ref name=\"camp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/04/islamic-state-highlights-first-camp-of-the-caliphate-in-somalia.php|title=Islamic State highlights \u2018first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\u2019|author1=Bill Roggio|author2=Caleb Weiss|publisher=[[Long War Journal]]|date=25 April 2016|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2016, an ISS cell in southern Puntland was pursued by al-Shabaab fighters into [[Mudug]]; the pursuers were however attacked and completely defeated by the [[Puntland Dervish Force]] and [[Military of Galmudug|Galmudug soldiers]], thus unintentionally allowing the Islamic State militants to escape into safety.<ref name=\"puntland state\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/somalia/islamic-state-threat-somalias-puntland-state|title=The Islamic State Threat in Somalia\u2019s Puntland State |author1=Zakaria Yusuf |author2=Abdul Khalif |work=[[International Crisis Group]] |date=17 November 2016|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> From this point onwards, ISS and al-Shabaab temporarily ceased fighting each other with the exception of some isolated incidents.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} Over the following months Mumin's followers built up their strength, and by April 2016 they had set up a temporary training camp named after Bashir Abu Numan, the ISIL follower mentioned above who had been killed by al-Shabaab in November 2015.<ref name=\"camp\" />{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=29}} In one of the group's propaganda videos, Mumin blessed the makeshift base as the \"first camp of the Caliphate in Somalia\".

Nevertheless, the fact that many of these strikes had taken place in Mogadishu, indicated that ISS had become able to operate throughout wider Somalia, not just in its core regions in Puntland.<ref name=\"port town\" /> Experts also estimated that Mumin's cell had significantly grown to up to 300 fighters. On 26 October, the group eventually launched their first major operation by [[Qandala campaign|targeting]] the major port town of [[Qandala]].

Peripheral areas are thus mostly ignored by the security forces and instead run by rebellious and infighting tribal militias. As result, local clans (including Mumin's own, the [[Majeerteen]] Ali Saleban) are aggrieved by their perceived marginalisation by the government and in some cases ready to support ISS. Such dissatisfied elements are the ones from which ISS receives supplies and recruits new members.<ref name=\"puntland state\" /><ref name=\"growing threat\" />{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}} There have also been accounts, however, that ISS raids those communities which do not supply it with food and other necessities,<ref name=\"surrender\" /> and to kidnap children in order to indoctrinate and train them as child soldiers.<ref name=\"list global\" /> The group is also known to collect taxes in areas which it controls or at least influences.{{sfnp|Weiss|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe group is also directly supported by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Yemen Province]], which is known to have sent experts, trainers, money, weapons and other materials to ISS.<ref name=\"vow\" /> The [[United Nations]] also claimed in November 2017 that ISS receives direct assistance from ISIL officials in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].{{sfnp|Warner|Weiss|2017|p=30}}<ref name=\"footprint\" /> In smuggling fighters and supplies across the [[Gulf of Aden]], ISS works closely with [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somali pirates]], namely Mohamed Garfanje's Hobyo-Haradhere Piracy Network and another unidentified group that is based in Qandala.
