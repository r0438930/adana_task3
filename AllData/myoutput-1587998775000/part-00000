The fits of sneezing brought about by the photic sneeze reflex can, however, have dangerous implications during certain scenarios and activities, such as operating a vehicle, or while undergoing operations (dental, optical) and having bright lights directed towards the patient's face.\n\n===Disease transmission===\nPerhaps the most universal risk of sneezing is the spread of disease. Bacterial infections can spread to susceptible uninfected people via the spread of microscopic organisms suspended in the droplets expelled by a sneeze. Bacteria which commonly spread by sneezing include bacterial [[meningitis]], [[Streptococcal pharyngitis|strep throat]], and [[tuberculosis]]. Viral infections can also be spread by sneezing. When a virus is expelled by a sneeze, its mucous membrane evaporates, and the virus becomes a droplet nucleus which can be inhaled by another person, thus spreading the virulent infection. Examples of virulent infections that spread by sneezing include [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]], and [[influenza]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cole EC, Cook CE | date = Aug 1998 | title = Characterization of infectious aerosols in health care facilities: an aid to effective engineering controls and preventive strategies | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 453\u201364 | pmid = 9721404 | doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70046-x| pmc = 7132666 }}</ref>\n\n===Vehicle operation===\nA fit of sneezing while operating a vehicle can cause the operator to lose control of that vehicle, resulting in injury to the person, and damage to the vehicle and/or surroundings. In particular, photic sneezing poses a considerable risk to pilots, due to the frequent presence of bright sunlight and the precise reactions needed to successfully control the aircraft. For the pilot of a [[fighter aircraft]], if an uncontrollable fit of sneezing were to occur during aerial combat, the pilot could be incapacitated when his or her [[situational awareness]] needs to be greatest. A plane landing on an [[aircraft carrier]] or shoreline also requires precise movements and quick reflexes. The reflection of the sun from surrounding water has a high probability of producing at least one photic sneeze for pilots who have the reflex. Any amount of sneezing while attempting to land could cause the pilot to lose control, potentially resulting in disaster.<ref name=\"Breitenbach RA 1993\"/>\n\n===Medical procedures===\nUncontrollable fits of sneezing are common in patients under [[propofol]] sedation who undergo periocular or retrobulbar injection. A sneeze by a sedated patient often occurs upon insertion of a needle into or around their eye. The violent and uncontrollable movement of the head during a reflexive sneeze has potential to cause damage within the patient's eye if the needle is not removed before the sneeze occurs.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nThere is much debate about the true cause and mechanism of the sneezing fits brought about by the photic sneeze reflex. Sneezing occurs in response to irritation in the nasal cavity, which results in an [[afferent nerve fiber]] signal propagating through the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] and maxillary branches of the [[trigeminal nerve]] to the [[trigeminal nerve nuclei]] in the brainstem. The signal is interpreted in the [[trigeminal nerve nuclei]], and an [[efferent nerve fiber]] signal goes to different parts of the body, such as [[mucous gland]]s and the [[thoracic diaphragm]], thus producing a sneeze.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | author = Abramson DC | year = 1995 | title = Sudden Unexpected Sneezing During The Insertion Of Peribulbar Block Under Propofol Sedation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Anesthesia | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 740\u2013743 | doi=10.1007/bf03012675| pmid = 7586116 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The most obvious difference between a normal sneeze and a photic sneeze is the stimulus: normal sneezes occur due to irritation in the nasal cavity, while the photic sneeze can result from a wide variety of stimuli. Some theories are below. There is also a genetic factor that increases the probability of photic sneeze reflex,.<ref name=\"Autosomal dominant transmission of\">{{cite journal|last1=Peroutka|first1=S. J.|last2=Peroutka|first2=L. A.|title=\"Autosomal dominant transmission of the \"photic sneeze reflex\"\"|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=1984|volume=310|issue=9|pages=599\u2013600|doi=10.1056/nejm198403013100923|pmid=6694722}}</ref> The C allele on the rs10427255 SNP is particularly implicated in this<ref name=\"Autosomal dominant transmission of\"/> although the mechanism is unknown by which this gene increases the probability of this response.\n\n===Optic-trigeminal summation===\nStimulation of the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] branch of the [[trigeminal nerve]] may enhance the irritability of the maxillary branch, resulting in an increased probability of sneezing. This is similar to the mechanism by which [[photophobia]] develops by persistent light exposure relaying signals through the optic nerve and [[trigeminal nerve]] to produce increased sensitivity in the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] branch. If this increased sensitivity occurred in the maxillary branch instead of the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] branch, a sneeze could result instead of photophobia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Parasympathetic generalization===\nThe [[parasympathetic nervous system]] has many neighboring fibers that respond to different stimuli. When one stimulus activates multiple nerve fibers of the parasympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic generalization is occurring. There is a possibility that sensory input from the eyes could travel to the [[neuron]]s in the cortex that interpret such signals, but neighboring neurons which are involved in sneezing are also activated, due to the generalization. This could lead to a sneeze in response to a stimulus other than nasal irritation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Increased light sensitivity===\nWhen the [[trigeminal nerve]] is directly stimulated, there is the possibility that increased light sensitivity in the ocular nerve could result. An example of directly stimulating would be plucking an eyebrow or pulling hair. In many people who show the photic sneeze reflex, even this direct stimulation can lead to a photic sneeze which is why we find it easier to sneeze while looking at a bright light.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Propofol-induced inhibitory suppression===\nUncontrollable sneezing during a periocular injection while sedated by [[propofol]] is likely caused by the drug. Propofol has been shown to temporarily suppress inhibitory neurons in the [[brainstem]], which is also where the [[trigeminal nerve nuclei|trigeminal nucleus]] \u2013 the \"sneeze center\" of the brain \u2013 lies. This chain of events leads to increased sensitivity to stimulation and reduced threshold for involuntary responses.  this hypersensitive state, the periocular injection stimulates the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] and/or maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve, which results in summation in the trigeminal nuclei. This summation can lead to a sneeze in the unconscious patient.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ahn ES, Mills DM, Meyer DR, Stasior GO |title=Sneezing reflex associated with intravenous sedation and periocular anesthetic injection|journal=[[American Journal of Ophthalmology]]|date=Jul 2008|volume=146|issue=1|pages=31\u201335|doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2008.02.013|pmid=18400200}}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nWhile this phenomenon is poorly understood, recent research has shown that [[antihistamine]]s being used to treat [[rhinitis]] due to seasonal allergies may also reduce the occurrence of photic sneezes in people affected by both conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |date=1 May 1987|title=Solar Sneeze Reflex |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=146 |page=20 |pmid=18750225 |issue=5 |pmc=1307391 }}</ref>\n\nThose affected by photic sneezing may find relief by shielding their eyes and/or faces with hats, scarves, and sunglasses,<ref name=\"Laura Dean, MD\"/> or by applying transverse pressure on the [[philtrum]] with their finger.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=30783255 | pmc=6707313 | title=Management of the photic sneeze reflex utilising the philtral pressure technique | date=July 2019 | volume=33 | issue=7 | pages=1186\u20131187 | vauthors=Bobba S, Spencer SK, Fox OJ, Agar A, Coroneo MT, Francis IC | journal=Eye | doi=10.1038/s41433-019-0368-4}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe photic sneeze effect is a genetic tendency to begin [[sneezing]], sometimes many times consecutively (due to naso-ocular reflex<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allergies.about.com/od/fa1/f/nasoocularrefle.htm |title=Allergies - Sneezing with Sunlight |publisher=Allergies.about.com |date=2013-05-12 |accessdate=2015-06-27}}</ref>), when suddenly exposed to bright light.

The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] was one of the first to contemplate this strange phenomenon in 350 BCE, exploring why looking at the sun causes a person to sneeze in [[Problems (Aristotle)|The Book of Problems]]: \"Why does the heat of the sun provoke sneezing?\"<ref>Aristotle, ''Problems'', 34.5</ref><ref>[http://www.exclassics.com/arist/arist34.htm \"Of the Nose\"], Aristotle, exclassics.com</ref><ref name=\"sciam.com\">[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=looking-at-the-sun-can-trigger-a-sneeze Looking at the Sun Can Trigger a Sneeze], Karen Schrock, ScientificAmerican.com, January 10, 2008.</ref> He hypothesized that the sun's heat caused sweating inside the nose, which triggered a sneeze in order to remove the moisture.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blitz|first1=Matt|title=The Curious Case of Sun Sneezing|website=Today I Found Out|publisher=Vacca Foeda Media|accessdate=25 May 2017|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/06/sun-sneeze/|date=2014-06-16}}</ref> In the 17th century, English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]] disproved Aristotle's theory by facing the sun with his eyes closed, which did not elicit the ordinary sneeze response. Bacon therefore guessed that the eyes played a vital part in triggering photic sneezing. He assumed that looking at the sun's light made the eyes water, and then that moisture proceeded to seep into the nose and irritate it, causing a sneeze.<ref name=\"sciam.com\"/> Although plausible, scientists later determined this theory to also be incorrect because sun-induced sneezing occurs too quickly after sunlight exposure; watering of the eyes is a slower process, so it could not play a vital part in triggering the reflex.<ref name=\"sciam.com\"/>\n\nToday, scientific attention has mainly focused on a hypothesis proposed in 1964 by Henry Everett, who was the first to call light-induced sneezing \u201cThe Photic Sneeze Effect.\u201d Since the [[nervous system]] transmits signals at an extremely fast pace, Dr. Everett hypothesized that the syndrome was linked to the human nervous system, and was perhaps caused by the confusion of nerve signals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Everett|first1=Henry C.|title=Sneezing in Response to Light|journal=Neurology|date=May 1964|volume=14|issue=5|pages=483\u2013490|doi=10.1212/wnl.14.5.483|pmid=14144120}}</ref> The genetic basis of photic sneezing still remains unclear, and single [[genes]] for this condition have not been found and studied.

Snatiation is not believed to be an allergic reaction of any kind.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hall JG|title=The Snatiation Reflex|journal=Journal of Medical Genetics|date=Apr 1990|volume=27|issue=4|page=275|doi=10.1136/jmg.27.4.275|pmid=2325110|pmc=1017036}}</ref> Even less well understood than photic sneezing and sneezing in response to periocular injection, the trait appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Teebi AS, Alsaleh QA |title= Autosomal Dominant Sneezing Disorder Provoked by Fullness of Stomach |journal= Journal of Medical Genetics |date= Aug 1989 |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages= 539\u2013540 |doi= 10.1136/jmg.26.8.539|pmid= 2769729 |pmc= 1015683 }}</ref>\n\n==Risks==\nSneezing generally does not present any particular risks to the individual, and is usually more  an annoyance than a risk of injury.  The fits of sneezing brought about by the photic sneeze reflex can, however, have dangerous implications during certain scenarios and activities, such as operating a vehicle, or while undergoing operations (dental, optical) and having bright lights directed towards the patient's face.\n\n===Disease transmission===\nPerhaps the most universal risk of sneezing is the spread of disease. Bacterial infections can spread to susceptible uninfected people via the spread of microscopic organisms suspended in the droplets expelled by a sneeze. Bacteria which commonly spread by sneezing include bacterial [[meningitis]], [[Streptococcal pharyngitis|strep throat]], and [[tuberculosis]]. Viral infections can also be spread by sneezing. When a virus is expelled by a sneeze, its mucous membrane evaporates, and the virus becomes a droplet nucleus which can be inhaled by another person, thus spreading the virulent infection. Examples of virulent infections that spread by sneezing include [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]], and [[influenza]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cole EC, Cook CE | date = Aug 1998 | title = Characterization of infectious aerosols in health care facilities: an aid to effective engineering controls and preventive strategies | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 453\u201364 | pmid = 9721404 | doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70046-x| pmc = 7132666 }}</ref>\n\n===Vehicle operation===\nA fit of sneezing while operating a vehicle can cause the operator to lose control of that vehicle, resulting in injury to the person, and damage to the vehicle and/or surroundings. In particular, photic sneezing poses a considerable risk to pilots, due to the frequent presence of bright sunlight and the precise reactions needed to successfully control the aircraft. For the pilot of a [[fighter aircraft]], if an uncontrollable fit of sneezing were to occur during aerial combat, the pilot could be incapacitated when his or her [[situational awareness]] needs to be greatest. A plane landing on an [[aircraft carrier]] or shoreline also requires precise movements and quick reflexes. The reflection of the sun from surrounding water has a high probability of producing at least one photic sneeze for pilots who have the reflex. Any amount of sneezing while attempting to land could cause the pilot to lose control, potentially resulting in disaster.<ref name=\"Breitenbach RA 1993\"/>\n\n===Medical procedures===\nUncontrollable fits of sneezing are common in patients under [[propofol]] sedation who undergo periocular or retrobulbar injection. A sneeze by a sedated patient often occurs upon insertion of a needle into or around their eye. The violent and uncontrollable movement of the head during a reflexive sneeze has potential to cause damage within the patient's eye if the needle is not removed before the sneeze occurs.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nThere is much debate about the true cause and mechanism of the sneezing fits brought about by the photic sneeze reflex. Sneezing occurs in response to irritation in the nasal cavity, which results in an [[afferent nerve fiber]] signal propagating through the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] and maxillary branches of the [[trigeminal nerve]] to the [[trigeminal nerve nuclei]] in the brainstem. The signal is interpreted in the [[trigeminal nerve nuclei]], and an [[efferent nerve fiber]] signal goes to different parts of the body, such as [[mucous gland]]s and the [[thoracic diaphragm]], thus producing a sneeze.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | author = Abramson DC | year = 1995 | title = Sudden Unexpected Sneezing During The Insertion Of Peribulbar Block Under Propofol Sedation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Anesthesia | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 740\u2013743 | doi=10.1007/bf03012675| pmid = 7586116 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The most obvious difference between a normal sneeze and a photic sneeze is the stimulus: normal sneezes occur due to irritation in the nasal cavity, while the photic sneeze can result from a wide variety of stimuli. Some theories are below. There is also a genetic factor that increases the probability of photic sneeze reflex,.<ref name=\"Autosomal dominant transmission of\">{{cite journal|last1=Peroutka|first1=S. J.|last2=Peroutka|first2=L. A.|title=\"Autosomal dominant transmission of the \"photic sneeze reflex\"\"|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=1984|volume=310|issue=9|pages=599\u2013600|doi=10.1056/nejm198403013100923|pmid=6694722}}</ref> The C allele on the rs10427255 SNP is particularly implicated in this<ref name=\"Autosomal dominant transmission of\"/> although the mechanism is unknown by which this gene increases the probability of this response.\n\n===Optic-trigeminal summation===\nStimulation of the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] branch of the [[trigeminal nerve]] may enhance the irritability of the maxillary branch, resulting in an increased probability of sneezing. This is similar to the mechanism by which [[photophobia]] develops by persistent light exposure relaying signals through the optic nerve and [[trigeminal nerve]] to produce increased sensitivity in the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] branch. If this increased sensitivity occurred in the maxillary branch instead of the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] branch, a sneeze could result instead of photophobia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Parasympathetic generalization===\nThe [[parasympathetic nervous system]] has many neighboring fibers that respond to different stimuli. When one stimulus activates multiple nerve fibers of the parasympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic generalization is occurring. There is a possibility that sensory input from the eyes could travel to the [[neuron]]s in the cortex that interpret such signals, but neighboring neurons which are involved in sneezing are also activated, due to the generalization. This could lead to a sneeze in response to a stimulus other than nasal irritation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Increased light sensitivity===\nWhen the [[trigeminal nerve]] is directly stimulated, there is the possibility that increased light sensitivity in the ocular nerve could result. An example of directly stimulating would be plucking an eyebrow or pulling hair. In many people who show the photic sneeze reflex, even this direct stimulation can lead to a photic sneeze which is why we find it easier to sneeze while looking at a bright light.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Propofol-induced inhibitory suppression===\nUncontrollable sneezing during a periocular injection while sedated by [[propofol]] is likely caused by the drug. Propofol has been shown to temporarily suppress inhibitory neurons in the [[brainstem]], which is also where the [[trigeminal nerve nuclei|trigeminal nucleus]] \u2013 the \"sneeze center\" of the brain \u2013 lies. This chain of events leads to increased sensitivity to stimulation and reduced threshold for involuntary responses.  this hypersensitive state, the periocular injection stimulates the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic]] and/or maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve, which results in summation in the trigeminal nuclei. This summation can lead to a sneeze in the unconscious patient.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ahn ES, Mills DM, Meyer DR, Stasior GO |title=Sneezing reflex associated with intravenous sedation and periocular anesthetic injection|journal=[[American Journal of Ophthalmology]]|date=Jul 2008|volume=146|issue=1|pages=31\u201335|doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2008.02.013|pmid=18400200}}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nWhile this phenomenon is poorly understood, recent research has shown that [[antihistamine]]s being used to treat [[rhinitis]] due to seasonal allergies may also reduce the occurrence of photic sneezes in people affected by both conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |date=1 May 1987|title=Solar Sneeze Reflex |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=146 |page=20 |pmid=18750225 |issue=5 |pmc=1307391 }}</ref>\n\nThose affected by photic sneezing may find relief by shielding their eyes and/or faces with hats, scarves, and sunglasses,<ref name=\"Laura Dean, MD\"/> or by applying transverse pressure on the [[philtrum]] with their finger.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=30783255 | pmc=6707313 | title=Management of the photic sneeze reflex utilising the philtral pressure technique | date=July 2019 | volume=33 | issue=7 | pages=1186\u20131187 | vauthors=Bobba S, Spencer SK, Fox OJ, Agar A, Coroneo MT, Francis IC | journal=Eye | doi=10.1038/s41433-019-0368-4}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe photic sneeze effect is a genetic tendency to begin [[sneezing]], sometimes many times consecutively (due to naso-ocular reflex<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allergies.about.com/od/fa1/f/nasoocularrefle.htm |title=Allergies - Sneezing with Sunlight |publisher=Allergies.about.com |date=2013-05-12 |accessdate=2015-06-27}}</ref>), when suddenly exposed to bright light.

The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] was one of the first to contemplate this strange phenomenon in 350 BCE, exploring why looking at the sun causes a person to sneeze in [[Problems (Aristotle)|The Book of Problems]]: \"Why does the heat of the sun provoke sneezing?\"<ref>Aristotle, ''Problems'', 34.5</ref><ref>[http://www.exclassics.com/arist/arist34.htm \"Of the Nose\"], Aristotle, exclassics.com</ref><ref name=\"sciam.com\">[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=looking-at-the-sun-can-trigger-a-sneeze Looking at the Sun Can Trigger a Sneeze], Karen Schrock, ScientificAmerican.com, January 10, 2008.</ref> He hypothesized that the sun's heat caused sweating inside the nose, which triggered a sneeze in order to remove the moisture.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blitz|first1=Matt|title=The Curious Case of Sun Sneezing|website=Today I Found Out|publisher=Vacca Foeda Media|accessdate=25 May 2017|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/06/sun-sneeze/|date=2014-06-16}}</ref> In the 17th century, English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]] disproved Aristotle's theory by facing the sun with his eyes closed, which did not elicit the ordinary sneeze response. Bacon therefore guessed that the eyes played a vital part in triggering photic sneezing. He assumed that looking at the sun's light made the eyes water, and then that moisture proceeded to seep into the nose and irritate it, causing a sneeze.<ref name=\"sciam.com\"/> Although plausible, scientists later determined this theory to also be incorrect because sun-induced sneezing occurs too quickly after sunlight exposure; watering of the eyes is a slower process, so it could not play a vital part in triggering the reflex.<ref name=\"sciam.com\"/>\n\nToday, scientific attention has mainly focused on a hypothesis proposed in 1964 by Henry Everett, who was the first to call light-induced sneezing \u201cThe Photic Sneeze Effect.\u201d Since the [[nervous system]] transmits signals at an extremely fast pace, Dr. Everett hypothesized that the syndrome was linked to the human nervous system, and was perhaps caused by the confusion of nerve signals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Everett|first1=Henry C.|title=Sneezing in Response to Light|journal=Neurology|date=May 1964|volume=14|issue=5|pages=483\u2013490|doi=10.1212/wnl.14.5.483|pmid=14144120}}</ref> The genetic basis of photic sneezing still remains unclear, and single [[genes]] for this condition have not been found and studied.
