The road no 3 is famous for boutique shops now it's a market place for clothes, The entire street is filled with boutique shops on the both side of a road it's getting famous in Mumbai now. Road no 8 is famous for sewing T shirt there are a lot of shops on that lane too same as road no 3 people come from different places to get stitching T-shirt with unique design. The  area isn't that worst anymore it used to be but The substance abuse & drugs are increasing amongst youth which must control and shall take a strict action by leaders to stop & end drugs addiction from govandi and promote quality of education. here students leave thier study at very early age because of financial issues & family condition. There various small schools started by residential itself they see as good earning & profitable business. They buy two homes on road side and somehow manage to get licence from govt. honestly They don't provide quality of education they take small amount of fees where low income group of students take admissions and somehow manage to complete their schools.\n\nThe roads condition were worsened some years back but they have been constructed and there is no hump on road anymore. People used to suffer because there is no access of water now it has been resolved and people don't have to suffer anymore but there is few access of Lavotory and toilets for the people who can not afford to construct toilets then they have no other options besides deflating feces on the street. \n\nMany labourers and daily wagers immigrated from village to earn and hoping to have a better life in this dream of city. \n\nHomes are very small because of huge population and small area the rents and the homes aren't that expensive compares to any other area of Mumbai.Small chawl(Narrow lanes) and chaos between people fight over small issues. Most of the residents have their own house they construct it well & build three floor room and give it on a rent. \n\nNot only clothing businesses are thriving but there are numerous restaurants have started food businesses are also thriving but big brands don't see govandi as a potential area because people here enjoy street foods and fried rice in regular fast food restaurants. \n\nThere are many other businesses are starting like cake shops and they are catching the immense growth one of the best cake shops  is BAKE MY CAKE after opening of this shop there are many other cake shops have opened by other people they see as a potential. \n\nSame happened with clothing and apperal businesses few years back there were only three to four shops on road no 3 but others see the potential and profitable business and start opening their own shops now the whole street is filled with boutique. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankhurd_Shivaji_Nagar_(Vidhan_Sabha_constituency)<nowiki/>{{Mumbai metropolitan area}}https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deonar\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Mumbai Suburban district]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Rv unsourced = PoV additions", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govandi"}
