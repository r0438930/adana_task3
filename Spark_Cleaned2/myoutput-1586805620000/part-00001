Ellison'' (DD-864)''' was a {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer}} in service with the [[United States Navy]] from 1945 to 1983. She was then transferred to [[Pakistan]] and renamed '''''Shah Jahan'' (D-164)'''. The ship was finally sunk as a target in 1994.\n\n==History==\nUSS ''Harold J. Ellison'' was the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] [[Harold John Ellison]], a naval aviator who died during the [[Battle of Midway]]. An earlier [[destroyer escort]] assigned the name, {{USS|Harold J. Ellison|DE-545|3}} was cancelled in 1944.\n\n===1945\u20131983===\n''Harold J. Ellison'' was laid down by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] at [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on 3 October 1944, launched on 14 March 1945 by Mrs. Audrey Ellison, the widow of Ensign Ellison and commissioned on 23 June 1945.\n\nAlthough scheduled to join the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] for the final assault on Japan, ''Harold J. Ellison'' was completing her shakedown cruise when the surrender came on 15 August 1945. Homeported at [[Naval Station Norfolk]], she operated in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] for the next two years, taking part in [[United States Navy Reserve]] training cruises, and [[anti-submarine warfare]] exercises.\n\nBeginning in 1947, when she sailed from Norfolk on 10 November, ''Harold J. Ellison'' added periodic cruises to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]] to her operations, helping to keep the peace and protect American interests in this area. She participated in the search for lost British [[submarine]] {{HMS|Affray|P421|6}} in April 1951, and added cruises to the Caribbean and northern Europe in 1953.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1956 she continued tactical training along the [[United States East Coast]] and participated in [[Western Europe|European]] cruises. Following the 1956 [[Suez crisis]], ''Harold J. Ellison'', took part in peacekeeping operations in the Eastern Mediterranean during 1957.\n\nThe following summer, the [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon crisis]] occurred as the government of [[Lebanon]]  experienced a division between pro-Western and pro-Arab sides. The destroyer screened [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|3}} and [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Des Moines|CA-134|3}} from July to September 1958 while the 6th Fleet landed [[United States Marines]] at the request of Lebanese President [[Camille Chamoun]].\n\n[[File:USS Harold J. Ellison (DD-864) underway in May 1958.jpg|thumb|left|''Harold J. Ellison'' underway in May 1958.]]\n\nIn September 1958, she operated with \"Task Group Alfa\" for the training of new tactics and equipment in antisubmarine warfare. ''Harold J. Ellison'' remained on this duty until April 1959.\n\nThe ship returned to her pattern of cruises to the Mediterranean in 1959, departing Norfolk on 21 September. In 1960, her homeport became [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and in 1961, during her tenth deployment to the 6th Fleet, the ship cruised in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Ramadan Revolution|crisis in Kuwait]]. ''Harold J. Ellison'' added a new function in January 1962, when she was assigned to [[Project Mercury]] as a part of the recovery unit in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1962, she underwent an extensive [[Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization]] (FRAM I) overhaul at the [[Brooklyn Naval Shipyard]]. The destroyer rejoined the fleet in early 1963 and through 1964 continued to operate on training and readiness exercises off the Atlantic coast.\n\nOn 29 September 1965, ''Harold J. Ellison'' departed Norfolk with Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 24 and headed via the [[Panama Canal]] for the [[Pacific Ocean]]. She served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on \"[[Yankee Station]]\" in the [[Tonkin Gulf]], participated in \"[[Operation Sea Dragon (Vietnam War)|Sea Dragon]]\" operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out [[naval gunfire support]] missions during the [[Vietnam War]]. Leaving Southeast Asia by steaming eastward through the [[Suez Canal]], she completed her round-the-world cruise upon returning to Norfolk in April 1966. In July she entered the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] for an overhaul which lasted for the rest of the year. After sea trials and refresher training early in 1967, ''Harold J. Ellison'' rejoined the [[United States Atlantic Fleet]]. She visited [[Brazil]] and crossed the equator on her way around Africa en route to the Middle East. During a port visit in [[Ethiopia]], Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] was a guest aboard the ship. ''Harold J. Ellison'' also visited [[Kenya]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Pakistan]] and returned in March 1971.\n\nIn July 1971, ''Harold J. Ellison'' was assigned to DesRon 36 and operated mainly in the Atlantic Ocean. On 1 July 1972, the destroyer was assigned to the DesRon 34 of the Navy Reserve. During the first half of 1973, she underwent an overhaul at [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. Following her yard period, she sailed the Caribbean Sea, visiting [[Port-au-Prince]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and [[Bermuda]].\n\nOn 19 July 1974, ''Harold J. Ellison'' departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean Sea with the aircraft carrier {{USS|Independence|CV-62|6}}. The destroyer was transferred to DesRon 30 on 30 November 1974 and her homeport was changed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. For her remaining career in the U.S. Navy, she continued to train reservists on cruises along the U.S. East Coast or to the Caribbean Sea. ''Harold J. Ellison'' was decommissioned on 1 October 1983. Together with {{USS|William C. Lawe|DD-763|6}}, which was decommissioned on the same day, she was the last {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer}} in the United States Navy.\n\n===Transfer to Pakistan===\n\n{{other ships|PNS Shah Jahan}}\n\n''Harold J.
