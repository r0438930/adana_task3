He was the winner of 73 races, including the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]] in Puerto Rico. Camarero is notable for setting the current world record of the most [[Winning streak (sports)|consecutive wins]] for a [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse at 56 in a series of races between April 1953 and August 1955. \n\n==Background==\nCameraro was sired by Thirteen who was a son of 1938 Travers Stakes winner Thanksgiving. His name translates to \"waiter\" in Spanish. Camarero was a small bay colt that weighed 750 pounds and stood only 14 hands high. His male line traced to [[The Finn]] and he was bred and owned by prominent [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] newspaper man Jose Coll-Vidal.<ref name= \"ny55\">New York Times.

''Camarero en punta.'' 1998.</ref> As well according to Hall of Fame Jockey Angel Cordero Jr \"he[Cameraro] means horse racing.\"\n\n== History ==\nOn July 19, 1951, Camarera foaled a black colt with four white pasterns who was named Sabrosito. Through Coll-Vidal's foal-sharing agreement with breeder Luis Rechani-Agrait, the colt was bred in Rechani-Agrait's name and foaled on his farm.\n\nA year later, Coll-Vidal and trainer Pablo Suarez first saw Sabrosito, whom Coll-Vidal said looked like a small donkey. However, Suarez insisted that Coll-Vidal take the well-bred yearling. He did and renamed the colt Camarero in honor of his dam. \n\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, Puerto Rico's economy had declined and many lived in poverty. By 1953, when Camarero began his career, only two tracks were operating.\n\nCamarero made his first start on April 14, 1953, at two furlongs at Quintana racetrack and won by three lengths. On May 17, he won his second race; seven days later, he won his first stakes race in front-running fashion by four lengths. On July 17, he won his fifth race when he took the six-furlong Luis Mu-oz Rivera Stakes by seven lengths. From August 23 to October 23, Camarero won eight more races, including another stakes. His jockey in his first 13 victories was Juan Diaz-Andino.\n\nColl-Vidal had come close to Kincsem's record with two other horses, Cofresi and Condado, who won 49 and 44 consecutive races, respectively. He believed that for Camarero to break the record, he would have to replace the colt's jockey with leading rider Mateo Matos.\n\nIn 1952, Matos exercised horses at Aqueduct for Horatio Luro but returned to Puerto Rico. When he was first asked to ride the undefeated Camarero, Matos declined. \"He wanted to sleep in peace,\" wrote Jorge Col-n-Delgado in his book about Camarero. Assured that Coll-Vidal would not replace him if he lost aboard Camarero, Matos agreed to ride the colt.\n\n\n\nCamarero recorded five more victories to finish his two-year-old campaign in 1953 with 18 wins. On New Year's Day in 1954, he won the 61/2-furlong Governor's Cup while carrying 120 pounds, eight more than the second-highest-weighted horse in the race. The Governor's Cup was the first leg of Puerto Rico's Triple Crown, which was established in 1951 and had not yet been won.\n\nThe next two legs were the 11/16-mile Jose de Diego Stakes and the 11/8-mile Primavera Stakes. Camarero could carry high weight, but it was unknown if he could race successfully at longer distances. On January 11, 1954, he won his 20th race by ten lengths while going 11/16 miles, eliminating any doubts of his ability.\n\nOn April 17, Camarero won the Jose de Diego Stakes for his 28th win. On May 9, carrying 15 pounds more than any other rival, he won the Primavera Stakes to become Puerto Rico's first Triple Crown winner. On his actual third birthday, Camarero won his 32nd race and set a 61/2-furlong track record. After winning another race ten days later, he earned a well-deserved rest.\n\nFans grew eager for Camarero's return, and on October 24, he easily won his next start. He finished his three-year-old campaign with his 37th victory on December 19 and was selected Horse of the Year.\n\nRacing's popularity in Puerto Rico increased with each of Camarero's victories. By the end of 1954, track attendance had jumped 25%. People who had never been interested in the sport paid attention to Camarero while he chased Kincsem's record.\n\n\"Some people would say that he was allowed to win, but that wasn't true,\" Cordero recalled. \"He used to win because he was the best. The only thing was he never raced against horses [that were not bred] in Puerto Rico. But in my opinion, he could have competed against any horse at the time. ... But since he was chasing the world record, they kept racing him against Puerto Rican-bred horses.\"\n\nAt four in 1955, Camarero won nine more races from January 6 to April 22 and was just nine wins away from the record. During the first 32 racing days of the year, total handle increased a whopping 64% compared with the previous year. Everyone in Puerto Rico was talking about Camarero and chanting \"Camarero en punta,\" or \"Camarero up front,\" a phrase used by track announcer Pito Rivera-Monge when the colt headed to victory.\n\nCamarero kept winning. On July 18, 1955, he won his 54th race to tie Kincsem's record. The entire country waited to see when he would race again, and the interest was covered in the New York Times. Finally, it was announced that Camarero would go for the world record on August 7 in the fourth race at Quintana.\n\nAt the start of the 6 1/2-furlong race, the eight horses broke alertly. Matos held Camarero back and looked for a good spot to place him. By the half-mile pole, Matos let Camarero go, and the colt responded to win by six lengths.\n\n\"With 600 meters to go, Camarero was already ahead and I could hear the people screaming,\" Matos recalled in Col-n-Delgado's book. \"Coming down the stretch, I knew I had the race. Camarero started to pull away easily. The closer that we would get to the finish line, the louder the people would get in the stands. It was incredible. When I passed the finish line, I remember telling myself, 'We did it. We finally did it.' \"\n\nFans shouted and hugged each other, while others cried. Elsewhere, the thousands of people who listened to the race on the radio began to rejoice, and many went out into the streets where drivers honked their horns. All of Puerto Rico celebrated.\n\n\"When Camarero established the world record, I was at the track that day,\" Cordero said. \"I was too young to fully understand what was going on. All I knew was that Camarero was our champion and that every time he raced, he would win.\"Camarero was scheduled to rest following his world-record victory, but for some reason returned ten days later and scored his 56th consecutive victory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thoroughbredtimes.com/weekly-feature-articles/2005/August/05/Camareros-record-of-56-consecutive-wins-turns-50.aspx/|title=Camarero's record of 56 consecutive wins turns 50|last=Pe-a-Rivera Owens|first=Carlos and Amy|date=|website=|url-status=archived|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531060030/http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/weekly-feature-articles/2005/August/05/Camareros-record-of-56-consecutive-wins-turns-50.aspx|archive-date=31 May 2010|access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever the win was short lived as 9 days later he would taste defeat for the first time in his career. he would go on to race 20 more times after his first defeat loosing another 3 times but managing to win another 17 more times.
