He\u2019s barely kept his job at his father\u2019s company---Detroit Electric, 1910\u2019s leading electric automobile manufacturer. Late one night, Elizabeth\u2019s new fianc\u00e9 and Will\u2019s one-time friend, John Cooper, asks Will to meet him at the car factory. He finds Cooper dead, crushed in a huge hydraulic roof press. Surprised by the police, Will panics and runs, leaving behind his cap and automobile, and buries his blood-spattered clothing in a garbage can.\n\n:What follows is a fast-paced, detail-filled ride through early-1900s Detroit, involving murder, blackmail, organized crime, the development of a wonderful friendship, and the inside story on early electric automobiles. Through it all, Will learns that clearing himself of the crime he was framed for is only the beginning. To survive, and for his loved ones to survive, he must also become a man.\n\n:''The Detroit Electric Scheme'' is populated with fascinating characters, both real and fictional, from a then-flourishing Detroit: The Dodge brothers and Edsel Ford come to life, interacting with denizens of the sordid underbelly of the Motor City, such as Vito Adamo, Detroit\u2019s first Mob boss, and Big Boy, the bouncer at a saloon so notorious the newspapers called it \u201cThe Bucket of Blood.\u201d This expertly plotted debut delivers with great research, wonderfully flawed yet likable characters, and a shattering climax.\"\n\nThe novel is the first in a series of books featuring Will Anderson.
