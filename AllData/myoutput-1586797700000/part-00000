It is a [[Grade II* listed building]].<ref name=\"NHLE\">{{NHLE|num=1228597 |desc=|accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe memorial consists of a [[statue]] mounted on a platform. Above this, rises a canopy, in the form of a [[spire]]. The whole structure is 68 feet (20.6 m) high. On three of the four sides are carved [[bas-relief]]s, representing  [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Granville Sharp]],  both prominent figures in the campaign against the slave trade, and a manacled [[Slavery|slave]] in a beseeching attitude. The fourth side bears an inscription to the memory of Clarkson.\n\n==History==\nClarkson was born in the town in 1760, the son of the Rev. John Clarkson (1710\u20131766). He attended [[Wisbech Grammar School]] where his father was headmaster before going on to [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London in 1775. His prize winning essay \"Is it right to make slaves of others against their will ?\", written whilst at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] was a turning point in his life, culminating in him turning the abolition campaign into \"one of the major issues of the day\".<ref>[http://www.wisbech-society.co.uk/clarksonmemorial.html The Wisbech Society & Preservation Trust, The Thomas Clarkson Memorial]</ref> The [[Wisbech & Fenland Museum]] houses  Clarkson's chest which contains examples of 18th century African textiles, seeds and leatherwork which he used to illustrate his case for direct trade with Africa in place of the slave trade.\n\nThe memorial is in Bridge Street, on the South Brink of the [[River Nene]]. It is on the site of the old Customs House, built in 1801, which itself replaced the Butter Market. In 1856 the Old Bridge was rebuilt, and the Customs House pulled down to make way for the bridge improvements. In 1880, when work started on the Clarkson Memorial the location was chosen because of its central position.\n\nThe Clarkson Memorial cost \u00a32,035, and was paid for primarily by a large donation from the Peckover family, local [[Quaker]] [[philanthropists]]. The shortfall was made up by public subscriptions. Work started on 28 October 1880 and the statue was unveiled on 11 November 1881  by [[Henry Brand, 1st Viscount Hampden|Sir Henry Brand]], speaker of the House of Commons and MP for Cambridgeshire.\n\nThe design was an adaption of one by [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]] [[Royal Academician|RA]], who first put forward his design in 1875. He was a brother of the Rev John Scott, vicar of St Peter's, Wisbech, 1867-86. The monument falls into a tradition of Gothic monuments for which Scott was largely responsible; his work in this line included the [[Martyrs' Memorial]] (1841-3) in Oxford, and the [[Albert Memorial]] (1876) in Hyde Park.
