The band was put together by [[Dickie Peterson]]. Peterson lived at 369 Haight Street in San Francisco, where the sixties music scene was starting to hit the high note.  Peterson had previously been with the [[Davis, California|Davis]]-based band Andrew Staples & The Oxford Circle, as well as future Blue Cheer members [[Paul Whaley]] and [[Gary Lee Yoder]].  The original Blue Cheer personnel were singer/bassist Peterson, guitarist [[Leigh Stephens]] and [[Eric Albronda]] as drummer.  Albronda was later replaced by Whaley, who was joined by Peterson's brother Jerre (guitar), [[V. Vale|Vale Hamanaka]] (keyboards), and Jere Whiting (vocals, harmonica). Albronda continued his association with Blue Cheer as a member of Blue Cheer management, as well as being the producer or co-producer of five Blue Cheer albums.<ref>''Outsideinside'', ''Blue Cheer'', ''The Original Human Being'', ''OH! Pleasant Hope'' and ''The Beast Is Back''.  See [http://www.vickibrennerent.com/bluecheer/ericalbronda.htm Profile of Eric Albronda]; www.vickibrennerent.com.</ref>\n\nThe band was managed by an inactive member of the [[Hells Angels]] named Allen \"Gut\" Terk.<ref name=RS_bluecheer/> Early on, it was decided that the lineup should be trimmed down.  It was said that Blue Cheer decided to adopt a [[power trio]] configuration after seeing [[Jimi Hendrix]] perform at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]],<ref>See [https://www.brautigan.net/chronology1960.html Portrait of Vale Hamanaka/[[V. Vale]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607223812/https://www.brautigan.net/chronology1960.html |date=June 7, 2016 }}; www.brautigan.net.</ref> but was later proven to be false.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://houseofrockinterviews.blogspot.com/2008/02/interview-with-dickie-peterson-of-blue_18.html |title=Nightwatcher's House Of Rock Interviews: Still Louder Than God : An Interview With Dickie Peterson Of Blue Cheer |publisher=Houseofrockinterviews.blogspot.com |date=February 18, 2008 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> Hamanaka and Whiting were asked to leave. Jerre Peterson didn't want to remain in the group without them, so he departed as well, leaving Dickie, Leigh and Paul as a trio.\nTheir first hit was a [[cover version]] of [[Eddie Cochran]]'s  \"[[Summertime Blues]]\"  from their debut album ''[[Vincebus Eruptum]]'' (1968). The single peaked at No.&nbsp;14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, their only such hit, and the album peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. In Canada, the song peaked at No. 3 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]] charts.\n\nThe \"Summertime Blues\" single was backed with Dickie Peterson's original song \"Out Of Focus\". Peterson also contributed to the album the eight-minute \"Doctor Please\" and \"Second Time Around\", which features Paul Whaley's frantic drum solo. Filling out the record, the band cranked out blues covers \"[[Rock Me Baby (song)|Rock Me Baby]]\" (by [[B.B. King]]) and \"[[Parchman Farm (song)|Parchman Farm]]\" ([[Mose Allison]], but retitled \"Parchment Farm\").\n\nThe group underwent several personnel changes, the first occurring after the 1968 release of ''[[Outsideinside]]'' after Leigh Stephens left the band due to musical differences or, as some report, deafness.<ref>[http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,1234.sm;jsessionid=560BD3029939720CAA6C78378A92FD8C Blue Cheer Biography] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Rockdetector.</ref> He was replaced by [[Randy Holden]], formerly of Los Angeles [[garage rock]] band [[The Other Half (band)|The Other Half]]. On 1969's ''[[New! Improved!]]'' there were different guitarists on side 1 and side 2 (Randy Holden and Bruce Stephens) due to Holden's unanticipated departure from the band. Following Holden's departure the band's lineup initially consisted of Dickie Peterson (bass), Tom Weisser (guitar), and Mitch Mitchell (drums), before Whaley returned and Bruce Stephens joined the band. Later, [[Ethan James (producer)|Ralph Burns Kellogg]] also joined the band on keyboards.<ref>Both Stephens and Kellogg had previously worked together in The Emeralds, a well-known northern California backing band in the 1960s.  The Emeralds had also toured with The [[Coasters]], [[The Olympics (band)|The Olympics]], [[The Larks]], [[Bob & Earl]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Junior Walker]], [[Ray Peterson]], and also opened shows for [[The Kinks]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Animals]], [[Chad & Jeremy]] and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]], among others.  By the time Stephens and Kellogg were asked to join Blue Cheer, both had co-founded Mint Tattoo, which had recorded one album engineered by [[Phil Ramone]] and produced by [[James William Guercio]].  While in Mint Tattoo, Stephens and Kellogg had opened shows for [[Jeff Beck]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ten Years After]], [[James Cotton]] and [[Janis Joplin]].  Bruce Stephens later played with Pilot (not the same band that had a hit with \"It's Magic\"), one of Leigh Stephen's (no relation) post-Blue Cheer projects.  One song from this period, \"Fillmore Shuffle\" was later recorded by [[Sammy Hagar]] on his second solo album, ''[[Sammy Hagar (album)|Sammy Hagar]]'' (1977).  See [http://cdbaby.com/cd/brucestephens Profile of Bruce Stephens]; www.rearwindowmusic.com, via www.cdbaby.com.</ref> Blue Cheer's style now changed to a more commercial hard rock sound \u00e0 la [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] or [[Iron Butterfly]].  By the fourth album ''[[Blue Cheer (album)|Blue Cheer]]'' Paul Whaley had left the band and had been replaced by Norman Mayell, and following the release of the fourth album Bruce Stephens also left the band<ref>Bruce Stephens continued in music, but with a much lower profile.  In early 2009, he released ''Saturday Freedom'' (Rear Window Records), being a compilation of his compositions over the past three decades. \"Rendezvous\", a song co-written by Stephens, was included in ''The Cage'', the 1982 album by [[Tygers of Pan Tang]].  Also in 1982, Stephens had released his first solo album, ''Watch That First Step'', which featured supporting performances by [[Steve Miller Band|Lonnie Turner]], [[Procol Harum|B.J. Wilson]] and [[Norton Buffalo]], among others.  Stephens has the distinction of being, at the age of sixteen, the youngest member in the history of the Musicians' Union of Sacramento, California. See [http://cdbaby.com/cd/brucestephens Profile of Bruce Stephens]; www.rearwindowmusic.com, via www.cdbaby.com.</ref> and was succeeded by [[Gary Lee Yoder]] who helped complete the album.\n\nAccording to Dickie Peterson the group's lifestyle during this period caused problems with the music industry and press. Peterson said the group was outraged by the [[Vietnam War]] and society in general.<ref name=Petersondead/>\n\n===Reconfigurations, inactivity and first extended hiatus (1970s)===\nThe new line-up of Peterson, Kellogg, Mayell and Yoder in 1970 saw the release of ''[[The Original Human Being]]'', followed by 1971's ''[[Oh! Pleasant Hope]]''. When ''Oh! Pleasant Hope'' failed to dent the sales charts, Blue Cheer temporarily split up in 1972.\n\nThere was a temporary resumption in 1974 with Peterson being joined by brother Jerry, [[Ruben De Fuentes]] (guitar)<ref>De Fuentes was also in a 1979\u20131980 version of [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] that included [[Nick St. Nicholas]] as the only original member, and which resulted in litigation from [[John Kay (musician)|John Kay]]; see [http://www.rubendefuentes.com/index.htm Ruben De Fuentes website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117034008/http://rubendefuentes.com/index.htm |date=January 17, 2009 }}; www.rubendefuentes.com.</ref> and Terry Rae (drums) for some tour dates. This grouping continued on briefly in 1975 with former Steppenwolf bassist [[Nick St. Nicholas]] replacing Dickie.  The group was then largely inactive for nearly three years, until 1978.\n\nPeterson returned in 1978\u201379 with a fresh line-up of Tony Rainier on guitar and Mike Fleck on drums.  This version of the group went out on an American tour in 1979, primarily playing nightclubs. They played only material from the first two \"heavy\" Blue Cheer albums, opening their shows with \"Summertime Blues\".\n\n===Further reconfigurations, relocation to Germany, second and third extended hiatus (1980s\u20131998)===\nBlue Cheer was once again inactive in the early 1980s. There was another attempt to reunite in 1983, but that fell through. In 1984, Peterson had better luck when he returned with Whaley and Rainier as Blue Cheer and a brand new album ''[[The Beast Is Back]]'', which was released on the New York label [[Megaforce Records]]. Whaley left again in 1985 as drummer Brent Harknett took over, only to be succeeded by Billy Carmassi in 1987. That same year, Dickie led yet another new lineup of the Cheer that had Ruben De Fuentes back on guitar and Eric Davis on drums. In 1988, the line-up changed once again, being now composed of Dickie Peterson (bass), with [[Duck MacDonald|Andrew \"Duck\" MacDonald]] (guitar) and Dave Salce (drums).\n\nFrom 1989 to 1993, Blue Cheer toured mainly in Europe. During this time, they played with classic rock acts as well as then-up-and-coming bands: [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]], [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]], [[Thunder (band)|Thunder]], [[The Groundhogs]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Mucky Pup]], Biohazard and others.\n\n1989 saw the release of Blue Cheer's first official live album, ''Blitzkrieg over N\u00fcremberg''. This album was recorded during Blue Cheer's first European tour in decades.\n\n1990 saw the release of the ''[[Highlights and Lowlives]]'' studio album, composed of blues-based [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and one ballad.  The album was co-produced by notable grunge producer [[Jack Endino]] and producer Roland Hofmann. The line-up was Peterson, Whaley on drums and MacDonald on guitars.<ref>[http://www.deaddisc.com/ot/Highlights_And_Low_Lives.htm Credits: ''Highlights and Lowlives'']; www.deaddisc.com.</ref>\n\nBlue Cheer followed up \"Highlights\" with the much heavier ''Dining with the Sharks''. '''Duck MacDonald''' was replaced by German ex-Monsters<ref>A band that continues to remain active.

Also featured is a special guest appearance by [[The Groundhogs|Groundhogs]] guitarist [[Tony McPhee]]. The album was co-produced by Roland Hofmann and Blue Cheer.<ref>[http://www.deaddisc.com/ot/Dining_With_The_Sharks.htm Credits: ''Dining With The Sharks'']; www.deaddisc.com.</ref> [[Gary Holland]] (ex-[[Dokken]]/[[Great White]]/[[Britton (band)|Britton]]) replaced Whaley on drums in 1993.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Peterson and Whaley re-located to Germany. In 1992 Peterson recorded his first solo album ''Child of the Darkness'' in Cologne with a band named \"The Scrap Yard\". The album appeared five years later in Japan on Captain Trip Records. After Peterson came back to the U.S. (1994), Blue Cheer was dormant from 1994 to 1999.\n\n===The return of Blue Cheer (1999\u20132009)===\nIn 1999, Peterson & Whaley got together with guitarist MacDonald to resume touring as Blue Cheer. This band configuration remained largely constant from 1999 until Peterson's death in 2009.\n\nIn 2000, Blue Cheer was the subject of a tribute album, ''Blue Explosion \u2013 A Tribute to Blue Cheer'', featuring such bands as [[Pentagram (band)|Pentagram]], [[Internal Void]], Hogwash and [[Thumlock]].\n\nPeterson and Leigh Stephens were together once again in Blue Cheer with drummer [[Prairie Prince]] at the [[Chet Helms|Chet Helms Memorial Tribal Stomp]] in San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]] on October 29, 2005, and their lively performance drew old rockers like [[Paul Kantner]] and others from backstage to observe. They did some recordings in [[Virginia]] in Winter 2005 with [[Joe Hasselvander]] of [[Raven (band)|Raven]] and [[Pentagram (band)|Pentagram]] on drums, due to Paul Whaley choosing to remain in Germany. While Hasselvander played on the entire album, his contribution was reduced to drums on five songs, with Paul Whaley re-recording the drum parts on the balance of the album.  This was because Whaley was set to rejoin the band and it was felt that he should contribute to the album, prior to touring.  The resulting CD, ''[[What Doesn't Kill You... (Blue Cheer album)|What Doesn't Kill You...]]'', released in 2007, features contributions from both Whaley and Hasselvander as a consequence.<ref>[http://metalmark.blogspot.com/2008/03/interview-with-joe-hasselvander.html Interview with Joe Hasselvander] by Metal Mark, March 2008; \"Heavy Metal Time Machine\".

It was reported that, as of the early 2000s (decade), former Blue Cheer guitarist [[Randy Holden]], assisted by Randy Pratt of The Lizards band, had trademarked the Blue Cheer band name. Holden's association with Blue Cheer was quite brief; his only recorded output with the band is three tracks on ''[[New!

It is unclear whether this was a side project or principal activity of Peterson, particularly since there were no Blue Cheer recordings released during this period and the extent of Blue Cheer's touring activity is uncertain.

The band was put together by [[Dickie Peterson]]. Peterson lived at 369 Haight Street in San Francisco, where the sixties music scene was starting to hit the high note.  Peterson had previously been with the [[Davis, California|Davis]]-based band Andrew Staples & The Oxford Circle, as well as future Blue Cheer members [[Paul Whaley]] and [[Gary Lee Yoder]].  The original Blue Cheer personnel were singer/bassist Peterson, guitarist [[Leigh Stephens]] and [[Eric Albronda]] as drummer.  Albronda was later replaced by Whaley, who was joined by Peterson's brother Jerre (guitar), [[V. Vale|Vale Hamanaka]] (keyboards), and Jere Whiting (vocals, harmonica). Albronda continued his association with Blue Cheer as a member of Blue Cheer management, as well as being the producer or co-producer of five Blue Cheer albums.<ref>''Outsideinside'', ''Blue Cheer'', ''The Original Human Being'', ''OH! Pleasant Hope'' and ''The Beast Is Back''.  See [http://www.vickibrennerent.com/bluecheer/ericalbronda.htm Profile of Eric Albronda]; www.vickibrennerent.com.</ref>\n\nThe band was managed by an inactive member of the [[Hells Angels]] named Allen \"Gut\" Terk.<ref name=RS_bluecheer/> Early on, it was decided that the lineup should be trimmed down.  It was said that Blue Cheer decided to adopt a [[power trio]] configuration after seeing [[Jimi Hendrix]] perform at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]],<ref>See [https://www.brautigan.net/chronology1960.html Portrait of Vale Hamanaka/[[V. Vale]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607223812/https://www.brautigan.net/chronology1960.html |date=June 7, 2016 }}; www.brautigan.net.</ref> but was later proven to be false.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://houseofrockinterviews.blogspot.com/2008/02/interview-with-dickie-peterson-of-blue_18.html |title=Nightwatcher's House Of Rock Interviews: Still Louder Than God : An Interview With Dickie Peterson Of Blue Cheer |publisher=Houseofrockinterviews.blogspot.com |date=February 18, 2008 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> Hamanaka and Whiting were asked to leave. Jerre Peterson didn't want to remain in the group without them, so he departed as well, leaving Dickie, Leigh and Paul as a trio.\nTheir first hit was a [[cover version]] of [[Eddie Cochran]]'s  \"[[Summertime Blues]]\"  from their debut album ''[[Vincebus Eruptum]]'' (1968). The single peaked at No.&nbsp;14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, their only such hit, and the album peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. In Canada, the song peaked at No. 3 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]] charts.\n\nThe \"Summertime Blues\" single was backed with Dickie Peterson's original song \"Out Of Focus\". Peterson also contributed to the album the eight-minute \"Doctor Please\" and \"Second Time Around\", which features Paul Whaley's frantic drum solo. Filling out the record, the band cranked out blues covers \"[[Rock Me Baby (song)|Rock Me Baby]]\" (by [[B.B. King]]) and \"[[Parchman Farm (song)|Parchman Farm]]\" ([[Mose Allison]], but retitled \"Parchment Farm\").\n\nThe group underwent several personnel changes, the first occurring after the 1968 release of ''[[Outsideinside]]'' after Leigh Stephens left the band due to musical differences or, as some report, deafness.<ref>[http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,1234.sm;jsessionid=560BD3029939720CAA6C78378A92FD8C Blue Cheer Biography] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Rockdetector.</ref> He was replaced by [[Randy Holden]], formerly of Los Angeles [[garage rock]] band [[The Other Half (band)|The Other Half]]. On 1969's ''[[New! Improved!]]'' there were different guitarists on side 1 and side 2 (Randy Holden and Bruce Stephens) due to Holden's unanticipated departure from the band. Following Holden's departure the band's lineup initially consisted of Dickie Peterson (bass), Tom Weisser (guitar), and Mitch Mitchell (drums), before Whaley returned and Bruce Stephens joined the band. Later, [[Ethan James (producer)|Ralph Burns Kellogg]] also joined the band on keyboards.<ref>Both Stephens and Kellogg had previously worked together in The Emeralds, a well-known northern California backing band in the 1960s.  The Emeralds had also toured with The [[Coasters]], [[The Olympics (band)|The Olympics]], [[The Larks]], [[Bob & Earl]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Junior Walker]], [[Ray Peterson]], and also opened shows for [[The Kinks]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Animals]], [[Chad & Jeremy]] and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]], among others.  By the time Stephens and Kellogg were asked to join Blue Cheer, both had co-founded Mint Tattoo, which had recorded one album engineered by [[Phil Ramone]] and produced by [[James William Guercio]].  While in Mint Tattoo, Stephens and Kellogg had opened shows for [[Jeff Beck]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ten Years After]], [[James Cotton]] and [[Janis Joplin]].  Bruce Stephens later played with Pilot (not the same band that had a hit with \"It's Magic\"), one of Leigh Stephen's (no relation) post-Blue Cheer projects.  One song from this period, \"Fillmore Shuffle\" was later recorded by [[Sammy Hagar]] on his second solo album, ''[[Sammy Hagar (album)|Sammy Hagar]]'' (1977).  See [http://cdbaby.com/cd/brucestephens Profile of Bruce Stephens]; www.rearwindowmusic.com, via www.cdbaby.com.</ref> Blue Cheer's style now changed to a more commercial hard rock sound \u00e0 la [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] or [[Iron Butterfly]].  By the fourth album ''[[Blue Cheer (album)|Blue Cheer]]'' Paul Whaley had left the band and had been replaced by Norman Mayell, and following the release of the fourth album Bruce Stephens also left the band<ref>Bruce Stephens continued in music, but with a much lower profile.  In early 2009, he released ''Saturday Freedom'' (Rear Window Records), being a compilation of his compositions over the past three decades. \"Rendezvous\", a song co-written by Stephens, was included in ''The Cage'', the 1982 album by [[Tygers of Pan Tang]].  Also in 1982, Stephens had released his first solo album, ''Watch That First Step'', which featured supporting performances by [[Steve Miller Band|Lonnie Turner]], [[Procol Harum|B.J. Wilson]] and [[Norton Buffalo]], among others.  Stephens has the distinction of being, at the age of sixteen, the youngest member in the history of the Musicians' Union of Sacramento, California. See [http://cdbaby.com/cd/brucestephens Profile of Bruce Stephens]; www.rearwindowmusic.com, via www.cdbaby.com.</ref> and was succeeded by [[Gary Lee Yoder]] who helped complete the album.\n\nAccording to Dickie Peterson the group's lifestyle during this period caused problems with the music industry and press. Peterson said the group was outraged by the [[Vietnam War]] and society in general.<ref name=Petersondead/>\n\n===Reconfigurations, inactivity and first extended hiatus (1970s)===\nThe new line-up of Peterson, Kellogg, Mayell and Yoder in 1970 saw the release of ''[[The Original Human Being]]'', followed by 1971's ''[[Oh! Pleasant Hope]]''. When ''Oh! Pleasant Hope'' failed to dent the sales charts, Blue Cheer temporarily split up in 1972.\n\nThere was a temporary resumption in 1974 with Peterson being joined by brother Jerry, [[Ruben De Fuentes]] (guitar)<ref>De Fuentes was also in a 1979\u20131980 version of [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] that included [[Nick St. Nicholas]] as the only original member, and which resulted in litigation from [[John Kay (musician)|John Kay]]; see [http://www.rubendefuentes.com/index.htm Ruben De Fuentes website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117034008/http://rubendefuentes.com/index.htm |date=January 17, 2009 }}; www.rubendefuentes.com.</ref> and Terry Rae (drums) for some tour dates. This grouping continued on briefly in 1975 with former Steppenwolf bassist [[Nick St. Nicholas]] replacing Dickie.  The group was then largely inactive for nearly three years, until 1978.\n\nPeterson returned in 1978\u201379 with a fresh line-up of Tony Rainier on guitar and Mike Fleck on drums.  This version of the group went out on an American tour in 1979, primarily playing nightclubs. They played only material from the first two \"heavy\" Blue Cheer albums, opening their shows with \"Summertime Blues\".\n\n===Further reconfigurations, relocation to Germany, second and third extended hiatus (1980s\u20131998)===\nBlue Cheer was once again inactive in the early 1980s. There was another attempt to reunite in 1983, but that fell through. In 1984, Peterson had better luck when he returned with Whaley and Rainier as Blue Cheer and a brand new album ''[[The Beast Is Back]]'', which was released on the New York label [[Megaforce Records]]. Whaley left again in 1985 as drummer Brent Harknett took over, only to be succeeded by Billy Carmassi in 1987. That same year, Dickie led yet another new lineup of the Cheer that had Ruben De Fuentes back on guitar and Eric Davis on drums. In 1988, the line-up changed once again, being now composed of Dickie Peterson (bass), with [[Duck MacDonald|Andrew \"Duck\" MacDonald]] (guitar) and Dave Salce (drums).\n\nFrom 1989 to 1993, Blue Cheer toured mainly in Europe. During this time, they played with classic rock acts as well as then-up-and-coming bands: [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]], [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]], [[Thunder (band)|Thunder]], [[The Groundhogs]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Mucky Pup]], Biohazard and others.\n\n1989 saw the release of Blue Cheer's first official live album, ''Blitzkrieg over N\u00fcremberg''. This album was recorded during Blue Cheer's first European tour in decades.\n\n1990 saw the release of the ''[[Highlights and Lowlives]]'' studio album, composed of blues-based [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and one ballad.  The album was co-produced by notable grunge producer [[Jack Endino]] and producer Roland Hofmann. The line-up was Peterson, Whaley on drums and MacDonald on guitars.<ref>[http://www.deaddisc.com/ot/Highlights_And_Low_Lives.htm Credits: ''Highlights and Lowlives'']; www.deaddisc.com.</ref>\n\nBlue Cheer followed up \"Highlights\" with the much heavier ''Dining with the Sharks''.

Also featured is a special guest appearance by [[The Groundhogs|Groundhogs]] guitarist [[Tony McPhee]]. The album was co-produced by Roland Hofmann and Blue Cheer.<ref>[http://www.deaddisc.com/ot/Dining_With_The_Sharks.htm Credits: ''Dining With The Sharks'']; www.deaddisc.com.</ref> [[Gary Holland]] (ex-[[Dokken]]/[[Great White]]/[[Britton (band)|Britton]]) replaced Whaley on drums in 1993.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Peterson and Whaley re-located to Germany. In 1992 Peterson recorded his first solo album ''Child of the Darkness'' in Cologne with a band named \"The Scrap Yard\". The album appeared five years later in Japan on Captain Trip Records. After Peterson came back to the U.S. (1994), Blue Cheer was dormant from 1994 to 1999.\n\n===The return of Blue Cheer (1999\u20132009)===\nIn 1999, Peterson & Whaley got together with guitarist MacDonald to resume touring as Blue Cheer. This band configuration remained largely constant from 1999 until Peterson's death in 2009.\n\nIn 2000, Blue Cheer was the subject of a tribute album, ''Blue Explosion \u2013 A Tribute to Blue Cheer'', featuring such bands as [[Pentagram (band)|Pentagram]], [[Internal Void]], Hogwash and [[Thumlock]].\n\nPeterson and Leigh Stephens were together once again in Blue Cheer with drummer [[Prairie Prince]] at the [[Chet Helms|Chet Helms Memorial Tribal Stomp]] in San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]] on October 29, 2005, and their lively performance drew old rockers like [[Paul Kantner]] and others from backstage to observe. They did some recordings in [[Virginia]] in Winter 2005 with [[Joe Hasselvander]] of [[Raven (band)|Raven]] and [[Pentagram (band)|Pentagram]] on drums, due to Paul Whaley choosing to remain in Germany. While Hasselvander played on the entire album, his contribution was reduced to drums on five songs, with Paul Whaley re-recording the drum parts on the balance of the album.  This was because Whaley was set to rejoin the band and it was felt that he should contribute to the album, prior to touring.  The resulting CD, ''[[What Doesn't Kill You... (Blue Cheer album)|What Doesn't Kill You...]]'', released in 2007, features contributions from both Whaley and Hasselvander as a consequence.<ref>[http://metalmark.blogspot.com/2008/03/interview-with-joe-hasselvander.html Interview with Joe Hasselvander] by Metal Mark, March 2008; \"Heavy Metal Time Machine\".

It was reported that, as of the early 2000s (decade), former Blue Cheer guitarist [[Randy Holden]], assisted by Randy Pratt of The Lizards band, had trademarked the Blue Cheer band name. Holden's association with Blue Cheer was quite brief; his only recorded output with the band is three tracks on ''[[New!
