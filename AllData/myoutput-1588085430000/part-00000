It also has 150 edges, and 60 vertices.\n\nIt has two distinct forms, which are [[mirror image]]s (or \"[[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]]\") of each other. The union of both forms is a [[compound of two snub dodecahedra]], and the [[convex hull]] of both forms is a [[truncated icosidodecahedron]].\n\n[[Kepler]] first named it in [[Latin]] as '''dodecahedron simum''' in 1619 in his [[Harmonices Mundi]].
