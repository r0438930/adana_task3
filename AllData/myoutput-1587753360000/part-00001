It is reported in his biographies that his father had a dream before his birth in which he saw Sayyadna [[Ali]], who told him to name the baby on his name (''Ali''). After he grew up, he modified his own name to be '''Ghulam Ali''' (literally meaning slave of Ali, a common name in Indian Muslims today). Similarly, his mother had a dream in which she saw [[Muhammad]], who told her to name the baby ''Abdullah''. Hence his real name is still known as '''Abdullah''' while his alias is '''Ghulam Ali'''.\n\nHe is reported to have memorized the [[Quran]] in a single month's duration.<ref name=Ghaffari/> In 1170 AH he came to Delhi to take the oath of allegiance to [[Mirza Mazhar Jan-e-Janaan]], who was a famous Shaykh of [[Naqshbandi]] tariqah in Delhi at that time. After getting trained in the major Sufi orders including [[Naqshbandi]] for 15 years, he received complete Khilafat (spiritual [[Ijazah]]) from his Shaykh.<ref name=Ghaffari/>\n\nHe had many Khulafa (deputies) who spread the [[Naqshbandi]] Sufi order to a vast number of people in the whole Muslim world at that time. His Khulafa went to [[Bukhara]], [[Baghdad]], [[Madinah]] and [[Turkey]]. His famous khalifa was Mawlana [[Khalid al-Baghdadi]], who had hundreds of thousands of followers in his lifetime, and many [[Naqshbandi]]'s today in Turkey and nearby countries follow him. His chief deputy and successor was [Hafiz Abu-Saeed-Ahmadi Faruqi Mujaddidi Naqshbandi]] ([[Delhi]]) and his next successor was Hafiz Shah Ahmed Saeed Faruqi Mujaddidi, son of Hafiz Shah Abu Saeed ([[Medina]]) <ref name=Ghaffari/>\n\nHe is quoted to have said: \"My Faid (spirituality) has reached far off countries.
