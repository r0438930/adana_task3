Retrieved on 2008-09-12.</ref> document authored by American [[Capital punishment|execution]] technician [[Fred A. Leuchter]], who was commissioned by [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]] to defend him at his trial in Canada for distributing [[Holocaust denial]] material. Leuchter compiled the report in 1988 with the intention of investigating the feasibility of mass homicidal [[gas chamber|gassings]] at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, specifically at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. He travelled to the camp, collected multiple pieces of brick from the remains of the crematoria and gas chambers (without the camp's permission), brought them back to the United States, and submitted them for chemical analysis. At the trial, Leuchter was called upon to defend the report in the capacity of an expert witness; however during the trial, the court ruled that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such.\n\nLeuchter cited the absence of [[Prussian blue]] in the homicidal gas chambers to support his view that they could not have been used to gas people. However, residual iron-based [[cyanide]] compounds are not a categorical consequence of cyanide exposure. By not discriminating against that, Leuchter introduced an unreliable factor into his experiment, and his findings were seriously flawed as a result. In contrast, tests conducted by Polish forensic scientists (who discriminated against iron-based compounds) confirmed the presence of cyanide in the locations[6], in accordance with where and how it was used in [[the Holocaust]]. In addition, the report was criticized as Leuchter had overlooked critical evidence, such as documents in the SS architectural office which recorded the mechanical operation of the gas chambers and others which verified the rate at which the Nazis could burn the bodies of those gassed.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1985, [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]], a German pamphleteer and publisher living in Canada, was put on trial for publishing [[Richard Verrall (political writer)|Richard Verrall]]'s Holocaust denial pamphlet ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'', which was deemed to violate Canadian laws against distributing false news. Z\u00fcndel was found guilty, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. This led to a second prosecution.\n\nZ\u00fcndel and his lawyers were joined by [[Robert Faurisson]], a French academic of literature and Holocaust denier, who came to Toronto to advise the defence,<ref name=Lipstadt>[[Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt, Deborah]]. ''Denying the Holocaust&mdash;The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory''. Free Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-02-919235-8}}</ref>{{rp|160}} having previously testified as expert witness at the first trial.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|161}} He was joined by [[David Irving]], an English writer and Holocaust denier, who was to assist the defence and testify on Z\u00fcndel's behalf.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|161}} Faurisson claimed that it was technically and physically impossible for the gas chambers at Auschwitz to have functioned as extermination facilities, based on comparisons with American execution gas chambers; he therefore suggested getting an American prison warden who had participated in executions by gas to testify.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|162}} Irving and Faurisson therefore invited Bill Armontrout, warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary,<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|162}} who agreed to testify and suggested they contact Fred A. Leuchter, a Bostonian execution equipment designer. Faurisson reported that Leuchter initially accepted the mainstream account of the Holocaust, but after two days of discussion with him, he stated that Leuchter was convinced that homicidal gassings never occurred. After having met Z\u00fcndel in Toronto and agreeing to serve as an expert witness for his defence, Leuchter travelled with them to spend a week in Poland.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|162}} He was accompanied by his draftsman, a cinematographer supplied by Z\u00fcndel, a translator fluent in German and Polish, and his wife. Although Z\u00fcndel and Faurisson did not accompany them, Leuchter said that they were with them \"every step of the way\" in spirit.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|162}}\n\nAfter arriving in Poland the group spent three days at the former [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp site, and another at the former [[Majdanek]] concentration camp. At these, they filmed Leuchter illicitly collecting what he regarded to be forensic quality samples of materials<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|163}}from the wreckage of the former gas extermination facilities,<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|162}} while his wife and the translator acted as lookouts.<ref name=\"transcript\">{{Cite news| url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html| title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=| year=2006 | first=Errol | last=Morris | accessdate = 2008-05-17}}</ref> Drawings of where the samples were taken from, the film footage of their physical collection and Leuchter's notebook detailing the work were surrendered to the trial court as evidence.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> Leuchter claimed that his conclusions were based on his expert knowledge of gas chamber operation, his visual inspection of what remained of the structures at Auschwitz, and original drawings and blueprints of some of the facilities.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|163}} He said that the blueprints had been given to him by Auschwitz Museum officials.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|163}}\n\n==Report==\nThe compiled report was published in Canada as ''The Leuchter Report: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek, Poland'', by Z\u00fcndel's Samisdat Publications, and in England as ''Auschwitz: The End of the Line. The Leuchter Report: The First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz'' by Focal Point Publications, David Irving's publishing house.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|163}} However, the court accepted the report only as evidentiary display and not as direct evidence; Leuchter was therefore required to explain it and testify to its veracity in the trial.<ref name=\"transcript\"/>\n\nBefore Leuchter could do this, he was examined by the court. He admitted that he was not a toxicologist and dismissed the need for having a degree in engineering:\n\n{{Quote|text=THE COURT: How do you function as an engineer if you don't have an engineering degree?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Well, I would question, Your Honour, what an engineering degree is. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and I have the required background training both on the college level and in the field to perform my function as an engineer.\n\nTHE COURT: Who determines that? You?\n\n|sign=Exchange between Leuchter and Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Z\u00fcndel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 8973.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|164}}}}\n\nLeuchter admitted under oath that he only had a bachelor of arts degree and implicitly suggested that an engineering degree was unavailable to him by saying that his college did not offer an engineering degree during his studies. [[Boston University]] actually offered three different kinds of such qualification when he was a student there.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|165}} When asked by the court if the B.A. he obtained was in a field that entitled him to operate as an engineer, he confirmed that this was so, even though his degree was in history.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|165}} Similarly, Leuchter claimed that he obtained most of his research material on the camps (including original crematoria blueprints) from the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps' archives, and testified that these documents had a far more important role in shaping his conclusions than the physical samples he collected, yet after the trial the director of the Auschwitz museum denied that Leuchter had received any plans or blueprints from them.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|165}}\n\nJudge Ronald Thomas began to label Leuchter's methodology as \"ridiculous\" and \"preposterous\", dismissing many of the report's conclusions on the basis that they were based on \"second-hand information\", and refused to allow him to testify on the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on humans because he had never worked with the substance, and was neither a toxicologist nor a chemist.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|166}} Judge Thomas dismissed Leuchter's opinion because it was of \"no greater value than that of an ordinary tourist\", and in regards to Leuchter's opinion said:\n\n{{Quote|text=His opinion on this report is that there were never any gassings or there was never any exterminations carried on in this facility.

DuPont, the largest American manufacturer of hydrogen cyanide, stated that it had \"never provided any information on cyanides to persons representing themselves as Holocaust deniers, including Fred Leuchter\", and had \"never provided any information regarding the use of cyanide at Auschwitz, Birkenau or Majdanek.\"<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|166}}\n\n==Claims and criticism==\nThe contents of the report, in particular Leuchter's methodology, are heavily criticised. James Roth, the manager of the lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, swore under oath to the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometres, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analysing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.<ref name=\"transcript\"/>\n\n===Prussian blue===\nLeuchter's opposition to the possibility of homicidal gassings at Auschwitz relies on residual cyanide remains found in the homicidal gas chambers and delousing chambers at Auschwitz.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|167}} While both facilities were exposed to the same substance ([[Zyklon B]]), many of the delousing chambers are stained with an iron based compound known as Prussian blue, which is not apparent in the homicidal gas chambers.<ref name=\"ironblues\">{{Cite news|url=http://phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/blue/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Leuchter, Rudolf, and the Iron Blues|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> It is not only this disparity that Leuchter cites, but accordingly from his samples (which included measurements of it) that he claims he measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the gas chambers, which he argues is inconsistent between the amounts necessary to kill human beings and lice.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|167}} This argument is often cited by Holocaust deniers, and similar claims are also made by [[Germar Rudolf]].\n\nAccording to [[Richard J. Green]]:\n\n{{Quote|text=In order for Leuchter or Rudolf to demonstrate the significance of their findings, it is necessary for them to prove the necessity of Prussian blue formation under the conditions that the homicidal gas chambers were operated. Showing that the delousing chambers have Prussian blue and that the homicidal gas chambers do not, proves nothing, if it cannot be shown that conditions in the gas chambers were such as to produce Prussian blue.<ref name=ironblues/>}}\n\nIn other words, Green states that Leuchter failed to show that Prussian Blue would have been produced in the homicidal gas chambers in the first place\u2014meaning its absence is not in itself proof that no homicidal gassings took place.<ref name=\"chemistry\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=The Chemistry of Auschwitz|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Majdanek Komora Gazowa.JPG|thumbnail|Gas chamber in [[Majdanek concentration camp]] with blue residue]]\nThe problem with Prussian blue is that it is by no means a categorical sign of cyanide exposure.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/> One factor necessary in its formation is a very high concentration of cyanide.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/> In terms of the difference between amounts measured in the delousing chambers and homicidal gas chambers, critics explain that the exact opposite of what deniers claim is true. Insects have a far higher resistance to cyanide than humans, with concentration levels up to 16,000ppm (parts per million) and an exposure time of more than 20 hours<ref name=\"chemistry\"/> (sometimes as long as 72 hours) being necessary for them to succumb. In contrast, a cyanide concentration of only 300ppm is fatal to humans in a matter of minutes.<ref name=\"science\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Chemistry is Not the Science: Rudolf, Rhetoric, and Reduction|accessdate=2008-05-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604152626/http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|archivedate=2008-06-04}}</ref> This difference is one of the reasons behind the concentration disparity. Another exceedingly sensitive factor by which very small deviances could determine whether Prussian blue may form is [[pH]]. pH could be affected by the presence of human beings.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/> Also, while the delousing chambers were left intact, the ruins of the crematoria at Birkenau had been exposed to the elements for over forty years by the time Leuchter collected his samples. This would have severely affected his results, because unlike Prussian blue and other iron based cyanides, cyanide salts are highly soluble in water.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/>\n\nSince the formation of Prussian blue is not an unconditional outcome of exposure to cyanide, it is not a reliable indicator. Leuchter and Rudolf claim to have measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the homicidal gas chambers, but since they did not discriminate against an unreliable factor, Green maintains that instant bias is introduced into their experiments.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/> Similarly, Rudolf acknowledges that Prussian blue does not always form upon exposure to cyanide and is thus not a reliable marker, yet continues to include the iron compounds in his analysis. Green describe this as \"disingenuous\".<ref name=\"science\"/> Since a building that contains Prussian blue staining would exhibit much higher levels of detectable cyanides than one without any, Green writes that Leuchter's and Rudolf's measurements reveal nothing more than what is already visible to the naked eye.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/>\n\n====Polish follow-up investigation====\nIn February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, director of The Institute for Forensic Research (IFRC) in Krak\u00f3w conducted a fair experiment where iron compounds were excluded.<ref name=science/> Given that the ruins of the gas chambers at Birkenau have been washed by a column of water at least 35m in height based on climatological records since 1945,<ref name=\"IFRC\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/introduction.html|title=Cracow (Post-Leuchter) Report|last=Markiewicz|first=Jan|date=|work=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz & Birkenau Concentration Camps|publisher=Institute of Forensic Research|location=Cracow|access-date=|via=|author2=Gubala, Wojciech|author3=Labedz, Jerzy|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref>{{rp|Introduction}} Markiewicz and his team were not optimistic at being able to detect cyanides so many years later; nevertheless, having the legal permission to obtain samples, they collected some from areas as sheltered from the elements as possible.<ref name=ironblues/>\n\nLeuchter's report stated that the small amounts of cyanide he detected in the ruins of the crematoria are merely the result of [[fumigation]]. However the IFRC points out that the control samples they took from living areas which may have been fumigated only once as part of the 1942 typhus epidemic tested negative for cyanide, and that the typhus epidemic occurred before the crematoria at Birkenau even existed.<ref name=IFRC/>{{rp|Final Remarks}}\n\n[[File:Ruin of the gas chamber of Crematorium II.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Crematorium II gas chamber at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].]]\nAccordingly, the IFRC demonstrated that cyanides were present in all of the facilities where it is claimed that they were exposed, i.e. all five crematoria, the cellars of [[Block 11]] and the delousing facilities.<ref name=ironblues/> Critics state that any attempt to demonstrate that the crematoria could not have functioned as homicidal gas chambers on the basis that they were not exposed to cyanide is unsuccessful, given that its presence in what remains of these facilities is incontrovertible,<ref name=chemistry/> and write that all of the gas chambers were exposed to cyanide at levels higher than background levels elsewhere in the camp, such as living areas, where no cyanides at all were detected.<ref name=ironblues/> In addition, tests conducted at Auschwitz in 1945 revealed the presence of cyanides on ventilation grilles found in the ruins of Crematorium II (thus also demonstrating that the Leuchter report was not the first forensic examination of the camp as purported in the title of the London edition).<ref name=chemistry/> The historian [[Richard J. Evans]] argued that due to Leuchter's ignorance of the large disparity between the amounts of cyanide necessary to kill humans and lice, instead of disproving the homicidal use of gas chambers, the small amounts of cyanide which Leuchter detected actually tended to confirm it.<ref name=confirm>Evans, Richard J.

Leuchter]], who was commissioned by [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]] to defend him at his trial in Canada for distributing [[Holocaust denial]] material. Leuchter compiled the report in 1988 with the intention of investigating the feasibility of mass homicidal [[gas chamber|gassings]] at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, specifically at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. He travelled to the camp, collected multiple pieces of brick from the remains of the crematoria and gas chambers (without the camp's permission), brought them back to the United States, and submitted them for chemical analysis. At the trial, Leuchter was called upon to defend the report in the capacity of an expert witness; however during the trial, the court ruled that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such.\n\nLeuchter cited the absence of [[Prussian blue]] in the homicidal gas chambers to support his view that they could not have been used to gas people. However, residual iron-based [[cyanide]] compounds are not a categorical consequence of cyanide exposure. By not discriminating against that, Leuchter introduced an unreliable factor into his experiment, and his findings were seriously flawed as a result. In contrast, tests conducted by Polish forensic scientists (who discriminated against iron-based compounds) confirmed the presence of cyanide in the locations(source?), in accordance with where and how it was used in [[the Holocaust]]. In addition, the report was criticized as Leuchter had overlooked critical evidence, such as documents in the SS architectural office which recorded the mechanical operation of the gas chambers and others which verified the rate at which the Nazis could burn the bodies of those gassed.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1985, [[Ernst Z\u00fcndel]], a German pamphleteer and publisher living in Canada, was put on trial for publishing [[Richard Verrall (political writer)|Richard Verrall]]'s Holocaust denial pamphlet ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'', which was deemed to violate Canadian laws against distributing false news. Z\u00fcndel was found guilty, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. This led to a second prosecution.\n\nZ\u00fcndel and his lawyers were joined by [[Robert Faurisson]], a French academic of literature and Holocaust denier, who came to Toronto to advise the defence,<ref name=Lipstadt>[[Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt, Deborah]]. ''Denying the Holocaust&mdash;The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory''.

Leuchter, a Bostonian execution equipment designer. Faurisson reported that Leuchter initially accepted the mainstream account of the Holocaust, but after two days of discussion with him, he stated that Leuchter was convinced that homicidal gassings never occurred. After having met Z\u00fcndel in Toronto and agreeing to serve as an expert witness for his defence, Leuchter travelled with them to spend a week in Poland.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|162}} He was accompanied by his draftsman, a cinematographer supplied by Z\u00fcndel, a translator fluent in German and Polish, and his wife. Although Z\u00fcndel and Faurisson did not accompany them, Leuchter said that they were with them \"every step of the way\" in spirit.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|162}}\n\nAfter arriving in Poland the group spent three days at the former [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp site, and another at the former [[Majdanek]] concentration camp. At these, they filmed Leuchter illicitly collecting what he regarded to be forensic quality samples of materials<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|163}}from the wreckage of the former gas extermination facilities,<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|162}} while his wife and the translator acted as lookouts.<ref name=\"transcript\">{{Cite news| url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html| title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=| year=2006 | first=Errol | last=Morris | accessdate = 2008-05-17}}</ref> Drawings of where the samples were taken from, the film footage of their physical collection and Leuchter's notebook detailing the work were surrendered to the trial court as evidence.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> Leuchter claimed that his conclusions were based on his expert knowledge of gas chamber operation, his visual inspection of what remained of the structures at Auschwitz, and original drawings and blueprints of some of the facilities.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|163}} He said that the blueprints had been given to him by Auschwitz Museum officials.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|163}}\n\n==Report==\nThe compiled report was published in Canada as ''The Leuchter Report: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek, Poland'', by Z\u00fcndel's Samisdat Publications, and in England as ''Auschwitz: The End of the Line. The Leuchter Report: The First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz'' by Focal Point Publications, David Irving's publishing house.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|163}} However, the court accepted the report only as evidentiary display and not as direct evidence; Leuchter was therefore required to explain it and testify to its veracity in the trial.<ref name=\"transcript\"/>\n\nBefore Leuchter could do this, he was examined by the court. He admitted that he was not a toxicologist and dismissed the need for having a degree in engineering:\n\n{{Quote|text=THE COURT: How do you function as an engineer if you don't have an engineering degree?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Well, I would question, Your Honour, what an engineering degree is. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and I have the required background training both on the college level and in the field to perform my function as an engineer.\n\nTHE COURT: Who determines that? You?\n\n|sign=Exchange between Leuchter and Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Z\u00fcndel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 8973.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|164}}}}\n\nLeuchter admitted under oath that he only had a bachelor of arts degree and implicitly suggested that an engineering degree was unavailable to him by saying that his college did not offer an engineering degree during his studies. [[Boston University]] actually offered three different kinds of such qualification when he was a student there.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|165}} When asked by the court if the B.A. he obtained was in a field that entitled him to operate as an engineer, he confirmed that this was so, even though his degree was in history.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|165}} Similarly, Leuchter claimed that he obtained most of his research material on the camps (including original crematoria blueprints) from the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps' archives, and testified that these documents had a far more important role in shaping his conclusions than the physical samples he collected, yet after the trial the director of the Auschwitz museum denied that Leuchter had received any plans or blueprints from them.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|165}}\n\nJudge Ronald Thomas began to label Leuchter's methodology as \"ridiculous\" and \"preposterous\", dismissing many of the report's conclusions on the basis that they were based on \"second-hand information\", and refused to allow him to testify on the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on humans because he had never worked with the substance, and was neither a toxicologist nor a chemist.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|166}} Judge Thomas dismissed Leuchter's opinion because it was of \"no greater value than that of an ordinary tourist\", and in regards to Leuchter's opinion said:\n\n{{Quote|text=His opinion on this report is that there were never any gassings or there was never any exterminations carried on in this facility.

DuPont, the largest American manufacturer of hydrogen cyanide, stated that it had \"never provided any information on cyanides to persons representing themselves as Holocaust deniers, including Fred Leuchter\", and had \"never provided any information regarding the use of cyanide at Auschwitz, Birkenau or Majdanek.\"<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|166}}\n\n==Claims and criticism==\nThe contents of the report, in particular Leuchter's methodology, are heavily criticised. James Roth, the manager of the lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, swore under oath to the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometres, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analysing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.<ref name=\"transcript\"/>\n\n===Prussian blue===\nLeuchter's opposition to the possibility of homicidal gassings at Auschwitz relies on residual cyanide remains found in the homicidal gas chambers and delousing chambers at Auschwitz.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|167}} While both facilities were exposed to the same substance ([[Zyklon B]]), many of the delousing chambers are stained with an iron based compound known as Prussian blue, which is not apparent in the homicidal gas chambers.<ref name=\"ironblues\">{{Cite news|url=http://phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/blue/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Leuchter, Rudolf, and the Iron Blues|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> It is not only this disparity that Leuchter cites, but accordingly from his samples (which included measurements of it) that he claims he measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the gas chambers, which he argues is inconsistent between the amounts necessary to kill human beings and lice.<ref name=Lipstadt/>{{rp|167}} This argument is often cited by Holocaust deniers, and similar claims are also made by [[Germar Rudolf]].\n\nAccording to [[Richard J. Green]]:\n\n{{Quote|text=In order for Leuchter or Rudolf to demonstrate the significance of their findings, it is necessary for them to prove the necessity of Prussian blue formation under the conditions that the homicidal gas chambers were operated. Showing that the delousing chambers have Prussian blue and that the homicidal gas chambers do not, proves nothing, if it cannot be shown that conditions in the gas chambers were such as to produce Prussian blue.<ref name=ironblues/>}}\n\nIn other words, Green states that Leuchter failed to show that Prussian Blue would have been produced in the homicidal gas chambers in the first place\u2014meaning its absence is not in itself proof that no homicidal gassings took place.<ref name=\"chemistry\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=The Chemistry of Auschwitz|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Majdanek Komora Gazowa.JPG|thumbnail|Gas chamber in [[Majdanek concentration camp]] with blue residue]]\nThe problem with Prussian blue is that it is by no means a categorical sign of cyanide exposure.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/> One factor necessary in its formation is a very high concentration of cyanide.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/> In terms of the difference between amounts measured in the delousing chambers and homicidal gas chambers, critics explain that the exact opposite of what deniers claim is true. Insects have a far higher resistance to cyanide than humans, with concentration levels up to 16,000ppm (parts per million) and an exposure time of more than 20 hours<ref name=\"chemistry\"/> (sometimes as long as 72 hours) being necessary for them to succumb. In contrast, a cyanide concentration of only 300ppm is fatal to humans in a matter of minutes.<ref name=\"science\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Chemistry is Not the Science: Rudolf, Rhetoric, and Reduction|accessdate=2008-05-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604152626/http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|archivedate=2008-06-04}}</ref> This difference is one of the reasons behind the concentration disparity. Another exceedingly sensitive factor by which very small deviances could determine whether Prussian blue may form is [[pH]]. pH could be affected by the presence of human beings.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/> Also, while the delousing chambers were left intact, the ruins of the crematoria at Birkenau had been exposed to the elements for over forty years by the time Leuchter collected his samples. This would have severely affected his results, because unlike Prussian blue and other iron based cyanides, cyanide salts are highly soluble in water.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/>\n\nSince the formation of Prussian blue is not an unconditional outcome of exposure to cyanide, it is not a reliable indicator. Leuchter and Rudolf claim to have measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the homicidal gas chambers, but since they did not discriminate against an unreliable factor, Green maintains that instant bias is introduced into their experiments.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/> Similarly, Rudolf acknowledges that Prussian blue does not always form upon exposure to cyanide and is thus not a reliable marker, yet continues to include the iron compounds in his analysis. Green describe this as \"disingenuous\".<ref name=\"science\"/> Since a building that contains Prussian blue staining would exhibit much higher levels of detectable cyanides than one without any, Green writes that Leuchter's and Rudolf's measurements reveal nothing more than what is already visible to the naked eye.<ref name=\"ironblues\"/>\n\n====Polish follow-up investigation====\nIn February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, director of The Institute for Forensic Research (IFRC) in Krak\u00f3w conducted a fair experiment where iron compounds were excluded.<ref name=science/> Given that the ruins of the gas chambers at Birkenau have been washed by a column of water at least 35m in height based on climatological records since 1945,<ref name=\"IFRC\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/introduction.html|title=Cracow (Post-Leuchter) Report|last=Markiewicz|first=Jan|date=|work=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz & Birkenau Concentration Camps|publisher=Institute of Forensic Research|location=Cracow|access-date=|via=|author2=Gubala, Wojciech|author3=Labedz, Jerzy|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref>{{rp|Introduction}} Markiewicz and his team were not optimistic at being able to detect cyanides so many years later; nevertheless, having the legal permission to obtain samples, they collected some from areas as sheltered from the elements as possible.<ref name=ironblues/>\n\nLeuchter's report stated that the small amounts of cyanide he detected in the ruins of the crematoria are merely the result of [[fumigation]]. However the IFRC points out that the control samples they took from living areas which may have been fumigated only once as part of the 1942 typhus epidemic tested negative for cyanide, and that the typhus epidemic occurred before the crematoria at Birkenau even existed.<ref name=IFRC/>{{rp|Final Remarks}}\n\n[[File:Ruin of the gas chamber of Crematorium II.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Crematorium II gas chamber at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].]]\nAccordingly, the IFRC demonstrated that cyanides were present in all of the facilities where it is claimed that they were exposed, i.e. all five crematoria, the cellars of [[Block 11]] and the delousing facilities.<ref name=ironblues/> Critics state that any attempt to demonstrate that the crematoria could not have functioned as homicidal gas chambers on the basis that they were not exposed to cyanide is unsuccessful, given that its presence in what remains of these facilities is incontrovertible,<ref name=chemistry/> and write that all of the gas chambers were exposed to cyanide at levels higher than background levels elsewhere in the camp, such as living areas, where no cyanides at all were detected.<ref name=ironblues/> In addition, tests conducted at Auschwitz in 1945 revealed the presence of cyanides on ventilation grilles found in the ruins of Crematorium II (thus also demonstrating that the Leuchter report was not the first forensic examination of the camp as purported in the title of the London edition).<ref name=chemistry/> The historian [[Richard J. Evans]] argued that due to Leuchter's ignorance of the large disparity between the amounts of cyanide necessary to kill humans and lice, instead of disproving the homicidal use of gas chambers, the small amounts of cyanide which Leuchter detected actually tended to confirm it.<ref name=confirm>Evans, Richard J.
