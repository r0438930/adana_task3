This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for [[Elizabeth II]], where the title has been redefined as ''Queen of Canada''.<ref name=Swann>{{cite book|last=Swann|first=Conrad|title=Canada Symbols of Sovereignty: An investigation of the arms and seals borne from the earliest times to the present in connection with public authority in and over Canada. along with consideration of some connected flags|chapter=Chapter I, Arms of dominion and sovereignty and public authority|location=Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press}}</ref> These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.\n\nBy 1957, the arms were redrawn by [[Alan Beddoe]] so as to have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more resembling [[St. Edward's Crown]], as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name=RHSC/> To mark the 1982 [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended the last vestiges of British authority over Canada, a [[McGill University]] student named Bruce Hicks proposed to [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] [[Gerald Regan]] that the motto of the [[Order of Canada]] be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the [[Order of the Garter]], the Scottish [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms]] the [[Order of the Thistle]], and the royalist [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Regime]] the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] and [[Order of Saint Michael]]).<ref name=Hicks>{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Bruce|title=The Campaign to Change the Royal Arms of Canada (Hogtown Heraldry 12:4)}}</ref> While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.<ref name=McCreery>{{cite book|last=McCreery|first=Christopher|title=The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development|isbn=0-8020-3940-5|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}</ref>\n\nIt took until 1994 for the Queen to approve the new design for general use, though the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] began to allow for its limited use beginning in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians.<ref name=hansard/> These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the [[Order of Canada]]\u2014''Desiderantes meliorem patriam''.

This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for [[Elizabeth II]], where the title has been redefined as ''Queen of Canada''.<ref name=Swann>{{cite book|last=Swann|first=Conrad|title=Canada Symbols of Sovereignty: An investigation of the arms and seals borne from the earliest times to the present in connection with public authority in and over Canada. along with consideration of some connected flags|chapter=Chapter I, Arms of dominion and sovereignty and public authority|location=Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press}}</ref> These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.\n\nBy 1957, the arms were redrawn by [[Alan Beddoe]] so as to have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more resembling [[St. Edward's Crown]], as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name=RHSC/> To mark the 1982 [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended the last vestiges of British authority over Canada, a [[McGill University]] student named Bruce Hicks proposed to [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] [[Gerald Regan]] that the motto of the [[Order of Canada]] be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the [[Order of the Garter]], the Scottish [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms]] the [[Order of the Thistle]], and the royalist [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Regime]] the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] and [[Order of Saint Michael]]).<ref name=Hicks>{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Bruce|title=The Campaign to Change the Royal Arms of Canada (Hogtown Heraldry 12:4)}}</ref> While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.<ref name=McCreery>{{cite book|last=McCreery|first=Christopher|title=The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History and Development|isbn=0-8020-3940-5|location=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}</ref>\n\nIt took until 1994 for the Queen to approve the new design for general use, though the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] began to allow for its limited use beginning in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians.<ref name=hansard/> These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the [[Order of Canada]]\u2014''Desiderantes meliorem patriam''.
