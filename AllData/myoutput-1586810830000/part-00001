The Porcupine Mountains were named by the native [[Ojibwa]] people, supposedly because their silhouette had the shape of a crouching [[porcupine]].<ref name=vogel/> They are home to the most extensive stand of [[old growth]] [[northern hardwood]] forest in North America west of the [[Adirondack Mountains]], spanning at least {{convert|31000|acre|ha}}. The area is popular among tourists, especially [[Lake of the Clouds]] in the heart of the mountains, and is part of '''Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park'''.<ref name=mdnr/>  \n\nThe Porcupine Mountains were the site of [[copper]] mining in the 19th century. One of these mines is the [[Nonesuch Mine]], which operated sporadically from 1867 to 1912. Because of its copper mining history, the [[state park]] is a cooperating unit of [[Keweenaw National Historical Park]].\n\n==Geology==\nThe most striking geological feature of the Porcupine Mountains is the long [[basalt]] and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] [[escarpment]] parallel to the Lake Superior shore and overlooking Lake of the Clouds, a continuation of the same copper-bearing bedrock found farther northeast on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]].<ref name=mdnr2/> A second ridge farther inland, on the other side of Lake of the Clouds, includes Summit Peak, the highest point in the mountains at 1,958 feet (595 m).<ref name=summit/> Rivers, waterfalls, swamps, and lakes lie between the rocky outcroppings. There are a number of waterfalls on the [[Presque Isle River]] in the extreme western side of the park.\n\n==Meteorology==\nThe mountains are subject to heavy [[lake-effect snow]] from [[Lake Superior]]. The relatively high elevation of the mountains and their proximity to the lake provide perfect conditions for lake-effect snow, but no official records are maintained anywhere in the mountains. The closest National Weather Service station is in the coastal community of Ontonagon, where the annual average is about {{convert|200|in|cm}}. Totals of well over {{convert|250|in|cm}} annually are likely in the higher elevations. It is not uncommon to have {{convert|300|in|cm|adj=on}} seasons in this region.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nThe Porkies are the location of a large stand of [[old growth forest]]. In these virgin forests, [[sugar maple]], [[American basswood]], [[eastern hemlock]], and [[yellow birch]] are the most abundant tree species.<ref name=\"OldGrowthEastUS\"/> \n\nArea fauna includes [[moose]], [[gray wolves]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[coyotes]], [[gray fox|gray]] and [[red fox]]es, [[cougar]], river [[otters]], [[beaver]], [[fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[marten]], [[mink]], [[bobcats]], [[lynx]], [[American black bear|black bears]], and [[porcupines]]. There have been numerous bear sightings. \n\nEndangered, threatened and special concern species found in the Porkies include small blue-eyed mary, ram's head ladyslipper, Hooker's fairy-bells, slender cliff brake, male fern, gray wolf, wood turtle, peregrine falcon, merlin, and bald eagle.<ref name=mdnr2/> \n\n==State park==\nPorcupine Mountains State Park was established in 1945 to protect the area's large stand of old-growth forest, much of it of the \"maple-hemlock\" type. In 1972, Michigan passed the Wilderness and Natural Areas Act. This act gave the park the new designation of the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park. Facilities provided by the park include an extensive network of backcountry trails for hiking and wilderness backpacking, rustic trailside cabins, modern campgrounds, swimming and boating areas, and various interpretive programs led by [[park ranger]]s. The [[North Country Trail]] passes through the park, making up a portion of the {{convert|87|mi|km}} of hiking trails. A ski area operates within the park in winter.<ref name=mdnr/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=mdnr>{{cite web |url=http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=426&type=SPRK |title=Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park |publisher=Michigan Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=mdnr2>{{cite web |url=https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79133_79200_31427-54024--,00.html |title=Porcupine Mountains |series=Natural Areas |publisher=Michigan Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=mdnr3>{{cite web |url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/dnr/DatesEstablished_650313_7.pdf |title=When were Michigan state parks and recreation areas established?
