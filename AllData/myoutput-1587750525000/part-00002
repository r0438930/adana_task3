Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and many other cartoon characters.\n\n''Looney Tunes''{{'}} name was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s musical series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''. They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros. Studio biography|publisher=AnimationUSA.com|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Looney Tunes'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]], struggling rapist, and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Several ''Looney Tunes'' films are considered among the greatest animated cartoons of all time (e.g. ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''; All three ''Merrie Melodies''), and five (three ''Merrie Melodies'': ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'' and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''; and two ''Looney Tunes'': ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn the inception, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]]. In 1996, ''[[Space Jam]]'', a feature film mixing animation and live-action, was released to theaters starring Bugs Bunny and basketball player [[Michael Jordan]]. Despite a mixed critical reception,<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/ \"Movie Reviews: Space Jam\".] Retrieved on January 23, 2008.</ref> the film was a major box-office success, grossing nearly $100&nbsp;million in the U.S. alone, almost becoming the first non-Disney animated film to achieve that feat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spacejam.htm|title=Space Jam (1996)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> For a two-year period, it was the highest grossing non-Disney animated film ever.<ref name=\"JerryBeck\">{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2005|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]}}</ref> The film also introduced the character [[Lola Bunny]], who subsequently became another recurring member of the ''Looney Tunes'' cast, usually as a love interest for Bugs.\n\nIn 1997, Bugs Bunny was featured on a U.S. 32 cent postage stamp; the first of five ''Looney Tunes'' themed stamps to be issued.<ref>[http://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134746/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/subpage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm |date=June 10, 2010 }} [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' also achieved success in the area of television during this era, with appearances in several originally produced series, including ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (1991, starring Taz) and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995, starring Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny). The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J. Pig]], [[Babs and Buster Bunny]], etc.), plus occasional cameos in the later Warner shows ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (also from Spielberg) and ''[[Histeria!]]''.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nIn 2000, Warner decided to make the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' library exclusive to fellow Time Warner properties, specifically [[Cartoon Network]]. Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

This continued until 2008, when [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6|the final volume of the Golden Collection]] was released.

However, Warner retained the rights to the cartoons and the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' brand names, leaving their former producer Leon Schlesinger to start his own Warner Bros. studio and continue the ''Looney Tunes'' series. With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. Since then, Warner Bros. has owned all rights to all post-1933 characters created by Leon Schlesinger Productions and Warner Bros. Cartoons. The rights to individual cartoons however are in other hands.\n\nIn 1955, Warner Bros. sold the television distribution rights to 191 of its cartoons (which included the black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' and the black-and-white ''Merrie Melodies'' made after Harman and Ising left) to Guild Films.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=2005-09-03|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ/page/n5 6]|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> The copyrights to those cartoons were assigned to [[Sunset Productions]], an entity owned by Warner Bros.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/variety197-1955-02/page/n185/mode/2up|title=Guild Acquires 191 WB Cartoons|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1955-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLNkAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176|title=Hollywood TV: The Studio System in the Fifties}}</ref> The cartoons were distributed by Guild Films until it went bankrupt and was bought by Seven Arts.

Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and many other cartoon characters.\n\n''Looney Tunes''{{'}} name was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s musical series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''. They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.<ref name=\"AniUSA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros. Studio biography|publisher=AnimationUSA.com|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Looney Tunes'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]] and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"Hollywood\">{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Several ''Looney Tunes'' films are considered among the greatest animated cartoons of all time (e.g. ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''; All three ''Merrie Melodies''), and five (three ''Merrie Melodies'': ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'' and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''; and two ''Looney Tunes'': ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn the inception, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was \"[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]\" by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of \"[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]\" by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].\n\n===1930\u20131933: Harman and Ising era===\nIn 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.<ref name=bcdb />\n\n[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]\n\n=== 1933\u20131936 ===\nWhen Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.\n\nNew directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]].\" In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodie'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.\n\n=== 1936\u20131944: More star characters and switch to color ===\nThe debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}</ref>\n\nBugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.\n\n=== 1944\u20131964: Golden Age ===\nMore popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').\n\n=== 1964\u20131969: DePatie\u2013Freleng and Seven Arts era ===\nDuring the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964\u20131967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967\u20131969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.\n\nThe original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).<ref name=bcdb />\n\n=== 1970\u20131999 ===\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans, Mexicans, Jews, Native Americans, Asians, and Germans as Nazis), and questionable vices (such as smoking cigarettes, ingesting pills, and drinking alcohol).\n\nTheatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.\n\nIn the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the Gurnee park was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)\u2014particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their \"Dueling Pianos\" sequence.\n\nIn 1988, [[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' until 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]]. In 1996, ''[[Space Jam]]'', a feature film mixing animation and live-action, was released to theaters starring Bugs Bunny and basketball player [[Michael Jordan]]. Despite a mixed critical reception,<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/ \"Movie Reviews: Space Jam\".] Retrieved on January 23, 2008.</ref> the film was a major box-office success, grossing nearly $100&nbsp;million in the U.S. alone, almost becoming the first non-Disney animated film to achieve that feat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spacejam.htm|title=Space Jam (1996)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> For a two-year period, it was the highest grossing non-Disney animated film ever.<ref name=\"JerryBeck\">{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2005|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]}}</ref> The film also introduced the character [[Lola Bunny]], who subsequently became another recurring member of the ''Looney Tunes'' cast, usually as a love interest for Bugs.\n\nIn 1997, Bugs Bunny was featured on a U.S. 32 cent postage stamp; the first of five ''Looney Tunes'' themed stamps to be issued.<ref>[http://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134746/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/subpage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm |date=June 10, 2010 }} [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Looney Tunes'' also achieved success in the area of television during this era, with appearances in several originally produced series, including ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (1991, starring Taz) and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995, starring Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny). The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J. Pig]], [[Babs and Buster Bunny]], etc.), plus occasional cameos in the later Warner shows ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (also from Spielberg) and ''[[Histeria!]]''.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nIn 2000, Warner decided to make the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' library exclusive to fellow Time Warner properties, specifically [[Cartoon Network]]. Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''.

In 2003, Warner Home Video began releasing select shorts on [[DVD]], aimed at collectors, in four-disc sets known as the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]''. This continued until 2008, when [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6|the final volume of the Golden Collection]] was released.

However, Warner retained the rights to the cartoons and the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' brand names, leaving their former producer Leon Schlesinger to start his own Warner Bros. studio and continue the ''Looney Tunes'' series. With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. They proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. Since then, Warner Bros. has owned all rights to all post-1933 characters created by Leon Schlesinger Productions and Warner Bros. Cartoons. The rights to individual cartoons however are in other hands.\n\nIn 1955, Warner Bros. sold the television distribution rights to 191 of its cartoons (which included the black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' and the black-and-white ''Merrie Melodies'' made after Harman and Ising left) to Guild Films.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=2005-09-03|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ/page/n5 6]|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> The copyrights to those cartoons were assigned to [[Sunset Productions]], an entity owned by Warner Bros.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/variety197-1955-02/page/n185/mode/2up|title=Guild Acquires 191 WB Cartoons|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1955-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLNkAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176|title=Hollywood TV: The Studio System in the Fifties}}</ref> The cartoons were distributed by Guild Films until it went bankrupt and was bought by Seven Arts.
