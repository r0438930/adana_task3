The first house he came to he found the conjuror and Willard Chase, together with the rest of the clan. Making an errand, he sat down near the door, leaving it a little ajar. They stood in the yard near the door and were devising plans to find 'Joe Smith's gold Bible.' The conjuror was much animated, though he had traveled sixty miles the previous day and night.\n\n:Presently the woman of the house became uneasy at the exposures they were making and, stepping through a back door, called in a suppressed tone loud enough to be heard by Mr. Smith, \"Sam, Sam, you are cutting your own throat.\"\n\n:At this the conjuror bawled out at the top of his voice, \"I am not afraid of anybody\u2014we will have them plates in spite of Joe Smith or all the devils in hell.\"\n\n===Brigham Young's 'fortune-teller'===\nIt has been suggested that Walters might be the 'fortune-teller' that Brigham Young referred to on multiple occasions in the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/UT/utahmsc1.htm|title=Uncle Dale's Old Mormon Articles: Misc.

He went three times in one summer to get them, \u2014the same summer in which Joseph did get them. Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist priests and deacons sent for him to tell where those plates were, and to get them out of the hill where they were deposited; and he had not returned to his home from the last trip he made for them more than a week or ten days before Joseph got them. Joseph was what we call an ignorant boy, but this fortune teller whose name I do not remember was a man of profound learning. He had put himself in possession of all the learning in the States, \u2014had been to France, Germany, Italy, and through the world, \u2014had been educated for a priest and turned out to be a devil.

The first house he came to he found the conjuror and Willard Chase, together with the rest of the clan. Making an errand, he sat down near the door, leaving it a little ajar. They stood in the yard near the door and were devising plans to find 'Joe Smith's gold Bible.' The conjuror was much animated, though he had traveled sixty miles the previous day and night.\n\n:Presently the woman of the house became uneasy at the exposures they were making and, stepping through a back door, called in a suppressed tone loud enough to be heard by Mr. Smith, \"Sam, Sam, you are cutting your own throat.\"\n\n:At this the conjuror bawled out at the top of his voice, \"I am not afraid of anybody\u2014we will have them plates in spite of Joe Smith or all the devils in hell.\"\n\n===Brigham Young's 'fortune-teller'===\nIt has been suggested that Walters might be the 'fortune-teller' that Brigham Young referred to on multiple occasions in the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/UT/utahmsc1.htm|title=Uncle Dale's Old Mormon Articles: Misc.

Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist priests and deacons sent for him to tell where those plates were, and to get them out of the hill where they were deposited; and he had not returned to his home from the last trip he made for them more than a week or ten days before Joseph got them. Joseph was what we call an ignorant boy, but this fortune teller whose name I do not remember was a man of profound learning. He had put himself in possession of all the learning in the States, \u2014had been to France, Germany, Italy, and through the world, \u2014had been educated for a priest and turned out to be a devil.
