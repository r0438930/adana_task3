He made a voyage of exploration to northwestern Europe in about 325&nbsp;BC, but his account of it, known widely in [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], has not survived and is now known only through the writings of others.\n\nOn this voyage, he circumnavigated and visited a considerable part of modern-day [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].

Presently [[periplus]] is recognized as a genre of navigational literature.

The last link was supplied by Strabo, who said that an emporium on the island of Corbulo in the mouth of the river [[Loire river|Loire]] was associated with the Britain of Pytheas by [[Polybius]].<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4B*.html IV.2.1].</ref> Assuming that Ictis, Mictis and Corbulo are the same, Diodorus appears to have read Timaeus, who must have read Pytheas, whom Polybius also read.\n\n== Circumstances of the voyage ==\n{{further|Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul}}\nPytheas was the first documented Mediterranean mariner to reach the British Isles.\n\nThe start of Pytheas's voyage is unknown. The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] had closed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to all ships from other nations. Some historians, mainly of the late 19th century and before, therefore speculated (without any evidence) that he must have traveled overland to the mouth of the [[Loire]] or the [[Garonne]]. Others believed that, to avoid the Carthaginian blockade, he may have stayed close to land and sailed only at night, or taken advantage of a temporary lapse in the blockade.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Problem of Pytheas' Thule|first=Ian|last=Whitaker|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=77|issue=2|date=December 1981 \u2013 January 1982|pages=148\u2013164|jstor=3296920}}</ref>\n\nAn alternate theory is that by the 4th century BC, the western Greeks, especially the Massaliotes, were on amicable terms with Carthage. In 348&nbsp;BC, Carthage and Rome came to terms over the [[Sicilian Wars]] with a treaty defining their mutual interests. Rome could use Sicilian markets, Carthage could buy and sell goods at Rome, and slaves taken by Carthage from allies of Rome were to be set free. Rome was to stay out of the western Mediterranean, but these terms did not apply to Massalia, which had its own treaty. During the second half of the 4th century BC, the time of Pytheas' voyage, Massaliotes were presumably free to operate as they pleased; there is, at least, no evidence of conflict with Carthage in any of the sources that mention the voyage.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transalpine Gaul: The Emergence of a Roman Province|first=Charles|last=Ebel|location=Leiden|date=1976|isbn=978-90-04-04384-8|pages=9\u201315|publisher=Brill Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe early part of Pytheas' voyage was outlined by statements of [[Eratosthenes]] that Strabo said are false because taken from{{clarify|date=January 2015}} Pytheas.<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3B*.html III.2.11].</ref> Apparently, Pytheas said that tides ended at the \"sacred promontory\" (''Hieron akr\u014dt\u0113rion'', or [[Sagres Point]]), and from there to [[C\u00e1diz|Gades]] is said to be 5&nbsp;days' sail. Strabo complained about this distance, and about Pytheas' portrayal of the exact location of [[Tartessos]]. Mention of these places in a journal of the voyage indicates that Pytheas passed through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] and sailed north along the coast of [[Portugal]].\n\n==Voyage to Britain==\n\n===The \"circumnavigation\"===\n[[File:Ptolemy-british-isles.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A 1490 Italian reconstruction of the map of [[Ptolemy]]. The map is a result of a combination of the lines of roads and of the coasting expeditions during the first century of Roman occupation. One great fault, however, is a lopsided Scotland, which in one hypothesis is the result of Ptolemy using Pytheas' measurements of latitude ([[Pytheas#Pytheas' measurements of latitude|see below.]]).<ref>{{cite journal |first=James J. |last=Tierney |title=Ptolemy's Map of Scotland |journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies |volume=79 |year=1959 |pages=132\u2013148 |doi=10.2307/627926 |jstor=627926}}</ref> Whether Ptolemy would have had Pytheas' real latitudes at that time is a much debated issue.]]\n\nStrabo reported that Pytheas said he \"travelled over the whole of Britain that was accessible\".<ref name=straboII-4-1>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2D*.html Book II.4.1].</ref> The word ''epelthein'', at root \"come upon\", does not imply any specific method, and Pytheas did not elaborate. He did use the word \"whole\" and he stated a ''perimetros'' (\"perimeter\") of more than 40,000&nbsp;[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]. Using Herodotus' standard of {{convert|600|feet|}} for one stadium gives {{convert|4,545|miles}}; however, there is no way to tell which standard foot was in effect. The English foot is an approximation. Strabo wanted to discredit Pytheas on the grounds that 40,000&nbsp;stadia is outrageously high and cannot be real.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gave a similar number:<ref>Book V chapter 21.</ref> 42,500 stadia, about {{convert|4,830|miles}}, and explains that it is the perimeter of a triangle around Britain. The consensus has been that he probably took his information from Pytheas through [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeaus]]. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] gave the ''circuitus'' reported by Pytheas as 4,875&nbsp;[[Mile#Roman mile|Roman miles]].<ref>''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137&layout=&loc=4.30 Book IV Chapter 30 (16.102)].</ref>\n\nThe explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] explained this apparent fantasy of Pytheas as a mistake of Timaeus.<ref name=nansen51>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=51}}.</ref> Strabo and Diodorus Siculus never saw Pytheas' work, says Nansen, but they and others read of him in Timaeus. Pytheas reported only days' sail. Timaeus converted days to stadia at the rate of 1,000 per day, a standard figure of the times. However, Pytheas only sailed 560&nbsp;stadia per day for a total of 23,800, which in Nansen's view is consistent with 700&nbsp;stadia per degree. Nansen later states that Pytheas must have stopped to obtain astronomical data; presumably, the extra time was spent ashore. Using the stadia of Diodorus Siculus, one obtains 42.5&nbsp;days for the time that would be spent in circumnavigating Britain. (It may have been a virtual circumnavigation{{clarify|date=January 2015}}; see under Thule below.)\n\nThe perimeter, according to Nansen based on the 23,800 stadia, was {{convert|2,375|miles}}. This number is in the neighborhood of what a triangular perimeter ought to be, but it cannot be verified against anything Pytheas may have said, nor was Diodorus Siculus very precise about the locations of the legs. The \"perimeter\" is often translated as \"coastline\", but this translation is misleading. The coastline, following all the bays and inlets, is {{convert|12429|km|mi|order=flip}} (see [[Geography of the United Kingdom#Coastline|Geography of the United Kingdom]]). Pytheas could have travelled any perimeter between that number and Diodorus'. [[Polybius]] added that Pytheas said he traversed the whole of Britain on foot,<ref>Book XXXIV chapter 5, which survives as a fragment in ''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2D*.html Book II.4.1].</ref> of which he, Polybius, was skeptical. Despite Strabo's conviction of a lie, the perimeter said to have been given by Pytheas is not evidence of it. The issue of what he did say can never be settled until more fragments of Pytheas literature are found.\n\n===Name and description of the British===\n{{History of the British Isles}}\nThe first known written use of the word Britain was an [[ancient Greek]] [[transliteration]] of the original P-Celtic term. It is believed to have appeared within a [[periplus]] by the geographer and explorer Pytheas of [[Marseille|Massalia]], but no copies of this work survive. The earliest existing records of the word are quotations of the periplus by later authors, such as those within Strabo's ''[[Geographica]]'', Pliny's ''[[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]]'' and Diodorus of Sicily's ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]''.<ref>Book I.4.2\u20134, Book II.3.5, Book III.2.11 and 4.4, Book IV.2.1, Book IV.4.1, Book IV.5.5, Book VII.3.1</ref> According to Strabo, Pytheas referred to Britain as ''Bretannik\u0113'', which is treated a feminine noun.<ref name=LSJBrettanike>{{LSJ|*bretaniko/s|\u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae|ref}}</ref><ref name=Strabo(1.4.2)>Strabo's ''Geography'' Book I.

They are ruled by many kings and princes who live in peace with each other. Their troops fight from chariots, as did the Greeks in the Trojan War.\n\n===The three corners of Britain: Kantion, Belerion and Orkas===\nOpposite Europe in Diodorus is the promontory (''akr\u014dt\u0113rion'') of ''Kantion'' ([[Kent]]), 100 stadia, about {{convert|11|miles}}, from the land, but the text is ambiguous: \"the land\" could be either Britain or the continent. Four days' sail beyond that is another promontory, ''Belerion'', which can only be [[Cornwall]], as Diodorus is describing the triangular perimeter and the third point is ''Orkas'', presumably the main island of the [[Orkney]] Islands.\n\n===The tin trade===\nThe inhabitants of Cornwall were involved in the manufacture of [[tin ingot]]s. They mined the ore, smelt it and then worked it into pieces the shape of knuckle-bones, after which it was transported to the island of [[Ictis]] by wagon, which could be done at low tide. Merchants that purchased it there packed it on horses for 30&nbsp;days to the river [[Rh\u00f4ne]], where it was carried down to the mouth. Diodorus said that the inhabitants of Cornwall were civilized in manner and especially hospitable to strangers because of their dealings with foreign merchants.\n\n==Thule==\nStrabo related, taking his text from Polybius, that \"Pytheas asserts that he explored in person the whole northern region of Europe as far as the ends of the world.\"<ref name=straboII-4-2>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2D*.html II.4.2].</ref> Strabo did not believe it but he explained what Pytheas meant by the ends of the world.<ref name=straboII-5-8>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html II.5.8].</ref> ''Thoul\u0113'', he said (now spelled [[Thule]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] uses ''Tyle''; [[Vergil]] references ''ultima Thule'' in [[Georgic]] I, Line 30, where the ''ultima'' refer to the end of the world<ref>{{harvnb|Burton|1875|p=2}}</ref>) is the most northerly of the British Isles. There the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the Arctic Circle (see below on Arctic Circle). Moreover, said Strabo, none of the other authors mention Thule, a fact which he used to discredit Pytheas, but which to moderns indicates Pytheas was the first explorer to arrive there and tell of it.\n\nThule was described as an island six days' sailing north of Britain, near the frozen sea (''pep\u0113guia thalatta'', \"solidified sea\").<ref name=straboI-4-2>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/1D*.html I.4.2].</ref> [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] added that it had no nights at midsummer when the sun was passing through the sign of the [[Cancer (constellation)|Crab]] (at the summer solstice),<ref name=plinyIV-30/> a reaffirmation that it is on the Arctic Circle. He added that the crossing to Thule started at the island of ''Berrice'', \"the largest of all\", which may be [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] in the outer [[Hebrides]]. If ''Berrice'' was in the outer Hebrides, the crossing would have brought Pytheas to the coast of [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] or [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Norway]], explaining how he managed to miss the [[Skagerrak]]. If this is his route, in all likelihood he did not actually circumnavigate Britain, but returned along the coast of Germany, accounting for his somewhat larger perimeter.\n\nConcerning the location of Thule, a discrepancy in data caused subsequent geographers some problems, and may be responsible for [[Ptolemy]]'s distortion of [[Scotland]]. Strabo reported that [[Eratosthenes]] places Thule at a parallel 11500&nbsp;stadia (1305&nbsp;miles, or 16.4\u00b0) north of the mouth of the [[Borysthenes]].<ref name=straboI-4-2/> The parallel running through that mouth also passes through Celtica and is Pytheas' base line. Using 3700 or 3800 stadia (approximately 420\u2013430&nbsp;miles or 5.3\u00b0\u20135.4\u00b0) north of [[Marseille]] for a base line obtains a latitude of 64.8\u00b0 or 64.9\u00b0 for Thule, well short of the Arctic Circle. It is in fact the latitude of [[Trondheim]], where Pytheas may have reached land.\n\nA statement by [[Geminus of Rhodes]] quotes ''On the Ocean'' as saying:<ref>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=53}}; Geminus, ''Introduction to the Phenomena'', vi.9.</ref>\n<blockquote>\n... the Barbarians showed us the place where the sun goes to rest. For it was the case that in these parts the nights were very short, in some places two, in others three hours long, so that the sun rose again a short time after it had set.\n</blockquote>\n\nNansen claimed that according to this statement, Pytheas was there in person and that the 21- and 22-hour days must be the customary statement of latitude by length of longest day. He calculates the latitudes to be 64\u00b0&nbsp;32\u2032 and 65\u00b0&nbsp;31\u2032, partially confirming Hipparchus' statement of the latitude of Thule. And yet Strabo said:<ref name=straboII-5-8/> <blockquote>\nPytheas of Massalia tells us that Thule&nbsp;... is farthest north, and that there the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the Arctic<ref>Page 54.</ref> Circle.\n</blockquote>\n\nEratosthenes extended the latitudinal distance from Massalia to Celtica to 5000 stadia (7.1\u00b0), placing the base line in [[Normandy]]. The northernmost location cited in Britain at the Firth of Clyde is now northern Scotland. To get this country south of Britain to conform to Strabo's interpretation of Pytheas, [[Ptolemy]] has to rotate Scotland by 90\u00b0.\n\nThe 5000 stadia must be discounted: it crosses the Borysthenes upriver near [[Kiev]] rather than at the mouth.<ref>The mouth was further north than it is today; even so, 48.4\u00b0 is  near [[Dnipro]]. The Greeks must be allowed some inaccuracy for their measurements. In any case damming has changed the river a great deal and a few thousand years has been enough to change the courses of many rivers.</ref> It does place Pytheas on the Arctic Circle, which in Norway is south of the [[Lofoten islands]]. It seems that Eratosthenes altered the base line to pass through the northern extreme of Celtica. Pytheas, as related by Hipparchus, probably cited the place in Celtica where he first made land. If he used the same practice in Norway, Thule is at least somewhere on the entire northwest coast of Norway from [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] to the Lofoten Islands.\n\nThe explorer, [[Richard Francis Burton]], in his study of Thule stated that it had had many definitions over the centuries. Many more authors have written about it than remembered Pytheas. The question of the location of Pytheas' Thule remains. The latitudes given by the ancient authors can be reconciled. The missing datum required to fix the location is longitude: \"Manifestly we cannot rely upon the longitude.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Burton|1875|p=10}}.</ref>\n\nPytheas crossed the waters northward from Berrice, in the north of the British Isles, but whether to starboard, larboard, or straight ahead is not known. From the time of the Roman Empire all the possibilities were suggested repeatedly by each generation of writers: [[Iceland]], [[Shetland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Norway]] and later [[Greenland]]. A manuscript variant of a name in Pliny has abetted the Iceland theory: ''Nerigon'' instead of ''Berrice'', which sounds like Norway. If one sails west from Norway one encounters Iceland. Burton himself espoused this theory.\n\nThe standard texts have ''Berrice'' presently, as well as ''Bergos'' for ''Vergos'' in the same list of islands. The ''Scandiae'' islands are more of a problem, as they could be Scandinavia, but other islands had that name as well. Moreover, [[Procopius]] says (''De Bello Gothico'', Chapter 15) that the earlier name of Scandinavia was Thule and that it was the home of the [[Goths]]. The fact that Pytheas returned from the vicinity of the Baltic favors Procopius's opinion. The fact that Pytheas lived centuries before the colonization of Iceland and Greenland by European agriculturalists makes them less likely candidates, as he stated that Thule was populated and its soil was tilled.\n\nConcerning the people of Thule Strabo says of Pytheas, but grudgingly:<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html IV.5.5].</ref>\n<blockquote>\n... he might possibly seem to have made adequate use of the facts as regards the people who live close to the frozen zone, when he says that,&nbsp;... the people live on millet and other herbs, and on fruits and roots; and where there are grain and honey, the people get their beverage, also, from them. As for the grain, he says,&nbsp;\u2013 since they have no pure sunshine&nbsp;\u2013 they pound it out in large storehouses, after first gathering in the ears thither; for the threshing floors become useless because of this lack of sunshine and because of the rains.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhat he seems to be describing is an agricultural country that used [[barn (building)|barns]] for threshing grain rather than the Mediterranean outside floor of sun-baked mud and manufactures a drink, possibly [[mead]].<ref>Nelson points out that this passage in Strabo contains \"ambiguity\": he could mean either one drink made from grain and honey, in which case it would have to be mead unless one classified it as a combination of mead and beer, or two drinks, mead and beer. Strabo used the singular ''p\u014dma'' for \"beverage\" but the neuter singular does not exclude a type of which there are two specifics. Some mead also is and was made with hops and is strained briefly through grain (see [[mead]]) The issue remains.

As to whether he explored it in person, he said that he explored the entire north in person (see under Thule above). As the periplus was a sort of ship's log, he probably did reach the Vistula.\n\nAccording to ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|The Natural History]]'' by Pliny the Elder:<ref name=pliny37-11/>\n<blockquote>\nPytheas said that the Gutones, a people of Germany, inhabited the shores of an estuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory extending a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day's sail from this territory, is the Isle of Abalus, upon the shores of which, [[amber]] is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being an excretion of the sea in a concrete form; as, also, that the inhabitants use this [[amber]] by way of fuel, and sell it to their neighbours, the Teutones.</blockquote>\n\nThe \"Gutones\" is a simplification of two manuscript variants, ''Guttonibus'' and ''Guionibus'', which would be in the [[nominative case]] ''Guttones'' or ''Guiones'', the [[Goths]] in the main opinion.<ref>{{cite book|first=Winfred P.|last=Lehmann|authorlink=Winfred P.

A number of etymologies have been proposed but none very well accepted. Amber is not actually named. It is termed the ''concreti maris purgamentum'', the \"frozen sea's leavings\" after the springtime melt. Diodorus used ''\u0113lektron'', the Greek word for [[amber]], the object that gave its name to electricity through its ability to acquire a charge. Pliny presented an archaic opinion, as in his time amber was a precious stone brought from the Baltic at great expense, but the Germans, he said, used it for firewood, according to Pytheas.\n\n\"Mentonomon\" is unambiguously stated to be an ''aestuarium'' or \"estuary\" of 6000 stadia, which using the Herodotean standard of {{convert|600|feet}} per stadium is {{convert|681|miles}}. That number happens to be the distance from the mouth of the [[Skagerrak]] to the mouth of the Vistula, but no source says explicitly where the figure was taken. Competing views, however, usually have to reinterpret \"estuary\" to mean something other than an estuary, as the west of the [[Baltic Sea]] is the only body of estuarial water of sufficient length in the region.\n\nEarlier Pliny said that a large island of three days' sail from the Scythian coast called [[Baltia|Balcia]] by [[Xenophon|Xenophon of Lampsacus]] is called Basilia by Pytheas.<ref name=P4.27.13>''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Nat.+4.27.13&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137 IV.27.13] or IV.13.95 in the Loeb edition.</ref> It is generally understood to be the same as Abalus. Based on the amber, the island could have been [[Heligoland]], [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], the shores of [[Bay of Gdansk]], [[Sambia Peninsula|Sambia]] or the [[Curonian Lagoon]], which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern Europe. This is the earliest use of ''Germania''.\n\n==Voyage to the Don==\nPytheas claimed to have explored the entire north; however, he turned back at the mouth of the Vistula, the border with [[Scythia]]. If he had gone on he would have discovered the ancestral [[Balts]]. They occupied the lands to the east of the Vistula. In the west they began with the people living around [[Frisches Haff]], Lithuanian Aismar\u0117s, \"sea of the [[Aesti|Aistians]]\", who in that vicinity became the Baltic Prussians.<ref>{{harvnb|Gimbutas|1967|p=22}}.</ref> On the east [[Herodotus]] called them the ''Neuri'', a name related to Old Prussian ''narus'', \"the deep\", in the sense of water country. Later Lithuanians would be \"the people of the shore\". The Vistula was the traditional limit of Greater Germany. Place names featuring *''ner''- or *''nar''- are wide-ranging over the vast Proto-Baltic homeland, occupying western Russia before the Slavs.<ref>{{harvnb|Gimbutas|1967|p=101}}.</ref>\n\nHerodotus said that the Neuri had Scythian customs, but they were at first not considered Scythian.<ref>Herodotus IV.105.</ref> During the war between the Scythians and the Persian Empire, the Scythians came to dominate the Neuri. Strabo denied that any knowledge of the shores of the eastern Baltic existed. He had heard of the Sauromatai, but had no idea where to place them.<ref>7.2.4.</ref> Herodotus had mentioned these Sauromatai as a distinct people living near the Neuri. [[Pliny the Elder]], however, was much better informed. The island of Baunonia ([[Bornholm]]), he said lies a days' sail off Scythia, where amber is collected.<ref name=P4.27.13/> To him the limit of Germany was the Vistula. In contrast to Strabo, he knew that the Goths live around the Vistula, but these were definitely Germans.\n\nBy the time of Tacitus, the [[Aestii]] have emerged.<ref>''Germania'', 45.</ref> The former Scythia was now entirely Sarmatia. Evidently the Sarmatians conquered westward to the Vistula. The Goths moved to the south. That the Balts lived east of the Vistula from remote prehistoric times is unquestioned. The Baltic languages, however, are only known from the 2nd millennium AD. They are known to have developed in tribal contexts, as they were originally tribal. The first mention of any tribes is in Ptolemy's description of European Sarmatia, where the main Prussian tribes are mentioned for the first time.<ref>III.5.</ref> In Tacitus, only the language of the Aestii is mentioned. Strabo distinguished the [[Venedi]], who were likely [[Slavs]].

By turning back at what he thought was the limit of Germany, he not only missed the Balts, but did not discover that more Germans, the Goths, had moved into the Baltic area.\n\n[[Polybius]] related: \"... on his return thence (from the north), he traversed the whole of the coast of Europe from [[Cadiz|Gades]] to the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]].\"<ref>Polybius XXXIV.5.</ref> Some authors consider this leg a second voyage, as it does not seem likely he would pass by Marseille without refitting and refreshing the crew. It is striking that he encountered the border of Scythia, turned around, and went around Europe counter-clockwise until he came to the southern side of Scythia on the [[Black Sea]]. It is possible to speculate that he may have hoped to circumnavigate Europe, but the sources do not say.

Nevertheless, Pytheas did obtain latitudes, which, according to Strabo, he expressed in proportions of the gn\u014dm\u014dn (\"index\"), or trigonometric [[Trigonometric functions|tangents]] of angles of elevation to celestial bodies. They were measured on the gn\u014dm\u014dn, the vertical leg of a right triangle, and the flat leg of the triangle. The imaginary hypotenuse looked along the line of sight to the celestial body or marked the edge of a shadow cast by the vertical leg on the horizontal leg.\n\nPytheas took the altitude of the Sun at Massalia at noon on the longest day of the year and found that the tangent was the proportion of 120 (the length of the gn\u014dm\u014dn) to 1/5 less than 42 (the length of the shadow).<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E2*.html II.5.41].</ref> Hipparchus, relying on the authority of Pytheas (says Strabo<ref>II.1.12 and again in II.5.8.</ref>), states that the ratio is the same as for [[Byzantium]] and that the two therefore are on the same parallel. Nansen and others prefer to give the [[cotangent]] 209/600,<ref name=nansen46>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=46}}.</ref> which is the inverse of the tangent, but the angle is greater than 45\u00b0 and it is the tangent that Strabo states. His number system did not permit him to express it as a decimal but the tangent is about&nbsp;2.87.\n\nIt is unlikely that any of the geographers could compute the [[arctangent]], or angle of that tangent. Moderns look it up in a table. Hipparchos is said to have had a table of some angles. The altitude, or angle of elevation, is 70\u00b0&nbsp;47\u2032&nbsp;50\u2033<ref name=nansen46/> but that is not the [[latitude]].\n\nAt noon on the longest day the plane of longitude passing through Marseille is exactly on edge to the Sun. If the Earth's axis were not tilted toward the Sun, a vertical rod at the [[equator]] would have no shadow. A&nbsp;rod further north would have a north-south shadow, and as an elevation of 90\u00b0 would be a zero latitude, the [[Complementary angles|complement]] of the elevation gives the latitude. The Sun is even higher in the sky due to the tilt. The angle added to the elevation by the tilt is known as the [[Axial tilt#Obliquity|obliquity of the ecliptic]] and at that time was 23\u00b0&nbsp;44\u2032&nbsp;40\u2033.<ref name=nansen46/> The [[complementary angles|complement]] of the elevation less the obliquity is 43\u00b0&nbsp;13\u2032, only 5\u2032 in error from Marseille's latitude, 43\u00b0&nbsp;18\u2032.<ref>Most students of Pytheas presume that his differences from modern calculations represent error due to primitive instrumentation. Rawlins assumes the opposite, that Pytheas observed the sun correctly, but his observatory was a few miles south of west-facing Marseille. Working backward from the discrepancy, he arrives at Maire Island or Cape Croisette, which Pytheas would have selected for better viewing over the south horizon. To date there is no archaeological or other evidence to support the presence of such an observatory; however, the deficit of antiquities does not prove non-existence. {{cite journal|title=Pytheas' Solstice Observation Locates Him|first=Dennis|last=Rawlins | journal=DIO & the Journal for Hysterical Astronomy | volume=16 | date=December 2009 | pages=11\u201317 | url=http://www.dioi.org/vols/wg0.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Latitude by the elevation of the north pole===\nA second method of determining the latitude of the observer measures the angle of elevation of a [[celestial pole]], north in the northern hemisphere. Seen from zero latitude the north pole's elevation is zero; that is, it is a point on the horizon. The [[declination]] of the observer's [[zenith]] also is zero and therefore so is their latitude.\n\nAs the observer's latitude increases (traveling north) so does the declination. The pole rises over the horizon by an angle of the same amount. The elevation at the terrestrial [[North Pole]] is 90\u00b0 (straight up) and the celestial pole has a declination of the same value. The latitude also is 90.<ref>{{cite book|title=The American Practical Navigator: an Epitome of Navigation|first=Nathaniel|last=Bowditch|authorlink=Nathaniel Bowditch|publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency |date=2002 | edition=Bicentennial  |url=http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/NAV_PUBS/APN/Chapt-15.pdf |page=243 |quote=That is, the altitude of the elevated pole is equal to the declination of the zenith, which is equal to the latitude|accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nModerns have [[Polaris]] to mark the approximate location of the North celestial pole, which it does nearly exactly, but this position of Polaris was not available in Pytheas' time, due to changes in the positions of the stars.

He did not know the latitude of the circle in degrees. All he had to go by was the definition of the frigid zone as the latitudes north of the line where the celestial arctic circle was equal to the celestial Tropic of Cancer, the ''tropikos kuklos'' (refer to the next subsection). Strabo's angular report of this line as being at 24\u00b0 may well be based on a tangent known to Pytheas, but he did not say that. In whatever mathematical form Pytheas knew the location, he could only have determined when he was there by taking periodic readings of the elevation of the pole (''eksarma tou polou'' in Strabo and others).{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\nToday the elevation can be obtained easily on ship with a [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. Electronic navigational systems have made even this simple measure unnecessary. Longitude was beyond Pytheas and his peers, but it was not of as great a consequence, because ships seldom strayed out of sight of land. East-west distance was a matter of contention to the geographers; they are one of Strabo's most frequent topics. Because of the [[Gnomon|gn\u014dm\u014dn]] north-south distances were accurate often to within a degree.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\nIt is unlikely that any gn\u014dm\u014dn could be read accurately on the pitching deck of a small vessel at night. Pytheas must have made frequent overnight stops to use his gn\u014dm\u014dn and talk to the natives, which would have required interpreters, probably acquired along the way. The few fragments that have survived indicate that this material was a significant part of the ''periplus'', possibly kept as the ship's log. There is little hint of native hostility; the Celts and the Germans appear to have helped him, which suggests that the expedition was put forward as purely scientific. In any case all voyages required stops for food, water and repairs; the treatment of voyagers fell under the special \"guest\" ethic for visitors.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Location of the Arctic Circle===\nThe ancient Greek view of the heavenly bodies on which their navigation was based was imported from [[Babylonia]] by the [[Ionia|Ionian Greeks]], who used it to become a seafaring nation of merchants and colonists during the [[Archaic period in Greece]]. Massalia was an Ionian colony. The first Ionian philosopher, [[Thales]], was known for his ability to measure the distance of a ship at sea from a cliff by the very method Pytheas used to determine the latitude of Massalia, the trigonometric ratios.\n\nThe astronomic model on which ancient Greek navigation was based, which is still in place today, was already extant in the time of Pytheas, the concept of the degrees only being missing. The model<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html II.5.3].</ref> divided the universe into a celestial and an earthly sphere pierced by the same poles. Each of the spheres were divided into zones (''zonai'') by circles (''kukloi'') in planes at right angles to the poles. The zones of the [[celestial sphere]] repeated on a larger scale those of the terrestrial sphere.\n\nThe basis for division into zones was the two distinct paths of the heavenly bodies: that of the stars and that of the Sun and Moon. Astronomers know today that the Earth revolving around the Sun is tilted on its axis, bringing each hemisphere now closer to the Sun, now further away. The Greeks had the opposite model, that the stars and the Sun rotated around the Earth. The stars moved in fixed circles around the poles. The Sun moved at an oblique angle to the circles, which obliquity brought it now to the north, now to the south. The circle of the Sun was the [[ecliptic]]. It was the center of a band called the [[zodiac]] on which various constellations were located.\n\nThe shadow cast by a vertical rod at noon was the basis for defining zonation. The intersection of the northernmost or southernmost points of the ecliptic defined the axial circles passing through those points as the two tropics (''tropikoi kukloi'', \"circles at the turning points\") later named for the zodiacal constellations found there, [[Tropic of cancer|Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]]. During noon of the [[summer solstice]] (therin\u0113 trop\u0113) rods there cast no shadow.<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html II.5.7].</ref> The latitudes between the tropics were called the torrid zone (''diakekaumen\u0113'', \"burned up\").\n\nBased on their experience of the Torrid Zone south of [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]], the Greek geographers judged it uninhabitable. Symmetry requires that there be an uninhabitable Frigid Zone (''katepsugmen\u0113'', \"frozen\") to the north and reports from there since the time of [[Homer]] seemed to confirm it. The edge of the Frigid Zone ought to be as far south from the [[North Pole]] in latitude as the Summer Tropic is from the [[Equator]]. Strabo gives it as 24\u00b0, which may be based on a previous tangent of Pytheas, but he does not say. The Arctic Circle would then be at 66\u00b0, accurate to within a degree.<ref>Strabo's extensive presentation of the geographic model including the theory of the Arctic is to be found in [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Book II Chapter 5].</ref>\n\nSeen from the equator the celestial North Pole (''boreios polos'') is a point on the horizon. As the observer moves northward the pole rises and the [[circumpolar stars]] appear, now unblocked by the Earth. At the Tropic of Cancer the radius of the circumpolar stars reaches 24\u00b0. The edge stands on the horizon. The [[constellation]] of ''mikra arktos'' ([[Ursa Minor]], \"little bear\") was entirely contained within the circumpolar region. The latitude was therefore called the ''arktikos kuklos'', \"circle of the bear\". The terrestrial Arctic Circle was regarded as fixed at this latitude. The celestial Arctic Circle was regarded as identical to the circumference of the circumpolar stars and therefore a variable.\n\nWhen the observer is on the terrestrial Arctic Circle and the radius of the circumpolar stars is 66\u00b0 the celestial Arctic Circle is identical to the celestial [[Tropic of Cancer]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=53}}.</ref> That is what Pytheas means when he says that Thule is located at the place where the Arctic Circle is identical to the [[Tropic of Cancer]].<ref name=straboII-5-8/> At that point, on the day of the [[Summer Solstice]], the vertical rod of the [[Gnomon|gn\u014dm\u014dn]] casts a shadow extending in theory to the horizon over 360\u00b0 as the Sun does not set. Under the pole the Arctic Circle is identical to the Equator and the Sun never sets but rises and falls on the horizon. The shadow of the gn\u014dm\u014dn winds perpetually around it.\n\n===Latitude by length of longest day, and by Sun's elevation on shortest day===\nStrabo used the astronomical cubit (''p\u0113chus'', the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the little finger) as a measure of the elevation of the sun. The term \"cubit\" in this context is obscure; it has nothing to do with distance along either a straight line or an arc, does not apply to celestial distances, and has nothing to do with the gn\u014dm\u014dn. [[Hipparchus]] borrowed this term from [[Babylonia]], where it meant 2\u00b0. They in turn took it from ancient [[Sumer]] so long ago that if the connection between cubits and degrees was known in either Babylonia or Ionia it did not survive. Strabo stated degrees in either cubits or as a proportion of a [[great circle]]. The Greeks also used the length of day at the summer solstice as a measure of latitude. It is stated in equinoctial hours (''h\u014drai is\u0113merinai''), one being 1/12 of the time between sunrise and sunset on an [[equinox]].\n\nBased partly on data taken from Pytheas, Hipparchus correlated cubits of the Sun's elevation at noon on the winter solstice, latitudes in hours of a day on the summer solstice, and distances between latitudes in stadia for some locations.<ref>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=52}}.</ref> Pytheas had proved that Marseille and Byzantium were on the same parallel (see above). Hipparchus, through Strabo,<ref>Strabo [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2A1*.html II.1.12,13].</ref> added that Byzantium and the mouth of the Borysthenes, today's [[Dnepr river]], were on the same [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] and were separated by 3700 stadia, 5.3\u00b0 at Strabo's 700&nbsp;stadia per a degree of [[meridian arc]]. As the [[Circle of latitude|parallel]] through the river-mouth also crossed the coast of \"Celtica\", the distance due north from Marseille to Celtica was 3700 stadia, a baseline from which Pytheas seems to have calculated latitude and distance.<ref>However, Srabo [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2A1*.html II.1.18] implied 3800, still attributed to Hipparchus. [[Eratosthenes]] has quite a different view. See under [[Thule]].</ref>\n\nStrabo said that Ierne (written \u1f38\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7, meaning Ireland <ref>[[\u00c9ire#Etymology]]</ref>) is under 5000 stadia (7.1\u00b0) north of this line. These figures place Celtica around the mouth of the [[Loire river]], an emporium for the trading of British tin. The part of Ireland referenced is the vicinity of [[Belfast]]. Pytheas then would either have crossed the [[Bay of Biscay]] from the coast of Spain to the mouth of the Loire, or reached it along the coast, crossed the [[English channel]] from the vicinity of [[Brest, France]] to [[Cornwall]], and traversed the [[Irish Sea]] to reach the [[Orkney]] Islands. A statement of Eratosthenes attributed by Strabo to Pytheas, that the north of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was an easier passage to Celtica than across the Ocean,<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3B*.html Strabo III.2.11].</ref> is somewhat ambiguous: apparently he knew or knew of both routes, but he does not say which he took.\n\nAt noon on the [[winter solstice]] the Sun stands at 9 cubits and the longest day on the [[summer solstice]] is 16 hours at the baseline through Celtica.<ref>Strabo II.1.18. The notes of the Loeb Strabo summarized and explained this information.</ref> At 2500&nbsp;stadia, approximately 283 miles, or 3.6\u00b0, north of Celtica, are a people Hipparchus called Celtic, but whom Strabo thought were the British, a discrepancy he might not have noted if he had known that the British were also Celtic. The location is Cornwall. The Sun stands at 6&nbsp;cubits and the longest day is 17&nbsp;hours. At 9100&nbsp;stadia, approximately 1032&nbsp;miles, north of Marseille, 5400 or 7.7\u00b0 north of Celtica, the elevation is 4&nbsp;cubits and the longest day is 18&nbsp;hours. This location is in the vicinity of the [[Firth of Clyde]].\n\nHere Strabo launched another quibble. Hipparchus, relying on Pytheas, according to Strabo, placed this area south of Britain, but he, Strabo, calculated that it was north of Ireland (Ierne/\u1f38\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7). Pytheas, however, rightly knew what is now [[Scotland]] as part of Britain, land of the [[Picts]], even though north of Ireland/Ierne. North of southern Scotland the longest day is 19 hours. Strabo, based on theory alone, states that Ierne is so cold<ref name=straboII-5-8/> that any lands north of it must be uninhabited. In the hindsight given to moderns Pytheas, in relying on observation in the field, appears more scientific than Strabo, who discounted the findings of others merely because of their strangeness to him. The ultimate cause of his skepticism is simply that he did not believe Scandinavia could exist. This disbelief may also be the cause of alteration of Pytheas' data.\n\n==On the tides==\nPliny reported that \"Pytheas of Massalia informs us, that in Britain the tide rises 80&nbsp;cubits.\"<ref>''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D99 Book II Chapter 99]</ref> The passage does not give enough information to determine which cubit Pliny meant; however, any cubit gives the same general result. If he was reading an early source, the cubit may have been the [[Cubit#Other important cubits|Cyrenaic]] cubit, an early Greek cubit, of 463.1&nbsp;mm, in which case the distance was {{convert|37|m|ft}}. This number far exceeds any modern known tides.

Diels includes two matching fragments of [[Aetius (philosopher)|A\u00ebtius]]' ''Placita'', one from Pseudo-[[Plutarch]] ''Epitome'' Book&nbsp;III Chapter&nbsp;17 often included in ''[[Moralia]]'' and the other from [[Stobaeus]]' ''Extracta'' Book&nbsp;I Chapter&nbsp;38&nbsp;[33].</ref> attribute the flood tides ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9}} ''pl\u0113mmurai'') to the \"filling of the moon\" ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2}} ''pl\u0113r\u014dsis t\u0113s s\u0113l\u0113n\u0113s'') and the ebb tides ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c0\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2}} ''amp\u014dtides'') to the \"lessening\" ({{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} ''mei\u014dsis''). The words are too ambiguous to make an exact determination of Pytheas' meaning, whether diurnal or [[Tide#Range variation: springs and neaps|spring and neap tides]] are meant, or whether full and new moons or the half-cycles in which they occur. Different translators take different views.\n\nThat daily tides should be caused by full moons and new moons is manifestly wrong, which would be a surprising view in a Greek astronomer and mathematician of the times. He could have meant that spring and neap tides were caused by new and full moons, which is partially correct in that spring tides occur at those times. A gravitational theory (objects fall to the center) existed at the time but Pytheas appears to have meant that the phases themselves were the causes (\u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 ''aitiai''). However imperfect or imperfectly related the viewpoint, Pytheas was the first to associate the tides to the [[Moon#Tidal effects|phases of the moon]].\n\n==Literary influence==\nPytheas was a central source of information on the North Sea and the subarctic regions of western Europe to later periods, and possibly the only source. The only ancient authors we know by name who certainly saw Pytheas' original text were [[Dicaearchus]], [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Eratosthenes]], [[Crates of Mallus]], [[Hipparchus]], [[Polybius]], [[Artemidorus Ephesius|Artemidorus]] and [[Posidonius]].<ref>Lionel Pearson, review of Hans Joachim Mette, ''Pytheas von Massalia'' (Berlin: Gruyter) 1952, in ''Classical Philology'' '''49'''.3 (July 1954), pp.&nbsp;212\u2013214.</ref> Notably the list does not include [[Strabo]] or [[Tacitus]], though Strabo discussed him and Tacitus may likely have known about his work. Either of the two could have known him through other writers or have read his work in the original.\n\nStrabo, citing [[Polybius]], accused Pytheas of promulgating a fictitious journey he could never have funded, as he was a private individual (''idi\u014dt\u0113s'') and a poor man (''pen\u0113s'').<ref name=straboII-4-2/> Markham proposes a possible answer to the funding question:<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1893|p=510}}.</ref> seeing that Pytheas was known as a professional geographer and that north Europe was as yet a question mark to Massalian merchants, he suggests that \"the enterprise was a government expedition of which Pytheas was placed in command.\" In another suggestion the merchants of Marseille sent him out to find northern markets. These theories are speculative but perhaps less so than Strabo's contention that Pytheas was a charlatan just because a professional geographer doubted him.<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2C*.html II.3.5].</ref>\n\nStrabo did explain his reasons for doubting Pytheas' veracity. Citing numerous instances of Pytheas apparently being far off the mark on details concerning known regions, he said: \"however, any man who has told such great falsehoods about the known regions would hardly, I imagine, be able to tell the truth about places that are not known to anybody.\"<ref name=straboI-4-3/> As an example he mentioned that Pytheas says [[Kent]] is several days' sail from Celtica when it is visible from Gaul across the channel. If Pytheas had visited the place he should have verified it personally.\n\nThe objection although partially true is itself flawed. Strabo interjected his own view of the location of Celtica, that it was opposite to Britain, end to end.<ref name=straboI-4-3/> Pytheas, however, places it further south, around the mouth of the Loire (see above), from which it might justifiably be several days' sail.<ref>{{cite magazine | first=Thomas H.B. | last=Graham | title=Thule and the Tin Islands | magazine=The Gentleman's Magazine | volume=CCLXXV | date=July\u2013December 1893 | pages=179 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eIIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA191&dq=Thule+and+the+Tin+Islands&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=iCsQSbK7BY3IMuGU-Qw#PPP7,M1}}</ref> The people across from Britain in Caesar's time were the [[Germanic peoples|Germani]] in the north and the [[Belgae]] in the south. Still, some of the Celtic lands were on the channel and were visible from it, which Pytheas should have mentioned but Strabo implies he did not.\n\nStrabo's other objections are similarly flawed or else completely wrong. He simply did not believe the earth was inhabited north of Ierne. Pytheas however could not then answer for himself, or protect his own work from loss or alteration, so most of the questions concerning his voyage remain unresolved, to be worked over by every generation. To some he was a daring adventurer and discoverer;<ref>{{cite book | title=Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece | first=Georg | last=Sarton | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | date=1993 | isbn=978-0-486-27495-9 | location=New York | pages=524\u2013525 |quote=His fate was comparable to that of [[Marco Polo]] in later times; some of the things that they told were so extraordinary, so contrary to common experience, that wise and prudent men could not believe them and concluded they were fables}}</ref> to others, a semi-legendary blunderer or prevaricator.\n\nThe logical outcome of this tendency is the historical novel with Pytheas as the main character and the celebration of Pytheas in poetry beginning as far back as [[Virgil]]. The process continues into modern times; for example, Pytheas is a key theme in [[Charles Olson]]'s ''Maximus Poems''.  Details of Pytheas' voyage also serve as the backdrop for Chapter I of [[Poul Anderson]]'s science fiction novel, ''[[The Boat of a Million Years]]''. The Stone Stories trilogy by [[Mandy Haggith]] (The Walrus Mutterer, 2018; The Amber Seeker, 2019; The Lyre Dancers, 2020) revolve around Pytheas of Massalia's journeys.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Britain (name)]]\n* [[Cruthin]]\n* [[Euthymenes]]\n* [[Mining in Cornwall]]\n* [[Prydain]]\n* [[Scythia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book| ref=harv | first=Richard F.|last=Burton|authorlink=Richard Francis Burton|title=Ultima Thule; or, A Summer in Iceland|publisher=William P.

Most of the ancients, including the first two just mentioned, refer to his work by his name: \"Pytheas says&nbsp;\u2026\" Two late writers give titles: the astronomical author [[Geminus of Rhodes]] mentions {{lang|grc|\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f68\u03ba\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6}} (''ta peri tou Okeanou''), literally \"things about the Ocean\", sometimes translated as \"Description of the Ocean\", \"On the Ocean\" or \"Ocean\"; [[Marcian of Heraclea|Marcianus]], the scholiast on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], mentions {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2}} (''periodos g\u0113s''), a \"trip around the earth\" or [[Periplus|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (''periplous''), \"sail around\"]].{{fact|date=April 2016}}\n\nScholars of the 19th century tended to interpret these titles as the names of distinct works covering separate voyages; for example, Smith's ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' hypothesizes a voyage to Britain and Thule written about in \"Ocean\" and another from [[Cadiz]] to the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], written about in \"Sail Around\".<ref name=smithpyth/> As is common with ancient texts, multiple titles may represent a single source, for example, if a title refers to a section rather than the whole. Presently [[periplus]] is recognized as a genre of navigational literature. Mainstream consensus is that there was only one work, \"on the Ocean\", which was based on a periplus.\n\nDiodorus did not mention Pytheas by name.

The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] had closed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to all ships from other nations. Some historians, mainly of the late 19th century and before, therefore speculated (without any evidence) that he must have traveled overland to the mouth of the [[Loire]] or the [[Garonne]]. Others believed that, to avoid the Carthaginian blockade, he may have stayed close to land and sailed only at night, or taken advantage of a temporary lapse in the blockade.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Problem of Pytheas' Thule|first=Ian|last=Whitaker|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=77|issue=2|date=December 1981 \u2013 January 1982|pages=148\u2013164|jstor=3296920}}</ref>\n\nAn alternate theory is that by the 4th century BC, the western Greeks, especially the Massaliotes, were on amicable terms with Carthage. In 348&nbsp;BC, Carthage and Rome came to terms over the [[Sicilian Wars]] with a treaty defining their mutual interests. Rome could use Sicilian markets, Carthage could buy and sell goods at Rome, and slaves taken by Carthage from allies of Rome were to be set free. Rome was to stay out of the western Mediterranean, but these terms did not apply to Massalia, which had its own treaty. During the second half of the 4th century BC, the time of Pytheas' voyage, Massaliotes were presumably free to operate as they pleased; there is, at least, no evidence of conflict with Carthage in any of the sources that mention the voyage.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transalpine Gaul: The Emergence of a Roman Province|first=Charles|last=Ebel|location=Leiden|date=1976|isbn=978-90-04-04384-8|pages=9\u201315|publisher=Brill Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe early part of Pytheas' voyage was outlined by statements of [[Eratosthenes]] that Strabo said are false because taken from{{clarify|date=January 2015}} Pytheas.<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3B*.html III.2.11].</ref> Apparently, Pytheas said that tides ended at the \"sacred promontory\" (''Hieron akr\u014dt\u0113rion'', or [[Sagres Point]]), and from there to [[C\u00e1diz|Gades]] is said to be 5&nbsp;days' sail. Strabo complained about this distance, and about Pytheas' portrayal of the exact location of [[Tartessos]]. Mention of these places in a journal of the voyage indicates that Pytheas passed through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] and sailed north along the coast of [[Portugal]].\n\n==Voyage to Britain==\n\n===The \"circumnavigation\"===\n[[File:Ptolemy-british-isles.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A 1490 Italian reconstruction of the map of [[Ptolemy]]. The map is a result of a combination of the lines of roads and of the coasting expeditions during the first century of Roman occupation. One great fault, however, is a lopsided Scotland, which in one hypothesis is the result of Ptolemy using Pytheas' measurements of latitude ([[Pytheas#Pytheas' measurements of latitude|see below.]]).<ref>{{cite journal |first=James J. |last=Tierney |title=Ptolemy's Map of Scotland |journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies |volume=79 |year=1959 |pages=132\u2013148 |doi=10.2307/627926 |jstor=627926}}</ref> Whether Ptolemy would have had Pytheas' real latitudes at that time is a much debated issue.]]\n\nStrabo reported that Pytheas said he \"travelled over the whole of Britain that was accessible\".<ref name=straboII-4-1>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2D*.html Book II.4.1].</ref> The word ''epelthein'', at root \"come upon\", does not imply any specific method, and Pytheas did not elaborate. He did use the word \"whole\" and he stated a ''perimetros'' (\"perimeter\") of more than 40,000&nbsp;[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]. Using Herodotus' standard of {{convert|600|feet|}} for one stadium gives {{convert|4,545|miles}}; however, there is no way to tell which standard foot was in effect. The English foot is an approximation. Strabo wanted to discredit Pytheas on the grounds that 40,000&nbsp;stadia is outrageously high and cannot be real.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gave a similar number:<ref>Book V chapter 21.</ref> 42,500 stadia, about {{convert|4,830|miles}}, and explains that it is the perimeter of a triangle around Britain. The consensus has been that he probably took his information from Pytheas through [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeaus]]. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] gave the ''circuitus'' reported by Pytheas as 4,875&nbsp;[[Mile#Roman mile|Roman miles]].<ref>''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137&layout=&loc=4.30 Book IV Chapter 30 (16.102)].</ref>\n\nThe explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] explained this apparent fantasy of Pytheas as a mistake of Timaeus.<ref name=nansen51>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=51}}.</ref> Strabo and Diodorus Siculus never saw Pytheas' work, says Nansen, but they and others read of him in Timaeus. Pytheas reported only days' sail. Timaeus converted days to stadia at the rate of 1,000 per day, a standard figure of the times. However, Pytheas only sailed 560&nbsp;stadia per day for a total of 23,800, which in Nansen's view is consistent with 700&nbsp;stadia per degree. Nansen later states that Pytheas must have stopped to obtain astronomical data; presumably, the extra time was spent ashore. Using the stadia of Diodorus Siculus, one obtains 42.5&nbsp;days for the time that would be spent in circumnavigating Britain. (It may have been a virtual circumnavigation{{clarify|date=January 2015}}; see under Thule below.)\n\nThe perimeter, according to Nansen based on the 23,800 stadia, was {{convert|2,375|miles}}. This number is in the neighborhood of what a triangular perimeter ought to be, but it cannot be verified against anything Pytheas may have said, nor was Diodorus Siculus very precise about the locations of the legs. The \"perimeter\" is often translated as \"coastline\", but this translation is misleading. The coastline, following all the bays and inlets, is {{convert|12429|km|mi|order=flip}} (see [[Geography of the United Kingdom#Coastline|Geography of the United Kingdom]]). Pytheas could have travelled any perimeter between that number and Diodorus'. [[Polybius]] added that Pytheas said he traversed the whole of Britain on foot,<ref>Book XXXIV chapter 5, which survives as a fragment in ''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2D*.html Book II.4.1].</ref> of which he, Polybius, was skeptical. Despite Strabo's conviction of a lie, the perimeter said to have been given by Pytheas is not evidence of it. The issue of what he did say can never be settled until more fragments of Pytheas literature are found.\n\n===Name and description of the British===\n{{History of the British Isles}}\nThe first known written use of the word Britain was an [[ancient Greek]] [[transliteration]] of the original P-Celtic term. It is believed to have appeared within a [[periplus]] by the geographer and explorer Pytheas of [[Marseille|Massalia]], but no copies of this work survive. The earliest existing records of the word are quotations of the periplus by later authors, such as those within Strabo's ''[[Geographica]]'', Pliny's ''[[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]]'' and Diodorus of Sicily's ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]''.<ref>Book I.4.2\u20134, Book II.3.5, Book III.2.11 and 4.4, Book IV.2.1, Book IV.4.1, Book IV.5.5, Book VII.3.1</ref> According to Strabo, Pytheas referred to Britain as ''Bretannik\u0113'', which is treated a feminine noun.<ref name=LSJBrettanike>{{LSJ|*bretaniko/s|\u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae|ref}}</ref><ref name=Strabo(1.4.2)>Strabo's ''Geography'' Book I.

They are ruled by many kings and princes who live in peace with each other. Their troops fight from chariots, as did the Greeks in the Trojan War.\n\n===The three corners of Britain: Kantion, Belerion and Orkas===\nOpposite Europe in Diodorus is the promontory (''akr\u014dt\u0113rion'') of ''Kantion'' ([[Kent]]), 100 stadia, about {{convert|11|miles}}, from the land, but the text is ambiguous: \"the land\" could be either Britain or the continent. Four days' sail beyond that is another promontory, ''Belerion'', which can only be [[Cornwall]], as Diodorus is describing the triangular perimeter and the third point is ''Orkas'', presumably the main island of the [[Orkney]] Islands.\n\n===The tin trade===\nThe inhabitants of Cornwall were involved in the manufacture of [[tin ingot]]s. They mined the ore, smelt it and then worked it into pieces the shape of knuckle-bones, after which it was transported to the island of [[Ictis]] by wagon, which could be done at low tide. Merchants that purchased it there packed it on horses for 30&nbsp;days to the river [[Rh\u00f4ne]], where it was carried down to the mouth. Diodorus said that the inhabitants of Cornwall were civilized in manner and especially hospitable to strangers because of their dealings with foreign merchants.\n\n==Thule==\nStrabo related, taking his text from Polybius, that \"Pytheas asserts that he explored in person the whole northern region of Europe as far as the ends of the world.\"<ref name=straboII-4-2>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2D*.html II.4.2].</ref> Strabo did not believe it but he explained what Pytheas meant by the ends of the world.<ref name=straboII-5-8>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html II.5.8].</ref> ''Thoul\u0113'', he said (now spelled [[Thule]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] uses ''Tyle''; [[Vergil]] references ''ultima Thule'' in [[Georgic]] I, Line 30, where the ''ultima'' refer to the end of the world<ref>{{harvnb|Burton|1875|p=2}}</ref>) is the most northerly of the British Isles. There the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the Arctic Circle (see below on Arctic Circle). Moreover, said Strabo, none of the other authors mention Thule, a fact which he used to discredit Pytheas, but which to moderns indicates Pytheas was the first explorer to arrive there and tell of it.\n\nThule was described as an island six days' sailing north of Britain, near the frozen sea (''pep\u0113guia thalatta'', \"solidified sea\").<ref name=straboI-4-2>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/1D*.html I.4.2].</ref> [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] added that it had no nights at midsummer when the sun was passing through the sign of the [[Cancer (constellation)|Crab]] (at the summer solstice),<ref name=plinyIV-30/> a reaffirmation that it is on the Arctic Circle. He added that the crossing to Thule started at the island of ''Berrice'', \"the largest of all\", which may be [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] in the outer [[Hebrides]]. If ''Berrice'' was in the outer Hebrides, the crossing would have brought Pytheas to the coast of [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] or [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Norway]], explaining how he managed to miss the [[Skagerrak]]. If this is his route, in all likelihood he did not actually circumnavigate Britain, but returned along the coast of Germany, accounting for his somewhat larger perimeter.\n\nConcerning the location of Thule, a discrepancy in data caused subsequent geographers some problems, and may be responsible for [[Ptolemy]]'s distortion of [[Scotland]]. Strabo reported that [[Eratosthenes]] places Thule at a parallel 11500&nbsp;stadia (1305&nbsp;miles, or 16.4\u00b0) north of the mouth of the [[Borysthenes]].<ref name=straboI-4-2/> The parallel running through that mouth also passes through Celtica and is Pytheas' base line. Using 3700 or 3800 stadia (approximately 420\u2013430&nbsp;miles or 5.3\u00b0\u20135.4\u00b0) north of [[Marseille]] for a base line obtains a latitude of 64.8\u00b0 or 64.9\u00b0 for Thule, well short of the Arctic Circle. It is in fact the latitude of [[Trondheim]], where Pytheas may have reached land.\n\nA statement by [[Geminus of Rhodes]] quotes ''On the Ocean'' as saying:<ref>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=53}}; Geminus, ''Introduction to the Phenomena'', vi.9.</ref>\n<blockquote>\n... the Barbarians showed us the place where the sun goes to rest. For it was the case that in these parts the nights were very short, in some places two, in others three hours long, so that the sun rose again a short time after it had set.\n</blockquote>\n\nNansen claimed that according to this statement, Pytheas was there in person and that the 21- and 22-hour days must be the customary statement of latitude by length of longest day. He calculates the latitudes to be 64\u00b0&nbsp;32\u2032 and 65\u00b0&nbsp;31\u2032, partially confirming Hipparchus' statement of the latitude of Thule. And yet Strabo said:<ref name=straboII-5-8/> <blockquote>\nPytheas of Massalia tells us that Thule&nbsp;... is farthest north, and that there the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the Arctic<ref>Page 54.</ref> Circle.\n</blockquote>\n\nEratosthenes extended the latitudinal distance from Massalia to Celtica to 5000 stadia (7.1\u00b0), placing the base line in [[Normandy]]. The northernmost location cited in Britain at the Firth of Clyde is now northern Scotland. To get this country south of Britain to conform to Strabo's interpretation of Pytheas, [[Ptolemy]] has to rotate Scotland by 90\u00b0.\n\nThe 5000 stadia must be discounted: it crosses the Borysthenes upriver near [[Kiev]] rather than at the mouth.<ref>The mouth was further north than it is today; even so, 48.4\u00b0 is  near [[Dnipro]]. The Greeks must be allowed some inaccuracy for their measurements. In any case damming has changed the river a great deal and a few thousand years has been enough to change the courses of many rivers.</ref> It does place Pytheas on the Arctic Circle, which in Norway is south of the [[Lofoten islands]]. It seems that Eratosthenes altered the base line to pass through the northern extreme of Celtica. Pytheas, as related by Hipparchus, probably cited the place in Celtica where he first made land. If he used the same practice in Norway, Thule is at least somewhere on the entire northwest coast of Norway from [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] to the Lofoten Islands.\n\nThe explorer, [[Richard Francis Burton]], in his study of Thule stated that it had had many definitions over the centuries. Many more authors have written about it than remembered Pytheas. The question of the location of Pytheas' Thule remains. The latitudes given by the ancient authors can be reconciled. The missing datum required to fix the location is longitude: \"Manifestly we cannot rely upon the longitude.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Burton|1875|p=10}}.</ref>\n\nPytheas crossed the waters northward from Berrice, in the north of the British Isles, but whether to starboard, larboard, or straight ahead is not known. From the time of the Roman Empire all the possibilities were suggested repeatedly by each generation of writers: [[Iceland]], [[Shetland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Norway]] and later [[Greenland]]. A manuscript variant of a name in Pliny has abetted the Iceland theory: ''Nerigon'' instead of ''Berrice'', which sounds like Norway. If one sails west from Norway one encounters Iceland. Burton himself espoused this theory.\n\nThe standard texts have ''Berrice'' presently, as well as ''Bergos'' for ''Vergos'' in the same list of islands. The ''Scandiae'' islands are more of a problem, as they could be Scandinavia, but other islands had that name as well. Moreover, [[Procopius]] says (''De Bello Gothico'', Chapter 15) that the earlier name of Scandinavia was Thule and that it was the home of the [[Goths]]. The fact that Pytheas returned from the vicinity of the Baltic favors Procopius's opinion. The fact that Pytheas lived centuries before the colonization of Iceland and Greenland by European agriculturalists makes them less likely candidates, as he stated that Thule was populated and its soil was tilled.\n\nConcerning the people of Thule Strabo says of Pytheas, but grudgingly:<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html IV.5.5].</ref>\n<blockquote>\n... he might possibly seem to have made adequate use of the facts as regards the people who live close to the frozen zone, when he says that,&nbsp;... the people live on millet and other herbs, and on fruits and roots; and where there are grain and honey, the people get their beverage, also, from them. As for the grain, he says,&nbsp;\u2013 since they have no pure sunshine&nbsp;\u2013 they pound it out in large storehouses, after first gathering in the ears thither; for the threshing floors become useless because of this lack of sunshine and because of the rains.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhat he seems to be describing is an agricultural country that used [[barn (building)|barns]] for threshing grain rather than the Mediterranean outside floor of sun-baked mud and manufactures a drink, possibly [[mead]].<ref>Nelson points out that this passage in Strabo contains \"ambiguity\": he could mean either one drink made from grain and honey, in which case it would have to be mead unless one classified it as a combination of mead and beer, or two drinks, mead and beer. Strabo used the singular ''p\u014dma'' for \"beverage\" but the neuter singular does not exclude a type of which there are two specifics. Some mead also is and was made with hops and is strained briefly through grain (see [[mead]]) The issue remains.

As to whether he explored it in person, he said that he explored the entire north in person (see under Thule above). As the periplus was a sort of ship's log, he probably did reach the Vistula.\n\nAccording to ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|The Natural History]]'' by Pliny the Elder:<ref name=pliny37-11/>\n<blockquote>\nPytheas said that the Gutones, a people of Germany, inhabited the shores of an estuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory extending a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day's sail from this territory, is the Isle of Abalus, upon the shores of which, [[amber]] is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being an excretion of the sea in a concrete form; as, also, that the inhabitants use this [[amber]] by way of fuel, and sell it to their neighbours, the Teutones.</blockquote>\n\nThe \"Gutones\" is a simplification of two manuscript variants, ''Guttonibus'' and ''Guionibus'', which would be in the [[nominative case]] ''Guttones'' or ''Guiones'', the [[Goths]] in the main opinion.<ref>{{cite book|first=Winfred P.|last=Lehmann|authorlink=Winfred P.

A number of etymologies have been proposed but none very well accepted. Amber is not actually named. It is termed the ''concreti maris purgamentum'', the \"frozen sea's leavings\" after the springtime melt. Diodorus used ''\u0113lektron'', the Greek word for [[amber]], the object that gave its name to electricity through its ability to acquire a charge. Pliny presented an archaic opinion, as in his time amber was a precious stone brought from the Baltic at great expense, but the Germans, he said, used it for firewood, according to Pytheas.\n\n\"Mentonomon\" is unambiguously stated to be an ''aestuarium'' or \"estuary\" of 6000 stadia, which using the Herodotean standard of {{convert|600|feet}} per stadium is {{convert|681|miles}}. That number happens to be the distance from the mouth of the [[Skagerrak]] to the mouth of the Vistula, but no source says explicitly where the figure was taken. Competing views, however, usually have to reinterpret \"estuary\" to mean something other than an estuary, as the west of the [[Baltic Sea]] is the only body of estuarial water of sufficient length in the region.\n\nEarlier Pliny said that a large island of three days' sail from the Scythian coast called [[Baltia|Balcia]] by [[Xenophon|Xenophon of Lampsacus]] is called Basilia by Pytheas.<ref name=P4.27.13>''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Nat.+4.27.13&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137 IV.27.13] or IV.13.95 in the Loeb edition.</ref> It is generally understood to be the same as Abalus. Based on the amber, the island could have been [[Heligoland]], [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], the shores of [[Bay of Gdansk]], [[Sambia Peninsula|Sambia]] or the [[Curonian Lagoon]], which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern Europe. This is the earliest use of ''Germania''.\n\n==Voyage to the Don==\nPytheas claimed to have explored the entire north; however, he turned back at the mouth of the Vistula, the border with [[Scythia]]. If he had gone on he would have discovered the ancestral [[Balts]]. They occupied the lands to the east of the Vistula. In the west they began with the people living around [[Frisches Haff]], Lithuanian Aismar\u0117s, \"sea of the [[Aesti|Aistians]]\", who in that vicinity became the Baltic Prussians.<ref>{{harvnb|Gimbutas|1967|p=22}}.</ref> On the east [[Herodotus]] called them the ''Neuri'', a name related to Old Prussian ''narus'', \"the deep\", in the sense of water country. Later Lithuanians would be \"the people of the shore\". The Vistula was the traditional limit of Greater Germany. Place names featuring *''ner''- or *''nar''- are wide-ranging over the vast Proto-Baltic homeland, occupying western Russia before the Slavs.<ref>{{harvnb|Gimbutas|1967|p=101}}.</ref>\n\nHerodotus said that the Neuri had Scythian customs, but they were at first not considered Scythian.<ref>Herodotus IV.105.</ref> During the war between the Scythians and the Persian Empire, the Scythians came to dominate the Neuri. Strabo denied that any knowledge of the shores of the eastern Baltic existed. He had heard of the Sauromatai, but had no idea where to place them.<ref>7.2.4.</ref> Herodotus had mentioned these Sauromatai as a distinct people living near the Neuri. [[Pliny the Elder]], however, was much better informed. The island of Baunonia ([[Bornholm]]), he said lies a days' sail off Scythia, where amber is collected.<ref name=P4.27.13/> To him the limit of Germany was the Vistula. In contrast to Strabo, he knew that the Goths live around the Vistula, but these were definitely Germans.\n\nBy the time of Tacitus, the [[Aestii]] have emerged.<ref>''Germania'', 45.</ref> The former Scythia was now entirely Sarmatia. Evidently the Sarmatians conquered westward to the Vistula. The Goths moved to the south. That the Balts lived east of the Vistula from remote prehistoric times is unquestioned. The Baltic languages, however, are only known from the 2nd millennium AD. They are known to have developed in tribal contexts, as they were originally tribal. The first mention of any tribes is in Ptolemy's description of European Sarmatia, where the main Prussian tribes are mentioned for the first time.<ref>III.5.</ref> In Tacitus, only the language of the Aestii is mentioned. Strabo distinguished the [[Venedi]], who were likely [[Slavs]]. From these few references, which are the only surviving evidence apart from glottochronology<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/33282694/Glottochronology-and-It-s-Application-to-the-Balto-Slavic-Languages-Part-1 |title=Glottochronology and Its Application to the Balto-Slavic Languages |last=Novotn\u00e1 |first=Petra |accessdate=18 February 2017}}</ref> and place name analysis, it would seem that the Balts of Pytheas' time were well past the Common [[Balto-Slavic]] stage, and likely spoke a number of related dialects. By turning back at what he thought was the limit of Germany, he not only missed the Balts, but did not discover that more Germans, the Goths, had moved into the Baltic area.\n\n[[Polybius]] related: \"... on his return thence (from the north), he traversed the whole of the coast of Europe from [[Cadiz|Gades]] to the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]].\"<ref>Polybius XXXIV.5.</ref> Some authors consider this leg a second voyage, as it does not seem likely he would pass by Marseille without refitting and refreshing the crew. It is striking that he encountered the border of Scythia, turned around, and went around Europe counter-clockwise until he came to the southern side of Scythia on the [[Black Sea]]. It is possible to speculate that he may have hoped to circumnavigate Europe, but the sources do not say. In other, even more speculative interpretations, Pytheas returned north and the Tanais is not the Don but is a northern river, such as the [[Elbe river]].<ref name=smithpyth>{{harvnb|Smith|1880|loc=Pytheas}}.</ref>\n\n==Measurements of latitude==\n\n===Latitude by the altitude of the Sun===\nIn discussing the work of Pytheas, Strabo typically used direct discourse: \"Pytheas says&nbsp;...\" In presenting his astronomical observations, he changed to indirect discourse: \"[[Hipparchus]] said that Pytheas says&nbsp;...\" either because he never read Pytheas' manuscript (because it was not available to him) or in deference to Hipparchus, who appears to have been the first to apply the Babylonian system of representing the sphere of the Earth by 360\u00b0.<ref>{{cite book|title=Surveying Instruments of Greece and Rome|first=Michael Jonathan Taunton|last=Lewis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2001|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=9780521792974|pages=26\u201327}}</ref>\n\nStrabo used the degrees, based on Hipparchus.<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E2*.html II.5.34]: \"If, then, we cut the greatest circle of the Earth into three hundred and sixty sections, each of these sections will have seven hundred stadia.\"</ref> Neither say that Pytheas did. Nevertheless, Pytheas did obtain latitudes, which, according to Strabo, he expressed in proportions of the gn\u014dm\u014dn (\"index\"), or trigonometric [[Trigonometric functions|tangents]] of angles of elevation to celestial bodies. They were measured on the gn\u014dm\u014dn, the vertical leg of a right triangle, and the flat leg of the triangle. The imaginary hypotenuse looked along the line of sight to the celestial body or marked the edge of a shadow cast by the vertical leg on the horizontal leg.\n\nPytheas took the altitude of the Sun at Massalia at noon on the longest day of the year and found that the tangent was the proportion of 120 (the length of the gn\u014dm\u014dn) to 1/5 less than 42 (the length of the shadow).<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E2*.html II.5.41].</ref> Hipparchus, relying on the authority of Pytheas (says Strabo<ref>II.1.12 and again in II.5.8.</ref>), states that the ratio is the same as for [[Byzantium]] and that the two therefore are on the same parallel. Nansen and others prefer to give the [[cotangent]] 209/600,<ref name=nansen46>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=46}}.</ref> which is the inverse of the tangent, but the angle is greater than 45\u00b0 and it is the tangent that Strabo states. His number system did not permit him to express it as a decimal but the tangent is about&nbsp;2.87.\n\nIt is unlikely that any of the geographers could compute the [[arctangent]], or angle of that tangent. Moderns look it up in a table. Hipparchos is said to have had a table of some angles. The altitude, or angle of elevation, is 70\u00b0&nbsp;47\u2032&nbsp;50\u2033<ref name=nansen46/> but that is not the [[latitude]].\n\nAt noon on the longest day the plane of longitude passing through Marseille is exactly on edge to the Sun. If the Earth's axis were not tilted toward the Sun, a vertical rod at the [[equator]] would have no shadow. A&nbsp;rod further north would have a north-south shadow, and as an elevation of 90\u00b0 would be a zero latitude, the [[Complementary angles|complement]] of the elevation gives the latitude. The Sun is even higher in the sky due to the tilt. The angle added to the elevation by the tilt is known as the [[Axial tilt#Obliquity|obliquity of the ecliptic]] and at that time was 23\u00b0&nbsp;44\u2032&nbsp;40\u2033.<ref name=nansen46/> The [[complementary angles|complement]] of the elevation less the obliquity is 43\u00b0&nbsp;13\u2032, only 5\u2032 in error from Marseille's latitude, 43\u00b0&nbsp;18\u2032.<ref>Most students of Pytheas presume that his differences from modern calculations represent error due to primitive instrumentation. Rawlins assumes the opposite, that Pytheas observed the sun correctly, but his observatory was a few miles south of west-facing Marseille. Working backward from the discrepancy, he arrives at Maire Island or Cape Croisette, which Pytheas would have selected for better viewing over the south horizon. To date there is no archaeological or other evidence to support the presence of such an observatory; however, the deficit of antiquities does not prove non-existence. {{cite journal|title=Pytheas' Solstice Observation Locates Him|first=Dennis|last=Rawlins | journal=DIO & the Journal for Hysterical Astronomy | volume=16 | date=December 2009 | pages=11\u201317 | url=http://www.dioi.org/vols/wg0.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Latitude by the elevation of the north pole===\nA second method of determining the latitude of the observer measures the angle of elevation of a [[celestial pole]], north in the northern hemisphere. Seen from zero latitude the north pole's elevation is zero; that is, it is a point on the horizon. The [[declination]] of the observer's [[zenith]] also is zero and therefore so is their latitude.\n\nAs the observer's latitude increases (traveling north) so does the declination. The pole rises over the horizon by an angle of the same amount. The elevation at the terrestrial [[North Pole]] is 90\u00b0 (straight up) and the celestial pole has a declination of the same value. The latitude also is 90.<ref>{{cite book|title=The American Practical Navigator: an Epitome of Navigation|first=Nathaniel|last=Bowditch|authorlink=Nathaniel Bowditch|publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency |date=2002 | edition=Bicentennial  |url=http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/NAV_PUBS/APN/Chapt-15.pdf |page=243 |quote=That is, the altitude of the elevated pole is equal to the declination of the zenith, which is equal to the latitude|accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nModerns have [[Polaris]] to mark the approximate location of the North celestial pole, which it does nearly exactly, but this position of Polaris was not available in Pytheas' time, due to changes in the positions of the stars. Pytheas reported that the pole was an empty space at the corner of a quadrangle, the other three sides of which were marked by stars.<ref>The report survives in the ''Commentary on the Phainomena of Aratos and Eudoxos'', 1.4.1, fragments of which are preserved in [[Hipparchos]].</ref> Their identity has not survived but based on calculations these are believed to have been \u03b1 and \u03ba in [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] and \u03b2 in [[Ursa Minor]].<ref>{{cite web | first=T.E. | last=Rihll| title=Greek and Roman Science and Technology, V3; Specific subjects; Astronomy |url=http://www.swan.ac.uk/grst/Home%20Page%20G&RS&T.htm | publisher=Swansea University| accessdate=7 June 2012 | location=Note 14}}</ref>\n\nPytheas sailed northward with the intent of locating the Arctic Circle and exploring the \"frigid zone\" to the north of it at the extreme of the Earth. He did not know the latitude of the circle in degrees. All he had to go by was the definition of the frigid zone as the latitudes north of the line where the celestial arctic circle was equal to the celestial Tropic of Cancer, the ''tropikos kuklos'' (refer to the next subsection). Strabo's angular report of this line as being at 24\u00b0 may well be based on a tangent known to Pytheas, but he did not say that. In whatever mathematical form Pytheas knew the location, he could only have determined when he was there by taking periodic readings of the elevation of the pole (''eksarma tou polou'' in Strabo and others).{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\nToday the elevation can be obtained easily on ship with a [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]. Electronic navigational systems have made even this simple measure unnecessary. Longitude was beyond Pytheas and his peers, but it was not of as great a consequence, because ships seldom strayed out of sight of land. East-west distance was a matter of contention to the geographers; they are one of Strabo's most frequent topics. Because of the [[Gnomon|gn\u014dm\u014dn]] north-south distances were accurate often to within a degree.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\nIt is unlikely that any gn\u014dm\u014dn could be read accurately on the pitching deck of a small vessel at night. Pytheas must have made frequent overnight stops to use his gn\u014dm\u014dn and talk to the natives, which would have required interpreters, probably acquired along the way. The few fragments that have survived indicate that this material was a significant part of the ''periplus'', possibly kept as the ship's log. There is little hint of native hostility; the Celts and the Germans appear to have helped him, which suggests that the expedition was put forward as purely scientific. In any case all voyages required stops for food, water and repairs; the treatment of voyagers fell under the special \"guest\" ethic for visitors.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Location of the Arctic Circle===\nThe ancient Greek view of the heavenly bodies on which their navigation was based was imported from [[Babylonia]] by the [[Ionia|Ionian Greeks]], who used it to become a seafaring nation of merchants and colonists during the [[Archaic period in Greece]]. Massalia was an Ionian colony. The first Ionian philosopher, [[Thales]], was known for his ability to measure the distance of a ship at sea from a cliff by the very method Pytheas used to determine the latitude of Massalia, the trigonometric ratios.\n\nThe astronomic model on which ancient Greek navigation was based, which is still in place today, was already extant in the time of Pytheas, the concept of the degrees only being missing. The model<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html II.5.3].</ref> divided the universe into a celestial and an earthly sphere pierced by the same poles. Each of the spheres were divided into zones (''zonai'') by circles (''kukloi'') in planes at right angles to the poles. The zones of the [[celestial sphere]] repeated on a larger scale those of the terrestrial sphere.\n\nThe basis for division into zones was the two distinct paths of the heavenly bodies: that of the stars and that of the Sun and Moon. Astronomers know today that the Earth revolving around the Sun is tilted on its axis, bringing each hemisphere now closer to the Sun, now further away. The Greeks had the opposite model, that the stars and the Sun rotated around the Earth. The stars moved in fixed circles around the poles. The Sun moved at an oblique angle to the circles, which obliquity brought it now to the north, now to the south. The circle of the Sun was the [[ecliptic]]. It was the center of a band called the [[zodiac]] on which various constellations were located.\n\nThe shadow cast by a vertical rod at noon was the basis for defining zonation. The intersection of the northernmost or southernmost points of the ecliptic defined the axial circles passing through those points as the two tropics (''tropikoi kukloi'', \"circles at the turning points\") later named for the zodiacal constellations found there, [[Tropic of cancer|Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]]. During noon of the [[summer solstice]] (therin\u0113 trop\u0113) rods there cast no shadow.<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html II.5.7].</ref> The latitudes between the tropics were called the torrid zone (''diakekaumen\u0113'', \"burned up\").\n\nBased on their experience of the Torrid Zone south of [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]], the Greek geographers judged it uninhabitable. Symmetry requires that there be an uninhabitable Frigid Zone (''katepsugmen\u0113'', \"frozen\") to the north and reports from there since the time of [[Homer]] seemed to confirm it. The edge of the Frigid Zone ought to be as far south from the [[North Pole]] in latitude as the Summer Tropic is from the [[Equator]]. Strabo gives it as 24\u00b0, which may be based on a previous tangent of Pytheas, but he does not say. The Arctic Circle would then be at 66\u00b0, accurate to within a degree.<ref>Strabo's extensive presentation of the geographic model including the theory of the Arctic is to be found in [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Book II Chapter 5].</ref>\n\nSeen from the equator the celestial North Pole (''boreios polos'') is a point on the horizon. As the observer moves northward the pole rises and the [[circumpolar stars]] appear, now unblocked by the Earth. At the Tropic of Cancer the radius of the circumpolar stars reaches 24\u00b0. The edge stands on the horizon. The [[constellation]] of ''mikra arktos'' ([[Ursa Minor]], \"little bear\") was entirely contained within the circumpolar region. The latitude was therefore called the ''arktikos kuklos'', \"circle of the bear\". The terrestrial Arctic Circle was regarded as fixed at this latitude. The celestial Arctic Circle was regarded as identical to the circumference of the circumpolar stars and therefore a variable.\n\nWhen the observer is on the terrestrial Arctic Circle and the radius of the circumpolar stars is 66\u00b0 the celestial Arctic Circle is identical to the celestial [[Tropic of Cancer]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=53}}.</ref> That is what Pytheas means when he says that Thule is located at the place where the Arctic Circle is identical to the [[Tropic of Cancer]].<ref name=straboII-5-8/> At that point, on the day of the [[Summer Solstice]], the vertical rod of the [[Gnomon|gn\u014dm\u014dn]] casts a shadow extending in theory to the horizon over 360\u00b0 as the Sun does not set. Under the pole the Arctic Circle is identical to the Equator and the Sun never sets but rises and falls on the horizon. The shadow of the gn\u014dm\u014dn winds perpetually around it.\n\n===Latitude by length of longest day, and by Sun's elevation on shortest day===\nStrabo used the astronomical cubit (''p\u0113chus'', the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the little finger) as a measure of the elevation of the sun. The term \"cubit\" in this context is obscure; it has nothing to do with distance along either a straight line or an arc, does not apply to celestial distances, and has nothing to do with the gn\u014dm\u014dn. [[Hipparchus]] borrowed this term from [[Babylonia]], where it meant 2\u00b0. They in turn took it from ancient [[Sumer]] so long ago that if the connection between cubits and degrees was known in either Babylonia or Ionia it did not survive. Strabo stated degrees in either cubits or as a proportion of a [[great circle]]. The Greeks also used the length of day at the summer solstice as a measure of latitude. It is stated in equinoctial hours (''h\u014drai is\u0113merinai''), one being 1/12 of the time between sunrise and sunset on an [[equinox]].\n\nBased partly on data taken from Pytheas, Hipparchus correlated cubits of the Sun's elevation at noon on the winter solstice, latitudes in hours of a day on the summer solstice, and distances between latitudes in stadia for some locations.<ref>{{harvnb|Nansen|1911|p=52}}.</ref> Pytheas had proved that Marseille and Byzantium were on the same parallel (see above). Hipparchus, through Strabo,<ref>Strabo [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2A1*.html II.1.12,13].</ref> added that Byzantium and the mouth of the Borysthenes, today's [[Dnepr river]], were on the same [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] and were separated by 3700 stadia, 5.3\u00b0 at Strabo's 700&nbsp;stadia per a degree of [[meridian arc]]. As the [[Circle of latitude|parallel]] through the river-mouth also crossed the coast of \"Celtica\", the distance due north from Marseille to Celtica was 3700 stadia, a baseline from which Pytheas seems to have calculated latitude and distance.<ref>However, Srabo [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2A1*.html II.1.18] implied 3800, still attributed to Hipparchus. [[Eratosthenes]] has quite a different view. See under [[Thule]].</ref>\n\nStrabo said that Ierne (written \u1f38\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7, meaning Ireland <ref>[[\u00c9ire#Etymology]]</ref>) is under 5000 stadia (7.1\u00b0) north of this line. These figures place Celtica around the mouth of the [[Loire river]], an emporium for the trading of British tin. The part of Ireland referenced is the vicinity of [[Belfast]]. Pytheas then would either have crossed the [[Bay of Biscay]] from the coast of Spain to the mouth of the Loire, or reached it along the coast, crossed the [[English channel]] from the vicinity of [[Brest, France]] to [[Cornwall]], and traversed the [[Irish Sea]] to reach the [[Orkney]] Islands. A statement of Eratosthenes attributed by Strabo to Pytheas, that the north of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was an easier passage to Celtica than across the Ocean,<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3B*.html Strabo III.2.11].</ref> is somewhat ambiguous: apparently he knew or knew of both routes, but he does not say which he took.\n\nAt noon on the [[winter solstice]] the Sun stands at 9 cubits and the longest day on the [[summer solstice]] is 16 hours at the baseline through Celtica.<ref>Strabo II.1.18. The notes of the Loeb Strabo summarized and explained this information.</ref> At 2500&nbsp;stadia, approximately 283 miles, or 3.6\u00b0, north of Celtica, are a people Hipparchus called Celtic, but whom Strabo thought were the British, a discrepancy he might not have noted if he had known that the British were also Celtic. The location is Cornwall. The Sun stands at 6&nbsp;cubits and the longest day is 17&nbsp;hours. At 9100&nbsp;stadia, approximately 1032&nbsp;miles, north of Marseille, 5400 or 7.7\u00b0 north of Celtica, the elevation is 4&nbsp;cubits and the longest day is 18&nbsp;hours. This location is in the vicinity of the [[Firth of Clyde]].\n\nHere Strabo launched another quibble. Hipparchus, relying on Pytheas, according to Strabo, placed this area south of Britain, but he, Strabo, calculated that it was north of Ireland (Ierne/\u1f38\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7). Pytheas, however, rightly knew what is now [[Scotland]] as part of Britain, land of the [[Picts]], even though north of Ireland/Ierne. North of southern Scotland the longest day is 19 hours. Strabo, based on theory alone, states that Ierne is so cold<ref name=straboII-5-8/> that any lands north of it must be uninhabited. In the hindsight given to moderns Pytheas, in relying on observation in the field, appears more scientific than Strabo, who discounted the findings of others merely because of their strangeness to him. The ultimate cause of his skepticism is simply that he did not believe Scandinavia could exist. This disbelief may also be the cause of alteration of Pytheas' data.\n\n==On the tides==\nPliny reported that \"Pytheas of Massalia informs us, that in Britain the tide rises 80&nbsp;cubits.\"<ref>''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D99 Book II Chapter 99]</ref> The passage does not give enough information to determine which cubit Pliny meant; however, any cubit gives the same general result. If he was reading an early source, the cubit may have been the [[Cubit#Other important cubits|Cyrenaic]] cubit, an early Greek cubit, of 463.1&nbsp;mm, in which case the distance was {{convert|37|m|ft}}. This number far exceeds any modern known tides. The [[National Oceanography Centre]], which records tides at tidal gauges placed in about 55&nbsp;ports of the UK Tide Gauge Network on an ongoing basis, records the highest mean tidal change between 1987 and 2007 at [[Avonmouth]] in the [[Severn Estuary]] of {{convert|6.955|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web | title=Harmonic Constants | publisher=National Oceanography Centre | date=3 July 2012 | url=http://www.pol.ac.uk/ntslf/constants2.php | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703100723/http://www.pol.ac.uk/ntslf/constants2.php | archivedate=3 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The highest predicted spring [[tide]] between 2008 and 2026 at that location will be {{convert|14.64|m|ft|abbr=on}} on 29&nbsp;September&nbsp;2015.<ref>{{cite web | title=Highest & lowest predicted tides | publisher=National Oceanography Centre | date=3 July 2012 | url=http://www.pol.ac.uk/ntslf/hilo.php?port=avonmouth | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703100710/http://www.pol.ac.uk/ntslf/hilo.php?port=avonmouth | archivedate=3 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Even allowing for geologic and climate change, Pytheas' 80 cubits far exceeds any known tides around Britain.

Diels includes two matching fragments of [[Aetius (philosopher)|A\u00ebtius]]' ''Placita'', one from Pseudo-[[Plutarch]] ''Epitome'' Book&nbsp;III Chapter&nbsp;17 often included in ''[[Moralia]]'' and the other from [[Stobaeus]]' ''Extracta'' Book&nbsp;I Chapter&nbsp;38&nbsp;[33].</ref> attribute the flood tides ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9}} ''pl\u0113mmurai'') to the \"filling of the moon\" ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2}} ''pl\u0113r\u014dsis t\u0113s s\u0113l\u0113n\u0113s'') and the ebb tides ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c0\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2}} ''amp\u014dtides'') to the \"lessening\" ({{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} ''mei\u014dsis''). The words are too ambiguous to make an exact determination of Pytheas' meaning, whether diurnal or [[Tide#Range variation: springs and neaps|spring and neap tides]] are meant, or whether full and new moons or the half-cycles in which they occur. Different translators take different views.\n\nThat daily tides should be caused by full moons and new moons is manifestly wrong, which would be a surprising view in a Greek astronomer and mathematician of the times. He could have meant that spring and neap tides were caused by new and full moons, which is partially correct in that spring tides occur at those times. A gravitational theory (objects fall to the center) existed at the time but Pytheas appears to have meant that the phases themselves were the causes (\u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 ''aitiai''). However imperfect or imperfectly related the viewpoint, Pytheas was the first to associate the tides to the [[Moon#Tidal effects|phases of the moon]].\n\n==Literary influence==\nPytheas was a central source of information on the North Sea and the subarctic regions of western Europe to later periods, and possibly the only source. The only ancient authors we know by name who certainly saw Pytheas' original text were [[Dicaearchus]], [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Eratosthenes]], [[Crates of Mallus]], [[Hipparchus]], [[Polybius]], [[Artemidorus Ephesius|Artemidorus]] and [[Posidonius]].<ref>Lionel Pearson, review of Hans Joachim Mette, ''Pytheas von Massalia'' (Berlin: Gruyter) 1952, in ''Classical Philology'' '''49'''.3 (July 1954), pp.&nbsp;212\u2013214.</ref> Notably the list does not include [[Strabo]] or [[Tacitus]], though Strabo discussed him and Tacitus may likely have known about his work. Either of the two could have known him through other writers or have read his work in the original.\n\nStrabo, citing [[Polybius]], accused Pytheas of promulgating a fictitious journey he could never have funded, as he was a private individual (''idi\u014dt\u0113s'') and a poor man (''pen\u0113s'').<ref name=straboII-4-2/> Markham proposes a possible answer to the funding question:<ref>{{harvnb|Markham|1893|p=510}}.</ref> seeing that Pytheas was known as a professional geographer and that north Europe was as yet a question mark to Massalian merchants, he suggests that \"the enterprise was a government expedition of which Pytheas was placed in command.\" In another suggestion the merchants of Marseille sent him out to find northern markets. These theories are speculative but perhaps less so than Strabo's contention that Pytheas was a charlatan just because a professional geographer doubted him.<ref>''Geographica'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2C*.html II.3.5].</ref>\n\nStrabo did explain his reasons for doubting Pytheas' veracity. Citing numerous instances of Pytheas apparently being far off the mark on details concerning known regions, he said: \"however, any man who has told such great falsehoods about the known regions would hardly, I imagine, be able to tell the truth about places that are not known to anybody.\"<ref name=straboI-4-3/> As an example he mentioned that Pytheas says [[Kent]] is several days' sail from Celtica when it is visible from Gaul across the channel. If Pytheas had visited the place he should have verified it personally.\n\nThe objection although partially true is itself flawed. Strabo interjected his own view of the location of Celtica, that it was opposite to Britain, end to end.<ref name=straboI-4-3/> Pytheas, however, places it further south, around the mouth of the Loire (see above), from which it might justifiably be several days' sail.<ref>{{cite magazine | first=Thomas H.B. | last=Graham | title=Thule and the Tin Islands | magazine=The Gentleman's Magazine | volume=CCLXXV | date=July\u2013December 1893 | pages=179 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eIIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA191&dq=Thule+and+the+Tin+Islands&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=iCsQSbK7BY3IMuGU-Qw#PPP7,M1}}</ref> The people across from Britain in Caesar's time were the [[Germanic peoples|Germani]] in the north and the [[Belgae]] in the south. Still, some of the Celtic lands were on the channel and were visible from it, which Pytheas should have mentioned but Strabo implies he did not.\n\nStrabo's other objections are similarly flawed or else completely wrong. He simply did not believe the earth was inhabited north of Ierne. Pytheas however could not then answer for himself, or protect his own work from loss or alteration, so most of the questions concerning his voyage remain unresolved, to be worked over by every generation. To some he was a daring adventurer and discoverer;<ref>{{cite book | title=Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece | first=Georg | last=Sarton | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | date=1993 | isbn=978-0-486-27495-9 | location=New York | pages=524\u2013525 |quote=His fate was comparable to that of [[Marco Polo]] in later times; some of the things that they told were so extraordinary, so contrary to common experience, that wise and prudent men could not believe them and concluded they were fables}}</ref> to others, a semi-legendary blunderer or prevaricator.\n\nThe logical outcome of this tendency is the historical novel with Pytheas as the main character and the celebration of Pytheas in poetry beginning as far back as [[Virgil]]. The process continues into modern times; for example, Pytheas is a key theme in [[Charles Olson]]'s ''Maximus Poems''.  Details of Pytheas' voyage also serve as the backdrop for Chapter I of [[Poul Anderson]]'s science fiction novel, ''[[The Boat of a Million Years]]''. The Stone Stories trilogy by [[Mandy Haggith]] (The Walrus Mutterer, 2018; The Amber Seeker, 2019; The Lyre Dancers, 2020) revolve around Pytheas of Massalia's journeys.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Britain (name)]]\n* [[Cruthin]]\n* [[Euthymenes]]\n* [[Mining in Cornwall]]\n* [[Prydain]]\n* [[Scythia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book| ref=harv | first=Richard F.|last=Burton|authorlink=Richard Francis Burton|title=Ultima Thule; or, A Summer in Iceland|publisher=William P.
