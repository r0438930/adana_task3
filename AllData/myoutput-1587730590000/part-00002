It was designed by [[John Whitton]] in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and built from 1881 to 1889. It is also known as the '''Bredbo Rail Bridge''' and the '''Bredbo River Railway Viaduct'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1029>{{cite NSW SHR|5011954|Bredbo Rail Bridge Group|hr=01029|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe railway was extended from [[Queanbeyan]] to [[Cooma]] in 1887-89. At that time, the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways, [[John Whitton]], was under government pressure to reduce construction costs. One common method was to build timber bridges, mostly ballast top timber bream bridges. However, for two major waterways, Ingalara Creek ([[Michelago Rail Bridge over Ingalara Creek]] and the [[Bredbo River]], he chose to use Queen post deck trusses, a type of timber truss viaduct that he had already used on the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North line]] between [[Glen Innes, New South Wales|Glen Innes]] and [[Wallangarra, Queensland|Wallangarra]]. Nearer to Cooma, at [[Chakola]], he chose a different type of timber viaduct to cross Umaralla Creek. Several of Whitton's other Queen post deck truss bridges - the Breardy River, Severn River and Bluff River viaducts and the Tenterfield Creek bridge - are also listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Bredbo Rail Bridge is a ten-[[Span (architecture)|span]] timber [[truss]] viaduct. Each span is {{convert|40|ft|m|order=flip}}, centre to centre, of timber trestles.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\nThe Queen deck truss design was copied from one of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s Cornish timber bridges, the [[Cornwall Railway viaducts#St Germans|St Germans viaduct]], which was built about 30 years earlier.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\nThe condition of the bridge was reported as fair as at 4 April 2006 due to lack of maintenance since rail services were suspended.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\nAll these viaducts retain their original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe timber Queen post truss viaduct was an economic bridge for the Queanbeyan to Cooma Railway at a time when the boom years of the 1880s were ending and funding for railway construction was decreasing. The Bredbo viaduct is accessible from the [[Monaro Highway]] and is an impressive timber structure. The Cooma Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro Region]] from the time of its construction 1887-89, and all the timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure. The timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton. The Bredbo viaduct was technically sound and durable, having been built from renowned ironbark hardwood. The two deck Queen post truss timber viaducts on the Cooma Line, together with four on the Main North Line, are a unique class of railway bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\nBredbo Rail Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe timber Queen post truss viaduct was an economic bridge for the Queanbeyan to Cooma Railway at a time when the boom years of the 1880s were ending and funding for railway construction was decreasing.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe viaduct is accessible from the Monaro Highway and is an impressive timber structure.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe Cooma Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the Monaro Region from the time of its construction 1887-89, and the three timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton.
