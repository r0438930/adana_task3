The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=frederick>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> [[Juan Manuel Santos]] of [[Colombia]] has gained attention in terms of the [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|south Americas]].<ref name=jesse/><ref name=laboratory/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known instance of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/> In addition, [[Music|musical]] artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include [[singer-songwriters]] [[David Bowie]],<ref name=bowie/> [[Curtis Mayfield]],<ref name=roots/> and [[Tom Paxton]],<ref name=weissman/> with [[Musical group|bands]] [[The Beatles]],<ref name=beatles/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]],<ref name=queen/> and [[Maze (band)|Maze]] being examples as well.<ref name=maze/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Applications of different terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealistic\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n====Ideals from early history to the Age of Reason====\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms \"ethical\" and \"ideal\" have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of [[United Kingdom|British]] thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|website=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon on the Mount]] constituted an important moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]], Jesus setting forth ideals that later spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=duiker/>]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] example, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the context of the various religious movements of the 1st and 2nd century in the [[Roman Empire]], the ideals of Christian thinking constituted a radical break with the ethical doctrines that had been advocated by those in power. Rejecting views of the upper classes, both during the empire's time and previously in Greco-Roman civilization, the rising Christian community set forth clear-cut principles based on narratives such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which was included in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Specifically, Jesus' exhortations for his followers to \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" as well to \"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\" and practice other idealistic behaviors established a general view emphasizing spiritual standards over material concerns.<ref name=duiker>{{citebook|title=World History, Volume I|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|date=2008|first1=William J.|last1=Duiker|first2=Jackson J.|last2=Spielvogel|pages=148-151|ISBN=9780495569022|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arxyJC05vScC}}</ref>\n\nDespite the degree that Christian viewpoints contradicted Roman traditions, [[early Christianity]] spread throughout the Empire and became a particularly robust force in the empire's society by the 4th century. Reasons for the appeal included not only the idealistic messages but also the similarity between the belief system and previously popular [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cults]]. Finally, emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] made Christianity the official religion of the entire realm.<Ref name=duiker/>\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] widely retained the influences of Jewish and Christian morality over multiple centuries, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers both before and after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many did so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. The course of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" from the 17th to the 19th centuries, being a movement that in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nIn terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for morality through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideals and broader ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith respect to social order, Locke's highly influential writings applied rational principles to governance in support of the doctrine of [[social contract theory]], which permeated Enlightenment discussions about the best form of organizing a country. Locke's works such as the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' set forth an ethical framework in which rational individuals establish a government in order to guarantee their fundamental rights and possess the understanding that they not only can but should alter said government when rational application of the fair-minded \"[[rule of law]]\" has broken down. Thus, Locke labeled fundamental change as a natural consequence of when [[liberty]] no longer receives protection. He criticized competing theories such as the [[divine right of kings]], which the thinker viewed as folly.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn terms of individual thinking on principles, Locke never wrote a single work laying down in depth his conceptual understanding of ethics and morality. However, Lockean thought as described in various writings have emphasized holding to prominent ideals about human behavior in terms of the rational capacity for good, a particular topic of Locke's concern having been the power of education. Locke wrote of its importance within the pages of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. Outlining the best way to rear children in his eyes, Lockean arguments stressed that virtuous actions by adults arose as a direct result of the habits of body and mind taught during youth by forward thinking instructors.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nLocke wrote in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' dividing rational understanding into three inherent areas of scope, the philosopher defining the second as \"practica\" and describing it as,\n{{quote|\"The skill of right applying our own powers and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The most considerable... is ethics, which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and the means to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.\"<ref>John Locke. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Chapter XXI. ''Of the Division of the Sciences''.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Immanuel Kant 3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Thinker [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world,<ref name=frederick/> the philosopher labeling immorality not only wrong on principle but illogical.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\n[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=frederick/>\n\nSumming up Kant's views on ideals in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written,\n{{quote|\"Kant realized that man's rational capacity alone is not sufficient to constitute his dignity and elevate him above the brutes. If reason only enables him to do for himself what instinct does for the animal, then it would indicate for man no higher aim or destiny than that of the brute but only a different way of attaining the same end. However, reason is man's most essential attribute because it is the means by which a truly distinctive dimension is made possible for him. Reason, that is, reflective awareness, makes it possible to distinguish between good and bad, and thus morality can be made the ruling purpose of life. Because man can consider an array of possibilities, and which among them is the most desirable, he can strive to make himself and his world into a realization of his ideals.\"<ref name=anthropology/>}}\n\n====Ideals in post-Enlightenment thought====\n\nBroadly speaking, Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Social equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian values]] previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennials]], and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:TeilhardP 1947.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[Jesuit]] priest and scientist, wrote that moral progress and [[biological evolution]] would converge to unify all in an idealistic existence with [[God]].<ref name=allen/><ref name=langan/><ref name=salem/>]]\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered [[biological evolution]] but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness. Known as the \"Catholic Darwin\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\" or sacred \"Word\".

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case.

Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Idealistic appeals in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, Pericles' \"Funeral Oration\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their [[Public speaking|oratory]] include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances.

In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of the prophet [[Muhammad]] has been held up as a comprehensive ideal for Muslims to study. However, all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path and the larger religious context, according to Islamic scholars. Multiple other prophets exist in Islam and have been considered worth devoted study including [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and previous figures such as [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Moses in Islam|Moses]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the Jewish context, the term \"[[mensch]]\" has gotten frequently used to describe an individual of great worth due to his or her moral actions. Originally coming from [[Yiddish]], the labeling of idealistic people as such has since become co-opted into regular use within the [[English language]] in certain areas.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Different scholarly traditions within [[Judaism]] have articulated theories of promoting moral behavior as well as more generally seeking to improve both humanity and nature in order to meet higher ideals; the process has been known as \"[[tikkun olam]]\", a term often translated to mean \"repairing the world\". In 2013, the surveying analysis group [[Pew Research Center]] polled [[American Jews]] what specific traits were essential to Jewish identity and found that 56% said \"working for justice/equality\".<ref>{{citenews|accessdate=April 10, 2020|url=https://atlantajewishtimes.timesofisrael.com/tikkun-olam-different-strokes-for-different-folks2/|date=September 12, 2018|title=Tikkun Olam: Different Strokes For Different Folks|first=Dave|last=Schechter|periodical=[[The Atlanta Jewish Times]]}}</ref>\n\nChristian thinking has often encouraged regular people to highlight certain individuals as ethical examples. In both [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the traditions of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Saint|saints]] have received veneration due to their heroic deeds. Within [[Protestantism]] and other sects, similar practices have taken place in terms of holding up particular believers for widespread adulation.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:President George W.

No consensus has emerged in any particular area, though much research has been done in the past several decades. Examples of studied categorizations include [[Ageing|age]], [[economic class]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender identity]], [[nationality]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. The general field of [[anthropology]] has studied the evolution of differing societies and come to contradictory conclusions about whether or not certain ideals can be said to be innate to human existence and/or universal in terms of rational advocacy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nEmpirical research has demonstrated differences between [[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]] in terms of their relative approaches to idealistic morality. Specifically, a 2018 report published in the ''International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration'' stated that six scholarly studies published in the past had determined that women value ethical principles at a higher level than men in the context of [[business]] and [[economics]]. However, some of those had found only modest differences. As well, four published reports in the past had failed to detect any significant differences between the sexes.<ref name=poor>{{citejournal|title=Comparative Business Ethics \u2013 Idealism and Relativism in Light of Empirical Researches in Eight CEE Countries, Finland, and Turkey|journal=International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration|volume=4|issue=5|date=July 2018|pages=23-33|doi=10.18775/ijmsba.1849-5664-5419.2014.45.1003|last=Po\u00f3r|first=J\u00f3zsef|last2=Abdulkerim|first2=Yavuzaslan|last3=Ahmet|first3=Bariscil|last4=Koll\u00e1r|first4=P\u00e9ter}}</ref>\n\nThe aforementioned article evaluated distinctions in nationality and determined that significant differences exist between the various peoples when it comes to idealism in the working environment. In depth, the analysis of eight different European nations, constituting of [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Poland]], appeared to the researchers to have illustrated the effects of contrasting social mores. For example, [[Culture of Croatia|Croatian culture]] faced the problem that \"[t]he significant majority of employees are satisfied with the minimum level of ethical behavior\" while the [[Finnish people|Finns]] were labeled as living in a \"traditionally seen... corruption-free or low-corruption and transparent country\".<ref name=poor/> As well, a 2008 report published in the ''Journal of Business Ethics'' concluded that \"levels of idealism... vary across regions of the world in predictable ways\" such that a nation's ethical \"position predicted that country's location on previously documented cultural dimensions, such as individualism and avoidance of uncertainty\".<ref>{{citejournal|title=East Meets West: A Meta-Analytic Investigation of Cultural Variations in Idealism and Relativism|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9667-6|date=2008|volume=83|pages=813\u2013833|first1=Donelson R.|last1=Forsyth|first2=Ernest H.|last2=O'Boyle, Jr.|first3=Michael A.|last3=McDaniel}}</ref>\n\nStudies have additionally evaluated differences based on varying [[Human generation|generations]] in terms of their ethical idealism. In contrast to only finding slight differences in terms of idealism by sex, the aforementioned ''International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration'' study concluded that particular gaps exist between generations; broadly speaking, the older an individual was, the more importance they gave to idealistic ethics according to the analysis.<ref name=poor/>\n\n===Ideals versus absolute or conditional obligations===\n\n[[File:Blood test (1).jpg|thumb|right|Obligated social standards, such as the various [[Social norms|norms]] around the [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|medical professional and patient relationship]], have been argued by thinkers as existing at a different plane than idealistic moral views.<ref name=norbert/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Norbert Paulo]] has stated that, in common life, ideals as such appear to exist in relation to general social obligations. Many of the latter concepts have tended to appear, according to Paulo, absolute and essentially mandatory while also existing in highly particular circumstances. For instance, Paulo has written, [[Physician|physicians]] and [[Nursing|nurses]] face a variety of [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|ethical obligations imposed on them when treating their patients]] that regular individuals encountering said patients randomly do not. He had added that a continuum exists between clear-cut, widely held obligations applied via [[Social norm|social norms]] and vague ones only partially behold to cultural sanction.<ref name=norbert/>\n\nPaulo's argument, thus, has concluded that idealist behavior takes place at a behavioral and mental level above and beyond mere social rules, such actions being \"warranted\" yet \"not strictly required\" either while their optional nature sets them up as being \"praiseworthy\". Ideals represent a method of putting into action an individual's [[personal character]] and its given traits such that, Paulo has argued, moral standards get fleshed out beyond the rigid framework of mere obligations. One person's altruistic caring for another generally has constituted a particular example.<ref name=norbert/>\n\n===Ideals versus virtues===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] has been difficult to access. Ideals have been argued to inherently involve aspirations while virtues function as direct guides for assigned conduct given social standards.<ref name=norbert/> Analysis has run into problems given that both entities are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice. Other philosophers have made the exact opposite argument and seen virtues as fundamentally philosophically weaker entities than ideals.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nGiven the complexity of putting ideals into practice, not to mention resolving conflicts between them, many individuals have chosen to narrowly pick a certain group of them and then harden them into absolute [[dogma]]. Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], the philospher arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref name=anthropology>{{citebook|title=[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|first=Immanuel|last=Kant|date=1996|translator=Victor Lyle Dowdell|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]]|ISBN=9780809320608}}</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n\n[[File:Terry Eagleton in Manchester 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]] has written critically about the practicality of ethical idealism.<ref name=terry/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers. The related issue of to what extent idealistic morality held by individuals reflects broader cultures has done so as well. The extent to which human beings think through their behavior irrationally or rationally has been a major issue in these such discussions.<ref name=kelly/><ref name=terry/>\n\nOne 21st century philosopher who has delved into the topics is [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented critically about the practicality of ethical idealism, Eagleton arguing,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour.

In particular, his book ''As If: Idealization and Ideals'' examined the usefulness of the concepts and the processes through which they've been articulated. Appiah found fault in the general assumptions made by certain thinkers of human rationality and advocated for a larger understanding of the practical nature of the idealization process among scholars of multiple disciplines as well as laypeople.<ref name=kelly/>\n\nIn depth, Appiah's book presented a nuanced picture of ethical idealism in the context of cultural organization, the philosopher writing,\n{{quote|\"The history of our collective moral learning doesn't start with the growing acceptance of a picture of an ideal society.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=frederick>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from.

In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n====Ideals from early history to the Age of Reason====\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms \"ethical\" and \"ideal\" have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of [[United Kingdom|British]] thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|website=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon on the Mount]] constituted an important moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]], Jesus setting forth ideals that later spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=duiker/>]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] example, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the context of the various religious movements of the 1st and 2nd century in the [[Roman Empire]], the ideals of Christian thinking constituted a radical break with the ethical doctrines that had been advocated by those in power. Rejecting views of the upper classes, both during the empire's time and previously in Greco-Roman civilization, the rising Christian community set forth clear-cut principles based on narratives such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which was included in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Specifically, Jesus' exhortations for his followers to \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" as well to \"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\" and practice other idealistic behaviors established a general view emphasizing spiritual standards over material concerns.<ref name=duiker>{{citebook|title=World History, Volume I|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|date=2008|first1=William J.|last1=Duiker|first2=Jackson J.|last2=Spielvogel|pages=148-151|ISBN=9780495569022|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arxyJC05vScC}}</ref>\n\nDespite the degree that Christian viewpoints contradicted Roman traditions, [[early Christianity]] spread throughout the Empire and became a particularly robust force in the empire's society by the 4th century. Reasons for the appeal included not only the idealistic messages but also the similarity between the belief system and previously popular [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cults]]. Finally, emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] made Christianity the official religion of the entire realm.<Ref name=duiker/>\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] widely retained the influences of Jewish and Christian morality over multiple centuries, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers both before and after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many did so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. The course of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" from the 17th to the 19th centuries, being a movement that in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nIn terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for morality through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideals and broader ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith respect to social order, Locke's highly influential writings applied rational principles to governance in support of the doctrine of [[social contract theory]], which permeated Enlightenment discussions about the best form of organizing a country. Locke's works such as the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' set forth an ethical framework in which rational individuals establish a government in order to guarantee their fundamental rights and possess the understanding that they not only can but should alter said government when rational application of the fair-minded \"[[rule of law]]\" has broken down. Thus, Locke labeled fundamental change as a natural consequence of when [[liberty]] no longer receives protection. He criticized competing theories such as the [[divine right of kings]], which the thinker viewed as folly.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn terms of individual thinking on principles, Locke never wrote a single work laying down in depth his conceptual understanding of ethics and morality. However, Lockean thought as described in various writings have emphasized holding to prominent ideals about human behavior in terms of the rational capacity for good, a particular topic of Locke's concern having been the power of education. Locke wrote of its importance within the pages of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. Outlining the best way to rear children in his eyes, Lockean arguments stressed that virtuous actions by adults arose as a direct result of the habits of body and mind taught during youth by forward thinking instructors.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nLocke wrote in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' dividing rational understanding into three inherent areas of scope, the philosopher defining the second as \"practica\" and describing it as,\n{{quote|\"The skill of right applying our own powers and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The most considerable... is ethics, which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and the means to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.\"<ref>John Locke. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Chapter XXI. ''Of the Division of the Sciences''.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Immanuel Kant 3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Thinker [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world,<ref name=frederick/> the philosopher labeling immorality not only wrong on principle but illogical.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\n[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=frederick/>\n\nSumming up Kant's views on ideals in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written,\n{{quote|\"Kant realized that man's rational capacity alone is not sufficient to constitute his dignity and elevate him above the brutes. If reason only enables him to do for himself what instinct does for the animal, then it would indicate for man no higher aim or destiny than that of the brute but only a different way of attaining the same end. However, reason is man's most essential attribute because it is the means by which a truly distinctive dimension is made possible for him. Reason, that is, reflective awareness, makes it possible to distinguish between good and bad, and thus morality can be made the ruling purpose of life. Because man can consider an array of possibilities, and which among them is the most desirable, he can strive to make himself and his world into a realization of his ideals.\"<ref name=anthropology/>}}\n\n====Ideals in post-Enlightenment thought====\n\nBroadly speaking, Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Social equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian values]] previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennials]], and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:TeilhardP 1947.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[Jesuit]] priest and scientist, wrote that moral progress and [[biological evolution]] would converge to unify all in an idealistic existence with [[God]].<ref name=allen/><ref name=langan/><ref name=salem/>]]\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered [[biological evolution]] but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness. Known as the \"Catholic Darwin\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\" or sacred \"Word\".

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judges have also been required to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older.

Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Idealistic appeals in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]].

In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, Pericles' \"Funeral Oration\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their [[Public speaking|oratory]] include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]].

Many of the latter concepts have tended to appear, according to Paulo, absolute and essentially mandatory while also existing in highly particular circumstances. For instance, Paulo has written, [[Physician|physicians]] and [[Nursing|nurses]] face a variety of [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|ethical obligations imposed on them when treating their patients]] that regular individuals encountering said patients randomly do not. He had added that a continuum exists between clear-cut, widely held obligations applied via [[Social norm|social norms]] and vague ones only partially behold to cultural sanction.<ref name=norbert/>\n\nPaulo's argument, thus, has concluded that idealist behavior takes place at a behavioral and mental level above and beyond mere social rules, such actions being \"warranted\" yet \"not strictly required\" either while their optional nature sets them up as being \"praiseworthy\". Ideals represent a method of putting into action an individual's [[personal character]] and its given traits such that, Paulo has argued, moral standards get fleshed out beyond the rigid framework of mere obligations. One person's altruistic caring for another generally has constituted a particular example.<ref name=norbert/>\n\n===Ideals versus virtues===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] has been difficult to access. Ideals have been argued to inherently involve aspirations while virtues function as direct guides for assigned conduct given social standards.<ref name=norbert/> Analysis has run into problems given that both entities are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice. Other philosophers have made the exact opposite argument and seen virtues as fundamentally philosophically weaker entities than ideals.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nGiven the complexity of putting ideals into practice, not to mention resolving conflicts between them, many individuals have chosen to narrowly pick a certain group of them and then harden them into absolute [[dogma]]. Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], the philospher arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref name=anthropology>{{citebook|title=[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|first=Immanuel|last=Kant|date=1996|translator=Victor Lyle Dowdell|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]]|ISBN=9780809320608}}</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n\n[[File:Terry Eagleton in Manchester 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]] has written critically about the practicality of ethical idealism.<ref name=terry/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers.

The extent to which human beings think through their behavior irrationally or rationally has been a major issue in these such discussions.<ref name=kelly/><ref name=terry/>\n\nOne 21st century philosopher who has delved into the topics is [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented critically about the practicality of ethical idealism, Eagleton arguing,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour.

In particular, his book ''As If: Idealization and Ideals'' examined the usefulness of the concepts and the processes through which they've been articulated.
