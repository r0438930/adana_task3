Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants. In Indonesia, lumpia variants usually named after the city where the recipe originates, with [[Semarang]] as the most famous variant. It represents creativity and the localisation of lumpia recipes according to locally available ingredients and local tastes.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|upright|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots. Lumpia Semarang is served either deep-fried or unfried, as the filling is already cooked.<ref name=\"IndoEats-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Jakarta====\nNamed after Indonesian capital city, [[Jakarta]], this lumpia is usually being deep fried and sold as ''gorengan'' fritter snack. Unlike popular Semarang lumpia that uses ''rebung'' or bamboo shoots, Jakarta lumpia uses ''bengkuang'' or jicama, and served with typical Indonesian ''sambal kacang'' or spicy [[peanut sauce]] as a dipping sauce.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Bogor====\nNamed after [[Bogor]], a city in West Java, this lumpia filling is almost similar with Jakarta lumpia; uses jicama, and added with tofu and ''ebi'' dried shrimp. Unlike other regions that are fried, Bogor lumpia are usually grilled on hot iron, giving off a distinctive aroma. In addition, Bogor lumpia is usually shaped rectangle like a pillow and quite large in size.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Bandung====\nNamed after the city of [[Bandung]] in West Java, it is a variant of ''lumpia basah'' or fresh and wet lumpia that is not being deep fried. However, unlike commonn rolled elongated fresh lumpia, lumpia Bandung is not served in [[spring roll]] form, but the lumpia skin is spread, topped with fillings, stacked and folded square just like an envelope. Unlike Semarang style lumpia that uses bamboo shoots and minced chicken, Bandung style lumpia filling uses julienned [[jicama]], [[beansprout]], scallion, garlic, chili, and scrambled egg, with [[palm sugar]] sauce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.viva.co.id/gaya-hidup/kuliner/1119989-resep-lumpia-basah-bandung-kudapan-sehat-bikin-ngiler|title=RESEP: Lumpia Basah Bandung, Kudapan Sehat Bikin Ngiler|last=VIVA|first=PT VIVA MEDIA BARU-|date=2019-02-11|website=www.viva.co.id|language=id|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n====Lumpia Surabaya====\nNamed after the city of [[Surabaya]] in East Java, where this lumpia was originally made.

Yogya typical lumpia usually contain jicama, bean sprouts, carrots, and minced chicken meat; and sometimes stuff like boiled [[quail egg]]s and glass noodles are added as fillings. Yogya lumpia usually served with ''[[acar]]'' pickles, chilies, and toppings made from crushed garlic and jicama. The generous use of garlic and pickles as garnishing was meant to refresh and neutralise the otherwise oily deep fried lumpia.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Medan====\nOriginated from [[Medan]] city of North Sumatra, this lumpia version is more akin to [[popiah]] of neighboring [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], thus in Medan lumpia is more commonly called as popiah. Medan popiah or lumpia is a large fresh unfried spring roll, consumed not as snack, but as main meal. This was because Medan lumpias are made in large sizes with rich fillings, including bamboo shoots, scrambled eggs, peanuts, shrimp, crabs, etc.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia goreng====\n[[File:Lumpia at Teh Jawa, Purwokerto Station, Purwokerto 2015-03-20.jpg|thumb|upright|Smaller size deep fried lumpia served with [[sambal]] hot sauce, sold as a snack in Purwokerto Train Station, Central Java]]\n''Lumpia goreng'' is a simple fried spring rolls filled with vegetables; the spring roll wrappers are filled with chopped carrots cut into matchstick size, shredded cabbage, and sometimes mushrooms.

They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier.

Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants. In Indonesia, lumpia variants usually named after the city where the recipe originates, with [[Semarang]] as the most famous variant. It represents creativity and the localisation of lumpia recipes according to locally available ingredients and local tastes.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|upright|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots. Lumpia Semarang is served either deep-fried or unfried, as the filling is already cooked.<ref name=\"IndoEats-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Jakarta====\nNamed after Indonesian capital city, [[Jakarta]], this lumpia is usually being deep fried and sold as ''gorengan'' fritter snack. Unlike popular Semarang lumpia that uses ''rebung'' or bamboo shoots, Jakarta lumpia uses ''bengkuang'' or jicama, and served with typical Indonesian ''sambal kacang'' or spicy [[peanut sauce]] as a dipping sauce.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Bogor====\nNamed after [[Bogor]], a city in West Java, this lumpia filling is almost similar with Jakarta lumpia; uses jicama, and added with tofu and ''ebi'' dried shrimp. Unlike other regions that are fried, Bogor lumpia are usually grilled on hot iron, giving off a distinctive aroma. In addition, Bogor lumpia is usually shaped rectangle like a pillow and quite large in size.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Bandung====\nNamed after the city of [[Bandung]] in West Java, it is a variant of ''lumpia basah'' or fresh and wet lumpia that is not being deep fried. However, unlike commonn rolled elongated fresh lumpia, lumpia Bandung is not served in [[spring roll]] form, but the lumpia skin is spread, topped with fillings, stacked and folded square just like an envelope. Unlike Semarang style lumpia that uses bamboo shoots and minced chicken, Bandung style lumpia filling uses julienned [[jicama]], [[beansprout]], scallion, garlic, chili, and scrambled egg, with [[palm sugar]] sauce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.viva.co.id/gaya-hidup/kuliner/1119989-resep-lumpia-basah-bandung-kudapan-sehat-bikin-ngiler|title=RESEP: Lumpia Basah Bandung, Kudapan Sehat Bikin Ngiler|last=VIVA|first=PT VIVA MEDIA BARU-|date=2019-02-11|website=www.viva.co.id|language=id|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n====Lumpia Surabaya====\nNamed after the city of [[Surabaya]] in East Java, where this lumpia was originally made.

Yogya typical lumpia usually contain jicama, bean sprouts, carrots, and minced chicken meat; and sometimes stuff like boiled [[quail egg]]s and glass noodles are added as fillings. Yogya lumpia usually served with ''[[acar]]'' pickles, chilies, and toppings made from crushed garlic and jicama. The generous use of garlic and pickles as garnishing was meant to refresh and neutralise the otherwise oily deep fried lumpia.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Medan====\nOriginated from [[Medan]] city of North Sumatra, this lumpia version is more akin to [[popiah]] of neighboring [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], thus in Medan lumpia is more commonly called as popiah. Medan popiah or lumpia is a large fresh unfried spring roll, consumed not as snack, but as main meal. This was because Medan lumpias are made in large sizes with rich fillings, including bamboo shoots, scrambled eggs, peanuts, shrimp, crabs, etc.<ref name=\"Grid-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia goreng====\n[[File:Lumpia at Teh Jawa, Purwokerto Station, Purwokerto 2015-03-20.jpg|thumb|upright|Smaller size deep fried lumpia served with [[sambal]] hot sauce, sold as a snack in Purwokerto Train Station, Central Java]]\n''Lumpia goreng'' is a simple fried spring rolls filled with vegetables; the spring roll wrappers are filled with chopped carrots cut into matchstick size, shredded cabbage, and sometimes mushrooms.

They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref name=\"pablo\">{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Ube turon (Philippines).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[turon (food)|Turon]] halaya'' made with [[Ube halaya|mashed ube]] ([[purple yam]])]]\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.
