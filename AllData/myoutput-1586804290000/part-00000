It lists the 40 most-played songs on [[alternative music|alternative]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations. The chart was introduced as a companion to the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s. During the first several years of the chart, it regularly featured music that did not receive commercial radio airplay anywhere but on a few modern rock and college rock radio stations. This included many [[electronica|electronic]] and [[post-punk]] artists. Gradually, as alternative rock became more \"mainstream\" (particularly spearheaded by the [[grunge]] explosion in the early 1990s), the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock Songs charts began featuring more of the same songs. However, the formats would differentiate themselves by the late 2000s. Today, the Alternative Songs chart favors more [[indie rock]], [[indie pop]], and [[synth-pop]] bands while the Mainstream Rock chart favors more [[alternative rock]], [[hard rock]], and [[heavy metal music]].\n\nThe chart is based solely on radio airplay. As of 2012, approximately 80 radio stations are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite news|url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BX&s_site=sunherald&p_multi=BX&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10C3552E00587870&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|title = The charts|work = [[The Sun Herald]]|date = 2005-08-25|accessdate = 2008-01-18|format = fee required}}</ref> Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \"audience impression\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's [[Arbitron]] listener data.

Several popular songs which were not released as commercial singles did not qualify for the Hot 100 before December 1998, but performed very well on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nIn 1991, with the release of \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\" by Nirvana (which reached No. 1 on November 23, 1991),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/312336/nirvana/chart?f=377|title=Nirvana \u2013 Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> grunge became a new form of alternative rock to chart. However, grunge did not have a dominating presence on the chart in its heyday; over time, grunge would grow into popularity as a representation of alternative rock in the mainstream. Iconic grunge songs fared decently on the Alternative Songs chart but better on the Mainstream Rock Songs.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, \"[[Black (Pearl Jam song)|Black]]\" by [[Pearl Jam]] peaked only at No. 20 on the former but No. 3 on the latter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/328459/pearl-jam/chart?page=2&f=377|title=Pearl Jam \u2013 Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/328459/pearl-jam/chart?page=1&f=376|title=Pearl Jam \u2013 Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> This was because the college rock and new wave of the 1980s remained the dominant styles of the format, while grunge became an alternative rock style that was popular on the Mainstream Rock format.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, alternative rock songs began to crossover to [[Popular music|Pop]] radio, with acts such as [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]] and [[Alanis Morissette]] being played on Pop stations after establishing hits on the Alternative chart.<ref name=\":1\" /> Dominant genres included [[pop punk]] and softer alternative rock, as grunge acts such as [[Soundgarden]] and [[Stone Temple Pilots]] did not reach No. 1, while [[Britpop]], a form of alternative rock from the UK, was represented only by [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].<ref name=\":1\" /> By the late 1990s, the Alternative Songs chart was ruled by relatively lighter alternative rock bands such as [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Matchbox Twenty]] and [[Sugar Ray]] and a plethora of one-hit wonders.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://grantland.com/features/haim-days-gone-indie-rock-death-rattle/|title=Indie Rock\u2019s Tuneful Death Rattle|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=2013-10-01|work=Grantland|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the century, alternative radio embraced [[Nu metal|nu-metal]]/[[rap rock]] with bands including [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]] and most famously, [[Linkin Park]].

(also called '''Alternative''' and formerly known as '''Modern Rock Tracks''' and '''Hot Modern Rock Tracks''') is a [[music chart]] in the United States that has appeared in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] since September 10, 1988.  It lists the 40 most-played songs on [[alternative music|alternative]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations. The chart was introduced as a companion to the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s. During the first several years of the chart, it regularly featured music that did not receive commercial radio airplay anywhere but on a few modern rock and college rock radio stations. This included many [[electronica|electronic]] and [[post-punk]] artists. Gradually, as alternative rock became more \"mainstream\" (particularly spearheaded by the [[grunge]] explosion in the early 1990s), the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock Songs charts began featuring more of the same songs. However, the formats would differentiate themselves by the late 2000s. Today, the Alternative Songs chart favors more [[indie rock]], [[indie pop]], and [[synth-pop]] bands while the Mainstream Rock chart favors more [[alternative rock]], [[hard rock]], and [[heavy metal music]].\n\nThe chart is based solely on radio airplay. As of 2012, approximately 80 radio stations are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite news|url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BX&s_site=sunherald&p_multi=BX&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10C3552E00587870&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|title = The charts|work = [[The Sun Herald]]|date = 2005-08-25|accessdate = 2008-01-18|format = fee required}}</ref> Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \"audience impression\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's [[Arbitron]] listener data.
