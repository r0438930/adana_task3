The first wave of emigration occurred during the military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983, with principally to Spain, USA, Mexico and Venezuela. During the 1990s, due to the abolition of visas between Argentina and the United States, thousands of Argentines emigrated to the North American country. The last major wave of emigration occurred during the 2001 crisis, mainly to Europe, especially Spain, although there was also an increase in emigration to neighboring countries, particularly Brazil,

The most numerous of these communities are the [[Mapuche]]s, who live mostly in the south, the [[Kollas]] and [[Wich\u00ed]]s, from the northwest, and the [[Toba (tribe)|Toba]]s, who live mostly in the northeast.<ref name=ecpi>{{cite web|url=http://www.indec.gov.ar/webcenso/ECPI/index_ecpi.asp|title=INDEC|publisher=|access-date=10 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611004448/http://www.indec.gov.ar/webcenso/ECPI/index_ecpi.asp|archive-date=11 June 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Some [[Mestizo]] population may identify with Native ethnicity.\n\n===Mestizo Argentines===\nWithin the population totals, there may be an imprecise amount of mixed Mestizo population. In one of the most comprehensive genetic studies involving the population of Argentina, 441 Argentines from across the North East, North West, Southern, and Central provinces (especially the urban conglomeration of Buenos Aires) of the country, it was observed that the sample population comprised on average of 65% European, followed by 31% Amerindian, and finally 4% of African ancestry; however, this study was unweighted and meant to be a representation of the diversity of Argentine DNA rather than a demonstration of the average ethnic composition of the country. It was also found there were great differences in the ancestry amongst Argentines as one traveled across the country. A study that attempted to find the average Argentine ancestry by Daniel Corach by weighing the population of various regions gave a significantly higher estimate of European ancestry at 78.5% of the average Argentine's autosomal DNA.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2009.00556.x | volume=74 | title=Inferring Continental Ancestry of Argentineans from Autosomal, Y-Chromosomal and Mitochondrial DNA | journal=Annals of Human Genetics | pages=65\u201376 | pmid=20059473 | date=January 2010 | last1 = Corach | first1 = D | last2 = Lao | first2 = O | last3 = Bobillo | first3 = C | display-authors = etal}}</ref>\n\n===Afro-Argentines===\n{{See also|Afro-Argentine}}\nGenetic studies carried out in 2005 showed that the average level of African genetic contribution in the population of Buenos Aires is 2.2%{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}, but that this component is concentrated in 10% of the population who display notably higher levels of African ancestry.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\nBlacks, Mulattos (mixed Black and European ancestry) and Zambos (mixed Black and Native ancestry) in Argentina might be about 67,000 people{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}; this figure includes 53,000 direct descendants from slaves, plus 12,000\u201315,000 Caboverdian Mulatto immigrants and their descendants{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}, who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s. With constant wars in the 19th century, spread of diseases like the yellow fever, thousands of immigrants from Europe arriving to Argentine soil, and most black women intermarrying with them{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}; noting that their populations were already low, the Afro-Argentine population faded into oblivion.\n\nA new wave of Black immigration started in the 1990s, from African countries (Cape Verde, Nigeria, Senegal, Angola, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Ghana, Sierra Leone, etc.). In recent years Africa Vive, an organization that helps to keep alive Afro-Argentine heritage, calculates that there are between 1 and 2 million Afro-descendants in Argentina.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Asian Argentines===\n{{See also|Asian Argentine}}\nArgentines of Asian ancestry are defined as either born within [[Argentina]], or born elsewhere and later to become a citizen or [[permanent residency|resident]] of Argentina. Asian Argentines settled in Argentina in large numbers during several waves of immigration in the 20th century. Primarily living in their own [[Barrios of Buenos Aires|neighbourhoods]] in Buenos Aires, many currently own their own businesses of varying sizes \u2013 largely textiles, grocery stores, and buffet-style restaurants. The small Asian Argentine population has generally kept a low profile, and is accepted by greater Argentine society.\n\nThe first Argentines of Asian descent were a small group of Japanese immigrants, mainly from the [[Okinawa prefecture]], which came in the period between the early and mid 20th century. In the 1960s, [[Korean people|Koreans]] began to arrive, and in the 1980s, [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] immigrants. The 1990s brought the largest so far wave of Asian immigration to Argentina, from mainland Chinese immigrants, eventually becoming the 4th largest foreigner community in 2013, after Paraguayans, Bolivians, and Peruvians.<ref name=lastdecade />\n\n==Languages==\n{{Main|Languages of Argentina}}\n{{See also|List of indigenous languages in Argentina}}\n\nAlthough Spanish is dominant, being the national language spoken by virtually all Argentines, the spoken languages of Argentina number at least 40. Languages spoken by at least 100,000 Argentines include [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] such as [[Southern Quechua]], [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] and [[Mapudungun]], and immigrant languages such as [[Standard German|German]], Italian, or [[Levantine Arabic]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nTwo native languages are [[extinct languages|extinct]] ([[Abip\u00f3n language|Abip\u00f3n]] and [[Chan\u00e9 language|Chan\u00e9]]), while some others are [[endangered languages|endangered]], spoken by elderly people whose descendants do not speak the languages<ref name=\"LAR\">Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005.

[[Welsh language|Welsh]] is also spoken by over 35,000 people in the [[Chubut Province]]. This includes a dialect called [[Patagonian Welsh]], which has developed since the start of the [[Welsh settlement in Argentina]] in 1865.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Religion in Argentina}}\nA majority of the population of Argentina is [[Christians|Christian]]. According to CONICET survey on creeds, about 76.5% of Argentines are [[Catholicism in Argentina|Roman Catholic]], 11.3% religiously indifferent, 9% [[Protestant]] (with 7.9% in [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] denominations), 1.2% [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and 0.9% [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/08/27/um/encuesta1.pdf |title=Encuesta CONICET sobre creencias|format=PDF |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Jews account for less than 1% of Argentina's population, [[Buenos Aires]] has the [[History of the Jews in Argentina|second largest population of Jews]] in the Americas, second only to New York City. Argentina also has the largest [[Muslim]] minority in Latin America (see [[Islam in Argentina]]).\n\n==Emigration==\nMost Argentines outside Argentina are people who have migrated from the middle and upper middle classes. According to official estimates there are 600,000 worldwide Argentine, according to estimates by the [[International Organization for Migration]] are about 806,369 since 2001. It is estimated that their descendants would be around 1,900,000. The first wave of emigration occurred during the military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983, with principally to Spain, USA, Mexico and Venezuela. During the 1990s, due to the abolition of visas between Argentina and the United States, thousands of Argentines emigrated to the North American country. The last major wave of emigration occurred during the 2001 crisis, mainly to Europe, especially Spain, although there was also an increase in emigration to neighboring countries, particularly Brazil, Chile and Paraguay.\n\n===Europe===\n{{See also|Argentines in Spain}}\nThe rate of Argentine emigration to Europe (especially to [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901030120-407301,00.html|title=Argentine's reclaim Italian roots - TIME|date=12 January 2003|work=TIME.com|accessdate=29 March 2015|first=JEFF|last=ISRAELY/Feltre}}</ref>) peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s and is noteworthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ime.gob.mx/noticias/boletines_lazos/2005/301.htm|title=Version 1|accessdate=29 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051036/http://www.ime.gob.mx/noticias/boletines_lazos/2005/301.htm|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Spain and Italy have the largest Argentine communities in Europe, however, there are also important communities in [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]].\n\n===Americas===\n{{See also|Argentine American|Argentine Canadian|Argentine immigration to Mexico|Argentine Brazilian|Argentines in Uruguay}}\nThe most popular immigration destinations in the Americas are: the [[United States]], [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]], and to a lesser degree, South America (mostly to [[Uruguay]] and [[Brazil]]): [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], while other communities settled in [[Venezuela]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Costa Rica]].\n\n===Middle East===\n{{See also|Argentines in Israel}}\n[[Israel]] is home to the largest Argentine diaspora group in Asia.\n\n===Oceania===\n{{See also|Argentine Australian}}\nIn Oceania, [[Australia]] has the largest Argentine community, followed by [[New Zealand]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Argentina}}\n{{col-start}}{{col-2}}\n* [[List of Argentines]]\n* [[Ethnography of Argentina]]\n* [[Demographics of Argentina]]\n* [[Immigration to Argentina]]\n* [[History of Argentine nationality]]\n{{col-break}}{{col-2}}\n* [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina]]\n* [[Latin Americans]]\n* [[Argentines in Uruguay]]\n* [[Argentina]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100715204408/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1482 About Argentine population] at www.Argentina.gov.ar {{in lang|en}}\n\n{{Immigration to Argentina}}\n{{Argentina topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Argentine People}}\n[[Category:Argentine people]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Argentina|+]]\n[[Category:South American people by nationality]]\n", "name_user": "RicardoMontano2323", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentines"}
