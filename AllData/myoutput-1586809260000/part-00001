These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A [[Dungeon Master]] (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world. The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, and gather treasure and knowledge.

A pair of d10 can be used together to represent percentile dice, or d100.]]\n\nBefore the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#Ability scores|ability scores]], which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics.<ref>The original game used [[Dice notation|3d6]] in the order rolled (Gygax, Arneson; ''Dungeons & Dragons''). Variants have since been included (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 11) and the standard for 3rd edition is \"rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three\" (Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' [3.0], p. 4), arranging the results in any order desired. 4th edition allows for a \"point buy\" system.</ref> The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.\n\nDuring the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response.<ref>Tweet; ''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game'' p. 24</ref> Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice.<ref name=\"Culture chapter\">{{Harvnb|Williams|Hendricks|Winkler|2006}} \"The Role-Playing Game and the Game of Role-Playing\"</ref>  Different polyhedral dice are used for different actions, such as a twenty-sided die to see whether a hit was made in combat, but an eight-sided die to determine how much damage was dealt.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gmdice.com/pages/dungeons-dragons-dice |title=Dungeons & Dragons Dice |website=gmdice.com |access-date=August 20, 2019}}</ref>  Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills and the difficulty of the task.<ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 62</ref> In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a [[saving throw]] can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided.<ref name=\"PHB p.136\">Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 136</ref><ref>\"Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect.\" There is identical language in sections titled 'Saving Throws' in (Tweet 2000:119).</ref> In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.<ref name=\"PHB p.136\"/><ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' (3.0), pp. 119\u2013120</ref>\n\nAs the game is played, each PC changes over time and generally increases in capability.

They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.<ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 145</ref> Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 289</ref> or character levels.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 296</ref> When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 41</ref>\n\n===Adventures and campaigns===\n{{Main|Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings}}\n\nA typical ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game consists of an \"adventure\", which is roughly equivalent to a single story.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 43</ref> The DM can either design an original adventure, or follow one of the many pre-made adventures (also known as \"modules\") that have been published throughout the history of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled \"[[Temple of the Frog]]\" was included in the ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone ''D&D'' module published by TSR was 1978's ''[[Steading of the Hill Giant Chief]]'', written by Gygax.\n\nA linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a \"[[campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]\".<ref>\"A ''D&D'' campaign is an organized framework... to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures.\" ([[Aaron Allston|Allston]]; ''Rules Cyclopedia'', p. 256)</ref> The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire [[fictional universe]], are referred to as \"[[campaign setting]]s\" or \"world\".<ref>\"It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably&nbsp;...

The grid mat underneath uses one-inch squares.]]\n\nThe [[wargaming|wargames]] from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. ''D&D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' miniatures game for combat resolution.<ref>Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 23</ref> By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.<ref>The first ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures. (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 10)</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include [[Grenadier Miniatures]] (1980\u20131983),<ref>Pope; Grenadier Models</ref> [[Citadel Miniatures]] (1984\u20131986),<ref>Scott; Otherworld</ref> [[Ral Partha]],<ref>Pope; Ral Partha</ref> and TSR itself.<ref>Pope; TSR</ref> Most of these miniatures used the 25&nbsp;mm scale.\n\nPeriodically, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of ''Chainmail'' (2001)<ref>Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design; List of Winners (2002)</ref> provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.\n\n==Game history==\n\n===Sources and influences===\n{{Main|Sources and influences on the development of Dungeons & Dragons}}\n\nAn immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by [[Jeff Perren]]. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]''. When [[Dave Wesely]] entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer [[Dave Arneson]] began a medieval variation of Wesely's [[Braunstein (wargame)|Braunstein]] games, where players control individuals instead of armies.<ref name=\"DW3\">Arneson; \"My Life and Role Playing\" in ''Different Worlds'' #3</ref> Arneson used ''Chainmail'' to resolve combat.<ref name=\"Banshee_Gygax\">{{Harvnb|Birnbaum|2004}}</ref> As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others.<ref name=\"DW3\"/> Having partnered previously with Gygax on ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship!]]'', Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing \"The Fantasy Game\", the game that became ''Dungeons & Dragons'', with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\">[[Dungeons & Dragons#refMead|Mead, Malcomson; ''Dungeons & Dragons'' FAQ]]</ref><ref name=\"Wired\">Kushner; Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax</ref><ref name=\"history\">Wizards of the Coast; The History of TSR</ref> The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy; upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, \"Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons & Dragons best!\", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his wife Mary Jo.<ref name=witwer>{{cite book | last = Witwer | first = Michael | title = Empire of the Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | date = 2015 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-63286-279-2}}</ref>{{rp|101}}\n\nMany ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing can be seen in [[improvisational theater]].<ref>Grigg; Albert Goes Narrative Contracting</ref> Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games among others.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 17\u201334</ref> Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.\n\nThe world of ''D&D'' was influenced by world mythology, history, [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy novels. The importance of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as an influence on ''D&D'' is controversial. The presence in the game of [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], orcs, [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|rangers]], and the like, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Tolkien Enterprises]] prompted the name changes of [[hobbit]] to 'halfling', [[ent]] to '[[treant]]', and [[balrog]] to '[[Balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]'. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game.<ref>Kuntz; \"Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons\" in ''Dragon'' #13</ref><ref name=\"Dragon95\">Gygax; \"On the Influence of J. R. R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games\" in ''Dragon'' #95</ref><ref>Drout; \"J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\", p 229</ref> However, in an interview in 2000, he acknowledged that Tolkien's work had a \"strong impact\" though he also said that the list of other influential authors was long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/features/interviews/gary_gygax.html|title=Gary Gygax - Creator of Dungeons & Dragons|work=TheOneRing|accessdate=January 10, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206212135/http://archives.theonering.net/features/interviews/gary_gygax.html|archivedate=December 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe ''D&D'' magic system, in which wizards memorize spells that are used up once cast and must be re-memorized the next day, was heavily influenced by the ''[[Dying Earth series|Dying Earth]]'' stories and novels of [[Jack Vance]].<ref>Gygax; \"The Dungeons and Dragons Magic System\" in ''The Strategic Review'', Vol. 2, No. 2</ref> The original alignment system (which grouped all characters and creatures into 'Law', 'Neutrality' and 'Chaos') was derived from the novel ''[[Three Hearts and Three Lions]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]].<ref name=\"lit_source\"/> A troll described in this work influenced the ''D&D'' definition of that monster.<ref name=\"Dragon95\"/>\n\nOther influences include the works of [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[A. Merritt]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Fletcher Pratt]], [[Roger Zelazny]], and [[Michael Moorcock]].<ref>The first seven listed here are the \"most immediate influences\". (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 224)</ref> Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works such as [[Van vogt|A. E. van Vogt's]] \"Black Destroyer\", [[Coeurl]] (the [[Displacer Beast]]), [[Lewis Carroll]]'s \"[[Jabberwocky]]\" ([[vorpal]] sword) and the [[Book of Genesis]] (the clerical spell 'Blade Barrier' was inspired by the \"[[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]] which turned every way\" at the gates of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]).<ref name=\"lit_source\">DeVarque; Literary Sources of D&D</ref>\n\n===Edition history===\n{{Main|Editions of Dungeons & Dragons}}\n\n''Dungeons & Dragons'' has gone through several revisions.

Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jon | last=Peterson | year=2012 | title=Playing at the World | page=496 | publisher=Unreason| isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 }}</ref> This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]] and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975),<ref>Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp.&nbsp;132\u2013153</ref> as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many [[fanzine]]s.\n\n====Two-pronged strategy====\n\nIn early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide ''D&D'' for nearly two decades. A ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores.<ref name=\"history\"/> Later in 1977, the first part of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (''AD&D'') was published,<ref name=\"history\" /> which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the ''Basic Set'' directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.\n\nAs a result of this parallel development, the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in ''AD&D''. [[John Eric Holmes]], the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. ''AD&D'', on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the \"core rulebooks\", were released: the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985) that included a large number of new rules.<ref name=\"history\"/> Confusing matters further, the original ''D&D'' boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\" />\n\n====Revised editions====\nIn the 1980s, the rules for ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' and \"basic\" ''Dungeons & Dragons'' remained separate, each developing along different paths.\n\nIn 1981, the basic version of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was revised by [[Tom Moldvay]] to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original ''D&D'' tone, whereas ''AD&D'' was promoted as advancement of the mechanics.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> An accompanying ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'', originally written by [[David Cook (game designer)|David \"Zeb\" Cook]], allowed players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by [[Frank Mentzer]] were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|Companion]]'' (1983), ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Master Rules|Master]]'' (1985), and ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals]]'' (1986) sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|title=Basic set|work=Acaeum.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624215519/http://acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|archivedate=June 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Schick 133\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', p. 133</ref> Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the previous.<ref>Gygax; \"Dungeons & Dragons: What Is It and Where Is It Going\" in ''The Dragon'' #21</ref> The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'', which was released alongside a new [[Dungeons & Dragons Game (1991 boxed set)|introductory boxed set]].\n\n''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition'' was published in 1989,<ref name=\"history\"/> again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David \"Zeb\" Cook. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition,<ref>\"This is not ''AD&D'' 3rd edition\" Winter, Steven (in the forward to Cook; ''Player's Handbook'').</ref> and a series of ''Player's Option'' manuals were released as optional rulebooks.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe release of ''AD&D 2nd Edition'' deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types&nbsp;\u2013 such as assassins and half-orcs&nbsp;\u2013 were removed.<ref name=\"Dragon 154\">Ward; \"The Games Wizards: Angry Mothers From Heck (And what we do about them)\" in ''Dragon'' #154</ref> The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s \"sword and sorcery\" fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology.<ref>Cook; ''Player's Handbook'' (1989), pp.&nbsp;25\u201341</ref> The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies&nbsp;\u2013 skill-like abilities that originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements. The game's magic spells were divided into schools and spheres.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\"/> A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy. This included blending fantasy with other genres, such as horror (Ravenloft), science fiction (Spelljammer), and apocalyptic (Dark Sun), as well as alternative historical and non-European mythological settings.<ref>Pryor, Herring, Tweet, Richie; ''[[Creative Campaigning]]''</ref>\n\n====Wizards of the Coast====\nIn 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was purchased by [[Wizards of the Coast]].<ref name=\"briefhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory1.phtml |title=Wizards of the Coast: 1990 \u2013 present |accessdate=September 1, 2006 |last=Appelcline |first=Shannon |date=August 3, 2006 |work=A Brief History of Game |publisher=RPGnet |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824022118/http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory1.phtml |archivedate=August 24, 2006 }}</ref> Following three years of development, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' 3rd edition was released in 2000.<ref>\"After&nbsp;... the idea of acquiring TSR began to swim in my mind it took me maybe thirty seconds to decide, We've got to do a third edition of Dungeons & Dragons.\" ([[Peter Adkison|Adkison, Peter]] in Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 250).</ref> The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game.

Under these licenses, authors were free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements.<ref>Wizards of the Coast; The d20 System</ref> The OGL and d20 Trademark License made possible new games, some based on licensed products like ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Wizards of the Coast)|Star Wars]]'', and new versions of older games, such as ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)#D20 Call of Cthulhu|Call of Cthulhu]]''.\n\nWith the release of the [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition|fourth edition]], Wizards of the Coast introduced its [[Game System License]], which represented a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as [[Paizo Publishing]] with its ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'') who previously produced materials in support of the ''D&D'' product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as [[Kenzer & Company]], are returning to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.<ref>{{cite web\n | author=Anonymous | date=July 9, 2008\n | title=Kenzer & Co, D&D, and Trademarks\n | publisher=Robertson Games | url=http://robertsongames.com/role-playing-games/dungeons-dragons/kenzer-co-dd-and-trademarks\n | accessdate=July 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118102121/http://robertsongames.com/role-playing-games/dungeons-dragons/kenzer-co-dd-and-trademarks|archivedate=January 18, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2000s, there has been a trend towards reviving and recreating older editions of ''D&D'', known as the [[Old School Revival]]. Game systems based on earlier editions of ''D&D''. ''[[Castles & Crusades]]'' (2004), by [[Troll Lord Games]], is a reimagining of early editions by streamlining rules from OGL.<ref>\"Castles & Crusades is a fantasy RPG, clearly based upon the first edition of AD&D but with streamlined d20-like rules.\" (Mythmere; ''Castles & Crusades Players Handbook'' (4.6 stars))</ref> This in turn inspired the creation of [[Dungeons & Dragons retro-clones|\"retro-clones\"]], games which more closely recreate the original rule sets, using material placed under the OGL along with non-copyrightable mechanical aspects of the older rules to create a new presentation of the games.\n\nAlongside the publication of the fifth edition, Wizards of the Coast established a two-pronged licensing approach. The core of the fifth edition rules have been made available under the OGL, while publishers and independent creators have also been given the opportunity to create licensed materials directly for Dungeons & Dragons and associated properties like the Forgotten Realms under a program called the DM's Guild.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://support.dmsguild.com/hc/en-us/articles/217520927-Ownership-and-License-OGL-Questions|title=Ownership and License (OGL) Questions|last=Montgomery|first=Jeff|website=Dungeon Masters Guild|language=en-US|access-date=February 13, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215023616/https://support.dmsguild.com/hc/en-us/articles/217520927-Ownership-and-License-OGL-Questions|archivedate=February 15, 2018}}</ref> The DM's Guild does not function under the OGL, but uses a community agreement intended to foster liberal cooperation among content creators.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Controversy and notoriety===\n\n{{Main|Dungeons & Dragons controversies}}\n\nAt various times in its history, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has received negative publicity, in particular from some [[Christianity|Christian]] groups, for alleged promotion of such practices as [[Satanism#Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], [[witchcraft]], suicide, and murder, and for the presence of naked breasts in drawings of female humanoids in the original ''AD&D'' manuals (mainly monsters such as harpies, [[Succubus (Dungeons & Dragons)|succubi]], etc.).<ref name=\"Moral Panic\">Waldron; Role-Playing Games and the Christian Right</ref><ref name=\"attacks\">Cardwell; \"The Attacks on Role-Playing Games\"</ref> These controversies led TSR to remove many potentially controversial references and artwork when releasing the 2nd Edition of ''AD&D''.<ref name=\"Dragon 154\"/> Many of these references, including the use of the names \"[[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]]\" and \"[[Demon (Dungeons & Dragons)|demons]]\", were reintroduced in the 3rd edition.<ref>Williams, Tweet, Cook; ''Monster Manual'', pp. 41,47</ref> The [[moral panic]] over the game led to problems for fans of ''D&D'' who faced social ostracism, unfair treatment, and false association with the occult and [[Satanism]], regardless of an individual fan's actual religious affiliation and beliefs.<ref>Gagne; Moral Panics Over Youth Culture and Video Games</ref>\n\n''Dungeons & Dragons'' has been the subject of rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to [[psychotic]] episodes.<ref>Darlington; A History of Role-Playing Part IV</ref> The most notable of these was the saga of [[James Dallas Egbert III]],<ref>Hately; The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III (Part I)</ref> the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel ''[[Mazes and Monsters (novel)|Mazes and Monsters]]'' and later made into a [[Mazes and Monsters|TV movie]] in 1982 starring [[Tom Hanks]].<ref name=\"attacks\"/><ref>O'Connor; TV: 'Mazes and Monsters,' Fantasy</ref> The game was blamed for some of the actions of [[Chris Pritchard]], who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather.

These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A [[Dungeon Master]] (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world.

A pair of d10 can be used together to represent percentile dice, or d100.]]\n\nBefore the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#Ability scores|ability scores]], which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics.<ref>The original game used [[Dice notation|3d6]] in the order rolled (Gygax, Arneson; ''Dungeons & Dragons''). Variants have since been included (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 11) and the standard for 3rd edition is \"rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three\" (Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' [3.0], p. 4), arranging the results in any order desired. 4th edition allows for a \"point buy\" system.</ref> The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.\n\nDuring the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response.<ref>Tweet; ''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game'' p. 24</ref> Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful.

They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.<ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 145</ref> Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 289</ref> or character levels.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 296</ref> When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result.

Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled \"[[Temple of the Frog]]\" was included in the ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone ''D&D'' module published by TSR was 1978's ''[[Steading of the Hill Giant Chief]]'', written by Gygax.\n\nA linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a \"[[campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]\".<ref>\"A ''D&D'' campaign is an organized framework... to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures.\" ([[Aaron Allston|Allston]]; ''Rules Cyclopedia'', p. 256)</ref> The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire [[fictional universe]], are referred to as \"[[campaign setting]]s\" or \"world\".<ref>\"It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably&nbsp;... A world is a fictional place in which a campaign is set. It's also often called a campaign setting.\" (Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 129)</ref> ''D&D'' settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology.<ref>Williams ; ''Dungeon Master Option: High Level Campaigns'', p. 45</ref> Popular commercially published [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for ''Dungeons & Dragons'']] include [[Greyhawk]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Mystara]], [[Spelljammer]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Dark Sun]], [[Planescape]], [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]], and [[Eberron]].\n\nIn addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created.

The grid mat underneath uses one-inch squares.]]\n\nThe [[wargaming|wargames]] from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. ''D&D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' miniatures game for combat resolution.<ref>Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 23</ref> By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.<ref>The first ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures. (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 10)</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include [[Grenadier Miniatures]] (1980\u20131983),<ref>Pope; Grenadier Models</ref> [[Citadel Miniatures]] (1984\u20131986),<ref>Scott; Otherworld</ref> [[Ral Partha]],<ref>Pope; Ral Partha</ref> and TSR itself.<ref>Pope; TSR</ref> Most of these miniatures used the 25&nbsp;mm scale.\n\nPeriodically, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of ''Chainmail'' (2001)<ref>Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design; List of Winners (2002)</ref> provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.\n\n==Game history==\n\n===Sources and influences===\n{{Main|Sources and influences on the development of Dungeons & Dragons}}\n\nAn immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by [[Jeff Perren]]. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]''. When [[Dave Wesely]] entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer [[Dave Arneson]] began a medieval variation of Wesely's [[Braunstein (wargame)|Braunstein]] games, where players control individuals instead of armies.<ref name=\"DW3\">Arneson; \"My Life and Role Playing\" in ''Different Worlds'' #3</ref> Arneson used ''Chainmail'' to resolve combat.<ref name=\"Banshee_Gygax\">{{Harvnb|Birnbaum|2004}}</ref> As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others.<ref name=\"DW3\"/> Having partnered previously with Gygax on ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship!]]'', Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing \"The Fantasy Game\", the game that became ''Dungeons & Dragons'', with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\">[[Dungeons & Dragons#refMead|Mead, Malcomson; ''Dungeons & Dragons'' FAQ]]</ref><ref name=\"Wired\">Kushner; Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax</ref><ref name=\"history\">Wizards of the Coast; The History of TSR</ref> The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy; upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, \"Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons & Dragons best!\", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his wife Mary Jo.<ref name=witwer>{{cite book | last = Witwer | first = Michael | title = Empire of the Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | date = 2015 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-63286-279-2}}</ref>{{rp|101}}\n\nMany ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing can be seen in [[improvisational theatre]].<ref>Grigg; Albert Goes Narrative Contracting</ref> Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games among others.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 17\u201334</ref> Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.\n\nThe world of ''D&D'' was influenced by world mythology, history, [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy novels. The importance of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as an influence on ''D&D'' is controversial. The presence in the game of [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], orcs, [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|rangers]], and the like, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Tolkien Enterprises]] prompted the name changes of [[hobbit]] to 'halfling', [[ent]] to '[[treant]]', and [[balrog]] to '[[Balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]'.

Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jon | last=Peterson | year=2012 | title=Playing at the World | page=496 | publisher=Unreason| isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 }}</ref> This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]] and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975),<ref>Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp.&nbsp;132\u2013153</ref> as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many [[fanzine]]s.\n\n====Two-pronged strategy====\n\nIn early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide ''D&D'' for nearly two decades. A ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores.<ref name=\"history\"/> Later in 1977, the first part of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (''AD&D'') was published,<ref name=\"history\" /> which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the ''Basic Set'' directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.\n\nAs a result of this parallel development, the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in ''AD&D''. [[John Eric Holmes]], the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. ''AD&D'', on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the \"core rulebooks\", were released: the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985) that included a large number of new rules.<ref name=\"history\"/> Confusing matters further, the original ''D&D'' boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\" />\n\n====Revised editions====\nIn the 1980s, the rules for ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' and \"basic\" ''Dungeons & Dragons'' remained separate, each developing along different paths.\n\nIn 1981, the basic version of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was revised by [[Tom Moldvay]] to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original ''D&D'' tone, whereas ''AD&D'' was promoted as advancement of the mechanics.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> An accompanying ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'', originally written by [[David Cook (game designer)|David \"Zeb\" Cook]], allowed players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by [[Frank Mentzer]] were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|Companion]]'' (1983), ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Master Rules|Master]]'' (1985), and ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals]]'' (1986) sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|title=Basic set|work=Acaeum.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624215519/http://acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|archivedate=June 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Schick 133\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', p. 133</ref> Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the previous.<ref>Gygax; \"Dungeons & Dragons: What Is It and Where Is It Going\" in ''The Dragon'' #21</ref> The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'', which was released alongside a new [[Dungeons & Dragons Game (1991 boxed set)|introductory boxed set]].\n\n''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition'' was published in 1989,<ref name=\"history\"/> again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David \"Zeb\" Cook. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition,<ref>\"This is not ''AD&D'' 3rd edition\" Winter, Steven (in the forward to Cook; ''Player's Handbook'').</ref> and a series of ''Player's Option'' manuals were released as optional rulebooks.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe release of ''AD&D 2nd Edition'' deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types&nbsp;\u2013 such as assassins and half-orcs&nbsp;\u2013 were removed.<ref name=\"Dragon 154\">Ward; \"The Games Wizards: Angry Mothers From Heck (And what we do about them)\" in ''Dragon'' #154</ref> The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s \"sword and sorcery\" fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology.<ref>Cook; ''Player's Handbook'' (1989), pp.&nbsp;25\u201341</ref> The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies&nbsp;\u2013 skill-like abilities that originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements. The game's magic spells were divided into schools and spheres.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\"/> A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy.

''[[Castles & Crusades]]'' (2004), by [[Troll Lord Games]], is a reimagining of early editions by streamlining rules from OGL.<ref>\"Castles & Crusades is a fantasy RPG, clearly based upon the first edition of AD&D but with streamlined d20-like rules.\" (Mythmere; ''Castles & Crusades Players Handbook'' (4.6 stars))</ref> This in turn inspired the creation of [[Dungeons & Dragons retro-clones|\"retro-clones\"]], games which more closely recreate the original rule sets, using material placed under the OGL along with non-copyrightable mechanical aspects of the older rules to create a new presentation of the games.\n\nAlongside the publication of the fifth edition, Wizards of the Coast established a two-pronged licensing approach. The core of the fifth edition rules have been made available under the OGL, while publishers and independent creators have also been given the opportunity to create licensed materials directly for Dungeons & Dragons and associated properties like the Forgotten Realms under a program called the DM's Guild.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://support.dmsguild.com/hc/en-us/articles/217520927-Ownership-and-License-OGL-Questions|title=Ownership and License (OGL) Questions|last=Montgomery|first=Jeff|website=Dungeon Masters Guild|language=en-US|access-date=February 13, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215023616/https://support.dmsguild.com/hc/en-us/articles/217520927-Ownership-and-License-OGL-Questions|archivedate=February 15, 2018}}</ref> The DM's Guild does not function under the OGL, but uses a community agreement intended to foster liberal cooperation among content creators.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Controversy and notoriety===\n\n{{Main|Dungeons & Dragons controversies}}\n\nAt various times in its history, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has received negative publicity, in particular from some [[Christianity|Christian]] groups, for alleged promotion of such practices as [[Satanism#Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], [[witchcraft]], suicide, and murder, and for the presence of naked breasts in drawings of female humanoids in the original ''AD&D'' manuals (mainly monsters such as harpies, [[Succubus (Dungeons & Dragons)|succubi]], etc.).<ref name=\"Moral Panic\">Waldron; Role-Playing Games and the Christian Right</ref><ref name=\"attacks\">Cardwell; \"The Attacks on Role-Playing Games\"</ref> These controversies led TSR to remove many potentially controversial references and artwork when releasing the 2nd Edition of ''AD&D''.<ref name=\"Dragon 154\"/> Many of these references, including the use of the names \"[[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]]\" and \"[[Demon (Dungeons & Dragons)|demons]]\", were reintroduced in the 3rd edition.<ref>Williams, Tweet, Cook; ''Monster Manual'', pp. 41,47</ref> The [[moral panic]] over the game led to problems for fans of ''D&D'' who faced social ostracism, unfair treatment, and false association with the occult and [[Satanism]], regardless of an individual fan's actual religious affiliation and beliefs.<ref>Gagne; Moral Panics Over Youth Culture and Video Games</ref>\n\n''Dungeons & Dragons'' has been the subject of rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to [[psychotic]] episodes.<ref>Darlington; A History of Role-Playing Part IV</ref> The most notable of these was the saga of [[James Dallas Egbert III]],<ref>Hately; The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III (Part I)</ref> the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel ''[[Mazes and Monsters (novel)|Mazes and Monsters]]'' and later made into a [[Mazes and Monsters|TV movie]] in 1982 starring [[Tom Hanks]].<ref name=\"attacks\"/><ref>O'Connor; TV: 'Mazes and Monsters,' Fantasy</ref> The game was blamed for some of the actions of [[Chris Pritchard]], who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather.
