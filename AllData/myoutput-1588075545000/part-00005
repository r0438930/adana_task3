His father died in Gopal's childhood and his mother was forced to [[Sati-daha]], his elder brother became a slave and he was abducted by a robber gang, where a lady raised him and at an adult age Gopal entered in Krishnanagar Raj. The witty and comic stories of Gopal Bhar have enormous literary value in children's literature and they are cherished by the people of all ages. Kids in Bengal grown-up either reading or listening  the stories of this exceptionally intelligent and funny character. \n\nGopal Bhar was a typical villager with no formal education but he became a larger than life character because of his phenomenal intellect and brilliant sense of humor. He was not merely an ordinary court jester, he was a dignified man with a strong sense of justice. In many stories, he has volunteered to recorrect the unjust decisions taken by Raja Krishnachandra, the-then king of Nadia. We cannot simply pass him just as a funny guy, rather we should remember Gopal Bhar as an enlightened personality of Bengal who has chosen humor as the best medium to educate, civilize and uplift the community.\n\n==Stories==\nStories about his exploits are narrated in [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]] to this day in numerous short stories. The stories are popular, short, beautiful, humorous and have a specific social message. His stories are comparable with those of [[Birbal]], [[Tenali Raman]], [[ Gonu Jha]] and [[Nasreddin]].\n\n==Authenticity==\nIn early nineteenth century, Gopal Bhar's name was first mentioned in Bengali literature. It is often said that Gopal Bhar is a legendary personality. But a reference has found that there was a respectful and old bodyguard of the king of Nadia, [[Raja Krishnachandra]] and Protection incharge of the city named [[Shankar Taranga]] who was given special status by the king for his courage and knowledge and probably gave rise to the legend of Gopal Bhar. There are many contradictory views regarding Gopal Bhar, whether he existed or not. Acharya [[Sukumar Sen (linguist)]] opined that the character Gopal is purely fictitious.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* ''Gopal Bhar'', a Bengali comedy film directed by Amal Sur was released in 1980.
