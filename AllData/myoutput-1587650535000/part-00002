She only swum in the heats of the [[Swimming at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle]] and the [[Swimming at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 200 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7200&nbsp;m freestyle events]]. She competed in the [[2006 European Aquatics Championships|European LC Championships 2006]] and the [[European Short Course Swimming Championships]]. But individually she did not advance past the heats in both events.\n\nAt the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships|World LC Championships 2007]] she won a bronze medal in the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle]] together with [[Inge Dekker]], [[Ranomi Kromowidjojo]] and [[Marleen Veldhuis]].

She won her first individual medal, a silver medal, in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle at the last day of the tournament. During the National Championships in June 2008, Heemskerk lowered three national records on the long course, 200&nbsp;m freestyle, 200&nbsp;m individual medley and 100&nbsp;m backstroke.\n\n===2008 Summer Olympics===\nAt the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]] she won a gold medal with the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle relay]]. She did so alongside [[Inge Dekker]], [[Ranomi Kromowidjojo]] and [[Marleen Veldhuis]] in a time of 3:33.76, just 0.14 outside their own world record. The day after she competed individually in the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 200 metre individual medley|200&nbsp;m individual medley]] where she finished 28th during the heats. Heemskerk was the lead-off swimmer in both [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 200 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7200&nbsp;m freestyle]] and [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m medley relays]], both of which did not qualify for the finals.\n\n===Fall 2008===\nAfter the Olympics Heemskerk returned to competition at the [[2008 European Aquatics Championships]] where she qualified for the [[2009 World Aquatics Championships]] in the [[Swimming at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 100 metre freestyle|100&nbsp;m]] and [[Swimming at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 200 metre freestyle|200&nbsp;m freestyle]]. The week afterwards she participated in the [[2008 European Short Course Swimming Championships]] in [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]. There she won a silver medal in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle behind [[Federica Pellegrini]]. She also finished fifth in the 100&nbsp;m medley.
