For a given radiation field, the absorbed dose will depend on the type of matter which absorbs the radiation. For instance, for an exposure of 1 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] by gamma rays with an energy of 1 [[MeV]], the dose in air will be 0.877 [[rad (unit)|rad]], the dose in [[water]] will be 0.975 rad, the dose in [[silicon]] will be 0.877 rad, and the dose in averaged [[tissue (biology)|human tissue]] will be 1 rad. A table giving the exposure to dose conversion for these four materials for a variety of gamma ray energies can be found in the reference.<ref>Carron, p. 141</ref>\n\n==Exposure rate constant==\nThe gamma ray field can be characterized by the exposure rate (in units of, for instance, [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] per hour). For a point source, the exposure rate will be linearly proportional to the source's [[radioactivity]] and inversely proportional to the square of the distance,<ref>Knoll, p. 57</ref>\n\n:F = \u0393\u00d7\u03b1 / r<sup>2</sup>\n\nwhere ''F'' is the exposure rate, ''r'' is the distance, ''\u03b1'' is the source activity, and ''\u0393'' is the exposure rate constant, which is dependent on the particular [[radionuclide]] used as the gamma ray source.\n\nBelow is a table of exposure rate constants for various radionuclides.
