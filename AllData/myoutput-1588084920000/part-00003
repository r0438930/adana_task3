The female matures at two years old and the male at three years old. \n\nBetween June and August, males return to shore to renovate or dig new burrows and display to attract a mate for the season. Males compete for partners with their displays. Breeding occurs annually, but the timing and duration of the breeding season varies from location to location and from year to year. Breeding occurs during spring and summer when oceans are most productive and food is plentiful. \n\nLittle penguins remain faithful to their partner during a breeding season and whilst hatching eggs. At other times of the year they tend to swap burrows. They exhibit [[philopatry|site fidelity]] to their nesting colonies and nesting sites over successive years. Little penguins can breed as isolated pairs, in colonies, or semi-colonially.<ref name=\"Flemming\" />\n\n==== Nesting ====\nPenguins' nests vary depending on the available habitat. They are established close to the sea in sandy burrows excavated by the birds' feet or dug previously by other animals. Nests may also be made in caves, rock crevices, under logs or in or under a variety of man-made structures including nest boxes, pipes, stacks of wood or timber, and buildings. Nests have been occasionally observed to be shared with [[Prion (bird)|prions]], while some burrows are occupied by [[Short-tailed shearwater|short-tailed shearwaters]] and little penguins in alternating seasons. In the 1980s, little was known on the subject of competition for burrows between bird species.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==== Timing ====\nThe timing of breeding seasons varies across the species' range. In the 1980s, the first egg laid at a penguin colony on Australia's eastern coast could be expected to come as early as May or as late as October. Eastern Australian populations (including at Phillip Island, Victoria) lay their eggs from July to December.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://penguinfoundation.org.au/about-little-penguins/#Yearly1|title=About Little Penguins|website=penguinfoundation.org.au|access-date=3 April 2016}}</ref> In South Australia's [[Gulf St Vincent|Gulf St. Vincent]], eggs are laid between April and October<ref name=\":7\">Wiebkin, A.

They are the only species of penguin capable of producing more than one clutch of eggs per breeding season, but few populations do so. In ideal conditions, a penguin pair is capable of raising two or even three clutches of eggs over an extended season, which can last between eight and twenty-eight weeks.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nThe one or two (on rare occasions, three) white or lightly mottled brown eggs are laid between one and four days apart. Each egg typically weighs around 55 grams at time of laying.<ref name=\":9\" /> Incubation takes up to 36 days. Chicks are brooded for 18\u201338 days and fledge after 7\u20138 weeks.<ref name=\"Flemming\" /> On Australia's east coast, chicks are raised from August to March.<ref name=\":6\" /> In Gulf St. Vincent, chicks are raised from June through November.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nLittle penguins typically return to their colonies to feed their chicks at dusk. The birds tend to come ashore in small groups to provide some defence against predators, which might otherwise pick off individuals. In Australia, the strongest colonies are usually on cat-free and fox-free islands. However, the population on [[Granite Island (South Australia)|Granite Island]] (which is a fox, cat and dog-free island) has been severely depleted, from around 2000 penguins in 2001 down to 22 in 2015. Granite Island is connected to the mainland via a timber causeway.\n\n== Native predators ==\nPredation by native animals is not considered a threat to little penguin populations, as these predators' diets are diverse.

The female matures at two years old and the male at three years old. \n\nBetween June and August, males return to shore to renovate or dig new burrows and display to attract a mate for the season. Males compete for partners with their displays. Breeding occurs annually, but the timing and duration of the breeding season varies from location to location and from year to year. Breeding occurs during spring and summer when oceans are most productive and food is plentiful. \n\nLittle penguins remain faithful to their partner during a breeding season and whilst hatching eggs. At other times of the year they tend to swap burrows. They exhibit [[philopatry|site fidelity]] to their nesting colonies and nesting sites over successive years. Little penguins can breed as isolated pairs, in colonies, or semi-colonially.<ref name=\"Flemming\" />\n\n==== Nesting ====\nPenguins' nests vary depending on the available habitat. They are established close to the sea in sandy burrows excavated by the birds' feet or dug previously by other animals. Nests may also be made in caves, rock crevices, under logs or in or under a variety of man-made structures including nest boxes, pipes, stacks of wood or timber, and buildings. Nests have been occasionally observed to be shared with [[Prion (bird)|prions]], while some burrows are occupied by [[Short-tailed shearwater|short-tailed shearwaters]] and little penguins in alternating seasons. In the 1980s, little was known on the subject of competition for burrows between bird species.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==== Timing ====\nThe timing of breeding seasons varies across the species' range. In the 1980s, the first egg laid at a penguin colony on Australia's eastern coast could be expected to come as early as May or as late as October.

In ideal conditions, a penguin pair is capable of raising two or even three clutches of eggs over an extended season, which can last between eight and twenty-eight weeks.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nThe one or two (on rare occasions, three) white or lightly mottled brown eggs are laid between one and four days apart. Each egg typically weighs around 55 grams at time of laying.<ref name=\":9\" /> Incubation takes up to 36 days.

However, the population on [[Granite Island (South Australia)|Granite Island]] (which is a fox, cat and dog-free island) has been severely depleted, from around 2000 penguins in 2001 down to 22 in 2015.
