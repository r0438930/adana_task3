A railroad was m used in the construction of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] fortress at [[Louisburg, Nova Scotia]], in [[New France]] (now [[Canada]]) in 1720. Between 1762 and 1764, at the close of the [[French and Indian War]] (1756\u20131763), a [[gravity railroad]] ([[tramway (industrial)|mechanized tramway]]) ([[Montresor's Tramway]]) is built by [[British Army|British military engineers]] up the steep riverside terrain near the [[Niagara River]] waterfall's [[escarpment]] at the [[Niagara Portage]]  (which the local [[Seneca people|Seneca]]s called ''\"Crawl on All Fours.\"'') in [[Lewiston, New York]].\n\nRailroads played a large role in the development of the [[United States]] from the [[industrial revolution]] in the [[Northeastern United States|North-east]] (1810\u20131850) to the settlement of the West (1850\u20131890). The American railroad mania began with the founding of the first passenger and freight line in the nation of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1827 and the \"Laying of the First Stone\" ceremonies and beginning of its long construction heading westward over the obstacles of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] eastern chain the following year of 1828, and flourished with continuous railway building projects for the next 45 years until the financial  [[Panic of 1873]] followed by a major [[economic depression]] bankrupted many companies and temporarily stymied and ended growth.\n\nAlthough the antebellum South started early to build railways, it concentrated on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports, and the absence of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860 before the war. In the heavily settled Midwestern [[Corn Belt]], over 80 percent of farms were within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs, and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on [[Wall Street]] and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.\n\nThe system was largely built by 1910, but then trucks arrived to eat away the freight traffic, and automobiles (and later airplanes) to devour the passenger traffic. After 1940, the use of diesel electric locomotives made for much more efficient operations that needed fewer workers on the road and in repair shops.\n\nA series of bankruptcies and consolidations left the rail system in the hands of a few large operations by the 1980s. Almost all long-distance passenger traffic was shifted to [[Amtrak]] in 1971, a government-owned operation. Commuter rail service is provided near a few major cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia. Computerization and improved equipment steadily reduced employment, which peaked at 2.1 million in 1920, falling to 1.2 million in 1950 and 215,000 in 2010. Route mileage peaked at {{convert|254251|mi|km}} in 1916 and fell to {{convert|139,679|mi|km}} in 2011.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970'' (1976) table Q398; ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012.''

Hunter, ''Steamboats on the Western rivers: An economic and technological history'' (1949) ch 15</ref> The railroads were superior to these alternative modes of transportation, particularly water routes because they lowered costs in two ways. Canals and rivers were unavailable in the winter season due to freezing, but the railroads ran year-round despite poor weather. And railroads were safer: the likelihood of a train crash was less than the likelihood of a boat sinking. The railroads provided cost-effective transportation because they allowed shippers to have a smaller inventory of goods, which reduced storage costs during winter, and to avoid insurance costs from the risk of losing goods during transit.<ref name=\"BFDC\">{{cite book|author=United States.

For the common person in the early 1800s, transportation was often traveled by horse or stagecoach. The network of trails along which coaches navigated were riddled with ditches, potholes, and stones. This made travel fairly uncomfortable. Adding to injury, coaches were cramped with little leg room. Travel by train offered a new style. Locomotives proved themselves a smooth, headache free ride with plenty of room to move around. Some passenger trains offered meals in the spacious dining car followed by a good night sleep in the private sleeping quarters.<ref name=\"Mark Twain\">{{cite book|author=Mark Twain|title=Roughing It|url=http://www.mtwain.com/roughing_it/5.html|year=1872|publisher=American Publishing Company|page=13}}</ref>\nRailroad companies in the North and Midwest constructed networks that linked nearly every major city by 1860.

Although the transcontinental railroads dominated the media, with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869 dramatically symbolizing the nation's unification after the divisiveness of the Civil War, most construction actually took place in the industrial Northeast and agricultural Midwest, and was designed to minimize shipping times and costs.<ref>{{Grant-Twilight|pages=1\u201320}}</ref> The railroads in the South were repaired and expanded and then, after a lot of preparation, changed from a 5-foot gauge to [[standard gauge]] of 4 foot 8 \u00bd inches in two days in May 1886.<ref>Southern railroad gauge change [http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1966/66-8/gauge.html] accessed 13 Mar 201.</ref>\n\nWith its extensive river system, the United States supported a large array of horse-drawn or mule-drawn barges on canals and [[paddle wheel]] steamboats on rivers that competed with railroads after 1815 until the 1870s.  The canals and steamboats lost out because of the dramatic increases in efficiency and speed of the railroads, which could go almost anywhere year round. The railroads were faster and went to many places a canal would be impractical or too expensive to build or a natural river never went. Railroads also had better scheduling since they often could go year round, more or less ignoring the weather. Canals and river traffic were cheaper if you lived on or near a canal or river that wasn't frozen over part of the year, but only a few did. Long distance transport of goods by wagon to a canal or river was slow and expensive. A railroad to a city made it an inland \"port\" that often prospered or turned a town into a city.<ref>Albert W.

Practically all the mills and factories supplying rails and equipment were in the North, and the Union blockade kept the South from getting new equipment or spare parts. The war was fought in the South, and Union raiders (and sometimes Confederates too) systematically destroyed bridges and [[rolling stock]] \u2014 and sometimes bent rails \u2014 to hinder the logistics of the enemy.<ref>See: Robert C.

Most transports was by boat, not rail, and after the Union blockaded the ports in 1861 and seized the key rivers in 1862, long-distance travel was difficult. The outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the railroad companies, for the hoarding of the cotton crop in an attempt to force European intervention left railroads bereft of their main source of income.<ref name=\"Ramsdell\">Charles W.

In addition, other [[transcontinental railroad|transcontinentals]] were built in the South ([[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]], [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]]) and in the North along the Canada\u2013US border ([[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific]], [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]]), accelerating the settlement of the West by offering inexpensive farms and ranches on credit, carrying pioneers and supplies westward, and cattle, wheat and minerals eastward. In 1860 before the transcontinentals, railroads carried less than half as much freight as inland waterways, whereas by 1890 railroads carried five times as much freight as waterways.\n\n[[File:Harpers 8 11 1877 6th Regiment Fighting Baltimore.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Strikers in Baltimore confronting the Maryland National Guard, July 1877.]]\nDuring the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], Northern money financed the rebuilding and dramatic expansion of railroads throughout the South; they were modernized in terms of [[track gauge]], equipment and standards of service. The Southern network expanded from 11,000 miles (17,700&nbsp;km) in 1870 to 29,000 miles (46,700&nbsp;km) in 1890. The lines were owned and directed overwhelmingly by Northerners.

The failed lines included the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and the [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad]].

Lines with hundreds or thousands of employees developed systematic rules and procedures, not only for running the equipment but in hiring, promoting, paying and supervising employees. The railway system of management was adopted by all major business sectors. Railways offered a new type of work experience in enterprises vastly larger in size, complexity and management. At first workers were recruited from occupations where skills were roughly analogous and transferable, that is, workshop mechanics from the iron, machine and building trades; [[Conductor (transportation)|conductors]] from [[stagecoach]] drivers, steamship stewards and mail boat captains; [[station master]]s from commerce and commission agencies; and clerks from government offices.<ref>{{cite book |last=Licht |first=Walter |date=1987 |title=Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691102214}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the strikes of the 1870s and 1880s, Congress passed the ''Arbitration Act of 1888,'' which authorized the creation of [[arbitration]] panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards.<ref>Arbitration Act of 1888, {{USStat|25|501}}, October 1, 1888.</ref> The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 [[Pullman Strike]], issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a [[United States district court|federal court]] [[injunction]] backed by federal troops.\n\n[[File:Railroad Coupling (CMRR).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Janney coupler|Automatic couplers]] were required by the 1893 [[Railroad Safety Appliance Act|Safety Appliance Act]].]]\nCongress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the [[Erdman Act]], passed in 1898.<ref>Erdman Act of 1898, June 1, 1898, ch. 370, {{USStat|30|424}}.</ref> This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited \"yellow dog\" contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used.

Many accidents were associated with the [[Railway coupling|coupling and uncoupling]] of railroad cars, and the operation of manually operated brakes ([[Parking brake#Railroad hand brakes|hand brakes]]). The rise in accidents led to calls for safety legislation, as early as the 1870s.<ref name=\"McDonald\">{{cite book |title=The Federal Railroad Safety Program |last=McDonald |first=Charles|year=1993 |publisher=U.S. Federal Railroad Administration |location=Washington, DC|url=http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/safety/rail_safety_program_booklet_v2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731183723/http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/safety/rail_safety_program_booklet_v2.pdf |archive-date=2009-07-31}}</ref>{{rp|2\u20134}} In the 1880s, the number of on-the-job fatalities of railroad workers was second only to those of [[Coal mining|coal miners]].<ref name=\"McDonald\" />{{rp|5}} Through that decade, several [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] enacted safety laws.

The generation between 1865 and 1895 was already mortgaged to the railways, and no one knew it better than the generation itself.<ref>Henry Adams, ''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/hadams/eha16.html The Education of Henry Adams'' (1918) p 240] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318035849/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/hadams/eha16.html |date=2017-03-18 }}</ref> \nThe impact can be examined through five aspects: shipping, finance, management, careers, and popular reaction.<ref>George Rogers Taylor, ''The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860'' (New York, 1951).</ref>\n\n===Shipping freight and passengers===\nFirst they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market. The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the Telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. For highly efficient Northern railroads played a major role in winning the Civil War, while the overburdened Southern lines collapsed in the face of an insurmountable challenge.<ref>John E. Clark, Jr., ''Railroads in the Civil War: The Impact of Management on Victory and Defeat'' (2004)</ref>  In the late 19th century pipelines were built for the oil trade, and in the 20th century trucking and aviation emerged.<ref>Leland H.

Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories or canals.  The famous Erie canal, 300 miles long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts.   A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers cost about the same as one mile of track.\n\nIn 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).<ref>Edward C. Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age: Business, labor, and public policy, 1860\u20131897'' (1961) p 52, 68\u201374.</ref>\nFunding came from financiers throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain.<ref>Alfred D.

However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route.  Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. The larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres.<ref>Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age''  (1961) pp 57\u201368.</ref> The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914.<ref>Leland H. Jenks, \"Britain and American railway development.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 11#4 (1951): 375\u2013388.

Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler and Stephen Salsbury. \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\" in Bruce Mazlish, ed., ''The Railroad and the Space Program'' (MIT Press, 1965)  pp 127\u201362</ref>\n\nAfter a serious accident, the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers to keep track of all train movements. Discipline was essential\u2014everyone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow.<ref>Chandler and Salsbury, \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\"  pp 130\u201334</ref> As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations.  The [[Erie Railroad]], faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]\u2014the largest in the world\u2014was making further advances in using bureaucracy under [[John Edgar Thomson]], president 1852\u20131874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., \"The Railroads: Pioneers in Modern Corporate Management\". ''Business History Review'' 1965 39(1): 16\u201340. {{JSTOR|3112463}}.</ref>\n\n=== Career paths===\nThe fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up to the engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57.  Women were not hired.<ref>Walter Licht, ''working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983) p 289</ref>\n\nWhite-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.  At each level, they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care.  Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by the foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be.<ref>Licht, ''Working for the Railroad'' pp 262\u201363. 269.</ref>  Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.<ref>Dora L. Costa, \"The evolution of retirement.\" in  Costa, ''The Evolution of Retirement: An American Economic History, 1880\u20131990'' (U of Chicago Press, 1998), pp 6\u201331 [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c6108.pdf online].</ref>\n\n===Early attitudes towards railroads===\nBoosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people would dress in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that:\n:The startling introduction of railroads into this agricultural society provoked a discussion that soon arrived at the enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignify, expand and enrich the nation. They became part of the public celebrations of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism.]] The rhetoric, the form, and the central figures of civic ceremonies changed to accommodate the intrusion of this technology....[Between 1828 and 1869] Americans integrated the railroad into the national economy and enfolded it within the sublime.<ref>{{cite book|author=David E. Nye|title=American Technological Sublime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrdbOJFxWIoC&pg=PR9|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|page=9|isbn=9780262640343}}</ref>\n\nTravel became much easier, cheaper and more common. Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores.  Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering.  Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:\n: with the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine the United States of continental proportions without the railroad.<ref>Gary S. Cross and Rick Szostak, ''Technology and American society: A history'' (2005) p 102.</ref>\n\nThe engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government.<ref>Robert Zussman, ''Mechanics of the middle class: work and politics among American engineers'' (1985).</ref> By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the [[Pennsylvania Station (1910\u20131963)|Pennsylvania Station in New York City]], and the [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington DC]].<ref>Carl W. Condit, \"Cincinnati Passenger Stations Before 1930,\" ''Railroad History'' No. 132 (1975) pp. 5\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/43520516 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAs early as the 1830s, novelists and poets began fretting that the railroads would destroy the rustic attractions of the American landscape. By the 1840s concerns were rising about terrible accidents when speeding trains crashed into helpless wooden carriages.<ref>George H. Douglas, ''All Aboard! The Railroad in American Life'' (1992), chapter 5</ref> By the 1870s, railroads were vilified by Western farmers who absorbed the Granger movement theme that monopolistic carriers controlled too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to impose maximum prices.

Miller, \"Origins of the Iowa Granger Law,\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 40#4 (1954), pp. 657\u2013680 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1895862 in JSTOR]</ref> Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated  in late 19th century political rhetoric.<ref>Douglas, ''All Aboard!''

Railroads throughout the United States allowed quicker, more efficient transport of goods and people that were previously unavailable. Agriculture, animals, soldiers, goods, and natural resources were now able to move large distances in much shorter amounts of time. As a result, things that were not harvested before like certain tracts of arable land or animal populations were now being used.\n\n=== Galena and Chicago Union Railroad ===\n[[File:Illinois_regions_map.png|thumb|324x324px|A current map showing Chicago, Galena, Springfield,and St. Louis.]]\n[[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad|The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] was the first railway to be built from [[Chicago]]. It never reached Galena, Illinois, but it reached Clinton, Iowa, and Freeport, Illinois. This railroad marked the beginning of Chicago's economic dominance in the Midwest  though transportation of goods such as agriculture and bison hides. Railroads affected the American environment by opening up unexplored, immense tracts of the American wilderness for settlement commercialization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schivelbusch|first=Wolfgang|date=2014|title=The American Railroad|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\nThe idea behind a railroad to Chicago was to steal Midwestern agricultural business from [[St. Louis]], Missouri and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin. The area around Chicago was ideal for a railroad because it was flat and grassy. Citizens of Chicago believed they could use their environment for commercial gain by actually buying goods grown from the land as well as increasing the value the value of adjacent land neighboring the railroad. The Galena and Chicago Union railroad underwent construction in March 1848 to have the railroad run through Chicago, a booming Midwest town. In order to fund this, local Illinoisans pledged together to build a railway because of the potential economic prosperity. William Cronon writes, \u201dBy the following April [1849], over twelve hundred people had pledged to buy stock hypothetically valued at about $350,000, though they had paid only about $20,000 in actual cash.\u201d Farmers were enamored with the idea of a railroad because transporting crops and goods became much easier and more effective than traveling on dirt roads that could easily become muddy or impassable, so they pledged a lot of their money towards the venture. The process of local funding was stock installments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Nature's Metropolis|last=Cronon|first=William|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=1991|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nBy 1852, the Galena and Chicago Union railroad supplied Chicago over half of its wheat. This statistic changed the way people thought about the environment and its railways because railways through the countryside provided Chicagoans with increased wealth; railways became a symbol of mastery over land by being able to transport anything across terrain. This mastery coupled with an aligning of railroads with prosperity and wealth changed the way Chicagoans saw railways. It was a beacon of hope and deliverer of goods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Impact on buffalo population ==\n[[File:\"Rath & Wright's buffalo hide yard in 1878, showing 40,000 buffalo hides, Dodge City, Kansas.\" - NARA - 520093.tif|thumb|323x323px|A buffalo hide yard in Dodge City, Kansas, in 1878.]]\n[[File:William_Temple_Hornaday.jpeg|thumb|236x236px|Willam Hornaday, a leading conservationist of the 19th century.]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, herds of [[American bison|buffalo]] were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4\u20136 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and graze the same land as the bison. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], an influential zoologist and student of the American bison, wrote, \"as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began.\" Railroads gave rise to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hide, meat, and bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could not consume all of the carcasses that were left behind by hunters. There were so many rotting, pungent, bison corpses that nature's scavengers did not have enough power to consume.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Railroaded|last=White|first=Richard|publisher=W.W.

He describes the pristine wilderness \"long before the white man and long before the wheel\" and before pioneers started to build mines, mills, and factories in the verdant land. Because of the optimism for wealth and adventure, Lightfoot claims, \"The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring.\" He also describes the cost this industry had on nature by penning the line, \"Open her heart let the life blood flow.\" He describes nature's heart as being bled by the workers' dreams, which could not be stopped, \"Into the muskeg and into the rain.\" Because man wants to be in control of nature and conquer it, he wants to be able to say,\n\n\"On the mountain tops we stand\n\nAll the world at our command\n\nWe have opened up the soil\n\nWith our teardrops and our toil\"\n\nThrough hard work technology, pioneers and businessmen adapted the environment for their own commercial needs and quest for power.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian Railway Trilogy|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Gordon|work=The Way I Feel}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThere is no question about the importance of railroads in American history.  Churella finds that back in the 1950s business and economic historians, led by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] and [[Robert Fogel]], made railroads the centerpiece of advanced historiography.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven E.

Looking at the voluminous output of railfan authors, Klein says:\n\n:The vast bulk of this work is devoted to minute descriptions of power, rolling stock, obscure short lines, and technical subjects....  But few address the larger questions of railroad history or place their topic in broader contexts.<ref>Maury Klein, ''Unfinished Business: The Railroad in American Life'' (1994) p. 169</ref><ref>Albert J.

Typically they deal with standard topics: the builders and their organizational, legislative and financial dealings; colorful construction crews laying down wood ties and steel rail; the development of locomotives and passenger cars; boosters who sought a stop in their little town else it would die; the 1880\u20131920 golden age of the passenger long-distance travel and local excursions; the steady erosion of passenger service during the automobile age; the freight agent and the small-town depot.

A railroad was reportedly used in the construction of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] fortress at [[Louisburg, Nova Scotia]], in [[New France]] (now [[Canada]]) in 1720. Between 1762 and 1764, at the close of the [[French and Indian War]] (1756\u20131763), a [[gravity railroad]] ([[tramway (industrial)|mechanized tramway]]) ([[Montresor's Tramway]]) is built by [[British Army|British military engineers]] up the steep riverside terrain near the [[Niagara River]] waterfall's [[escarpment]] at the [[Niagara Portage]]  (which the local [[Seneca people|Seneca]]s called ''\"Crawl on All Fours.\"'') in [[Lewiston, New York]].\n\nRailroads played a large role in the development of the [[United States]] from the [[industrial revolution]] in the [[Northeastern United States|North-east]] (1810\u20131850) to the settlement of the West (1850\u20131890). The American railroad mania began with the founding of the first passenger and freight line in the nation of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1827 and the \"Laying of the First Stone\" ceremonies and beginning of its long construction heading westward over the obstacles of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] eastern chain the following year of 1828, and flourished with continuous railway building projects for the next 45 years until the financial  [[Panic of 1873]] followed by a major [[economic depression]] bankrupted many companies and temporarily stymied and ended growth.\n\nAlthough the antebellum South started early to build railways, it concentrated on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports, and the absence of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860 before the war. In the heavily settled Midwestern [[Corn Belt]], over 80 percent of farms were within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs, and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on [[Wall Street]] and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.\n\nThe system was largely built by 1910, but then trucks arrived to eat away the freight traffic, and automobiles (and later airplanes) to devour the passenger traffic. After 1940, the use of diesel electric locomotives made for much more efficient operations that needed fewer workers on the road and in repair shops.\n\nA series of bankruptcies and consolidations left the rail system in the hands of a few large operations by the 1980s. Almost all long-distance passenger traffic was shifted to [[Amtrak]] in 1971, a government-owned operation. Commuter rail service is provided near a few major cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia. Computerization and improved equipment steadily reduced employment, which peaked at 2.1 million in 1920, falling to 1.2 million in 1950 and 215,000 in 2010. Route mileage peaked at {{convert|254251|mi|km}} in 1916 and fell to {{convert|139,679|mi|km}} in 2011.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970'' (1976) table Q398; ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012.''

This became the Crum Creek Branch of the [[Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad]] (part of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]) in 1887.

And railroads were safer: the likelihood of a train crash was less than the likelihood of a boat sinking.

The network of trails along which coaches navigated were riddled with ditches, potholes, and stones. This made travel fairly uncomfortable. Adding to injury, coaches were cramped with little leg room. Travel by train offered a new style. Locomotives proved themselves a smooth, headache free ride with plenty of room to move around.

The railroads were faster and went to many places a canal would be impractical or too expensive to build or a natural river never went. Railroads also had better scheduling since they often could go year round, more or less ignoring the weather. Canals and river traffic were cheaper if you lived on or near a canal or river that wasn't frozen over part of the year, but only a few did. Long distance transport of goods by wagon to a canal or river was slow and expensive. A railroad to a city made it an inland \"port\" that often prospered or turned a town into a city.<ref>Albert W.

Most U.S. roads discontinued use of steam locomotives by the 1950s. A diesel engine was expensive to build, but was less complex and easier to maintain than a steam locomotive, and required only one person to operate. This meant reduced costs and greater reliability for the railroads.<ref name=\"Stover\" />{{rp|213\u201314}} Several companies developed fast [[streamliner]] trains, such as the [[Super Chief]] and the [[California Zephyr]] during the 1930s and 1940s. Their locomotives used either diesel or similar [[internal combustion engine]] designs. ''See'' [[Dieselisation#North America|Dieselisation in North America]].\n\nThough [[electric railway]]s expanded in Europe, they never reached the same popularity in North America. They were built primarily in the [[North-western United States|north-west]] and the [[North-eastern United States|north-east]] beginning in the late 19th century. While some railroads used electric locomotives for both freight and passenger trains, by the end of the 20th century most freight trains were pulled only by diesel locomotives.

Lines with hundreds or thousands of employees developed systematic rules and procedures, not only for running the equipment but in hiring, promoting, paying and supervising employees. The railway system of management was adopted by all major business sectors. Railways offered a new type of work experience in enterprises vastly larger in size, complexity and management. At first workers were recruited from occupations where skills were roughly analogous and transferable, that is, workshop mechanics from the iron, machine and building trades; [[Conductor (transportation)|conductors]] from [[stagecoach]] drivers, steamship stewards and mail boat captains; [[station master]]s from commerce and commission agencies; and clerks from government offices.<ref>{{cite book |last=Licht |first=Walter |date=1987 |title=Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691102214}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the strikes of the 1870s and 1880s, Congress passed the ''Arbitration Act of 1888,'' which authorized the creation of [[arbitration]] panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards.<ref>Arbitration Act of 1888, {{USStat|25|501}}, October 1, 1888.</ref> The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 [[Pullman Strike]], issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a [[United States district court|federal court]] [[injunction]] backed by federal troops.\n\n[[File:Railroad Coupling (CMRR).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Janney coupler|Automatic couplers]] were required by the 1893 [[Railroad Safety Appliance Act|Safety Appliance Act]].]]\nCongress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the [[Erdman Act]], passed in 1898.<ref>Erdman Act of 1898, June 1, 1898, ch. 370, {{USStat|30|424}}.</ref> This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited \"yellow dog\" contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used.

The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the Telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. For highly efficient Northern railroads played a major role in winning the Civil War, while the overburdened Southern lines collapsed in the face of an insurmountable challenge.<ref>John E.

The famous Erie canal, 300 miles long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts.   A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers cost about the same as one mile of track.\n\nIn 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).<ref>Edward C.

However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route.  Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. The larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres.<ref>Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age''  (1961) pp 57\u201368.</ref> The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market.

Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler and Stephen Salsbury. \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\" in Bruce Mazlish, ed., ''The Railroad and the Space Program'' (MIT Press, 1965)  pp 127\u201362</ref>\n\nAfter a serious accident, the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers to keep track of all train movements. Discipline was essential\u2014everyone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow.<ref>Chandler and Salsbury, \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\"  pp 130\u201334</ref> As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations.  The [[Erie Railroad]], faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]\u2014the largest in the world\u2014was making further advances in using bureaucracy under [[John Edgar Thomson]], president 1852\u20131874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., \"The Railroads: Pioneers in Modern Corporate Management\". ''Business History Review'' 1965 39(1): 16\u201340. {{JSTOR|3112463}}.</ref>\n\n=== Career paths===\nThe fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up to the engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57.  Women were not hired.<ref>Walter Licht, ''working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983) p 289</ref>\n\nWhite-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.  At each level, they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care.  Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by the foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be.<ref>Licht, ''Working for the Railroad'' pp 262\u201363. 269.</ref>  Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.<ref>Dora L. Costa, \"The evolution of retirement.\" in  Costa, ''The Evolution of Retirement: An American Economic History, 1880\u20131990'' (U of Chicago Press, 1998), pp 6\u201331 [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c6108.pdf online].</ref>\n\n===Early attitudes towards railroads===\nBoosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people would dress in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that:\n:The startling introduction of railroads into this agricultural society provoked a discussion that soon arrived at the enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignify, expand and enrich the nation. They became part of the public celebrations of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism.]] The rhetoric, the form, and the central figures of civic ceremonies changed to accommodate the intrusion of this technology....[Between 1828 and 1869] Americans integrated the railroad into the national economy and enfolded it within the sublime.<ref>{{cite book|author=David E. Nye|title=American Technological Sublime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrdbOJFxWIoC&pg=PR9|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|page=9|isbn=9780262640343}}</ref>\n\nTravel became much easier, cheaper and more common. Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores.  Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering.  Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:\n: with the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine the United States of continental proportions without the railroad.<ref>Gary S. Cross and Rick Szostak, ''Technology and American society: A history'' (2005) p 102.</ref>\n\nThe engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government.<ref>Robert Zussman, ''Mechanics of the middle class: work and politics among American engineers'' (1985).</ref> By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the [[Pennsylvania Station (1910\u20131963)|Pennsylvania Station in New York City]], and the [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington DC]].<ref>Carl W. Condit, \"Cincinnati Passenger Stations Before 1930,\" ''Railroad History'' No. 132 (1975) pp. 5\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/43520516 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAs early as the 1830s, novelists and poets began fretting that the railroads would destroy the rustic attractions of the American landscape. By the 1840s concerns were rising about terrible accidents when speeding trains crashed into helpless wooden carriages.<ref>George H. Douglas, ''All Aboard! The Railroad in American Life'' (1992), chapter 5</ref> By the 1870s, railroads were vilified by Western farmers who absorbed the Granger movement theme that monopolistic carriers controlled too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to impose maximum prices. Local merchants and shippers supported the demand and got some \"Granger Laws\" passed.<ref>George H. Miller, \"Origins of the Iowa Granger Law,\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 40#4 (1954), pp. 657\u2013680 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1895862 in JSTOR]</ref> Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated  in late 19th century political rhetoric.<ref>Douglas, ''All Aboard!''

Railroads throughout the United States allowed quicker, more efficient transport of goods and people that were previously unavailable. Agriculture, animals, soldiers, goods, and natural resources were now able to move large distances in much shorter amounts of time. As a result, things that were not harvested before like certain tracts of arable land or animal populations were now being used.\n\n=== Galena and Chicago Union Railroad ===\n[[File:Illinois_regions_map.png|thumb|324x324px|A current map showing Chicago, Galena, Springfield,and St. Louis.]]\n[[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad|The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] was the first railway to be built from [[Chicago]]. It never reached Galena, Illinois, but it reached Clinton, Iowa, and Freeport, Illinois. This railroad marked the beginning of Chicago's economic dominance in the Midwest  though transportation of goods such as agriculture and bison hides. Railroads affected the American environment by opening up unexplored, immense tracts of the American wilderness for settlement commercialization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schivelbusch|first=Wolfgang|date=2014|title=The American Railroad|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\nThe idea behind a railroad to Chicago was to steal Midwestern agricultural business from [[St. Louis]], Missouri and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin. The area around Chicago was ideal for a railroad because it was flat and grassy. Citizens of Chicago believed they could use their environment for commercial gain by actually buying goods grown from the land as well as increasing the value the value of adjacent land neighboring the railroad. The Galena and Chicago Union railroad underwent construction in March 1848 to have the railroad run through Chicago, a booming Midwest town. In order to fund this, local Illinoisans pledged together to build a railway because of the potential economic prosperity. William Cronon writes, \u201dBy the following April [1849], over twelve hundred people had pledged to buy stock hypothetically valued at about $350,000, though they had paid only about $20,000 in actual cash.\u201d Farmers were enamored with the idea of a railroad because transporting crops and goods became much easier and more effective than traveling on dirt roads that could easily become muddy or impassable, so they pledged a lot of their money towards the venture. The process of local funding was stock installments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Nature's Metropolis|last=Cronon|first=William|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=1991|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nBy 1852, the Galena and Chicago Union railroad supplied Chicago over half of its wheat. This statistic changed the way people thought about the environment and its railways because railways through the countryside provided Chicagoans with increased wealth; railways became a symbol of mastery over land by being able to transport anything across terrain. This mastery coupled with an aligning of railroads with prosperity and wealth changed the way Chicagoans saw railways. It was a beacon of hope and deliverer of goods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Impact on buffalo population ==\n[[File:\"Rath & Wright's buffalo hide yard in 1878, showing 40,000 buffalo hides, Dodge City, Kansas.\" - NARA - 520093.tif|thumb|323x323px|A buffalo hide yard in Dodge City, Kansas, in 1878.]]\n[[File:William_Temple_Hornaday.jpeg|thumb|236x236px|Willam Hornaday, a leading conservationist of the 19th century.]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, herds of [[American bison|buffalo]] were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4\u20136 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and graze the same land as the bison. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], an influential zoologist and student of the American bison, wrote, \"as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began.\" Railroads gave rise to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hide, meat, and bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could not consume all of the carcasses that were left behind by hunters. There were so many rotting, pungent, bison corpses that nature's scavengers did not have enough power to consume.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Railroaded|last=White|first=Richard|publisher=W.W.

He describes the pristine wilderness \"long before the white man and long before the wheel\" and before pioneers started to build mines, mills, and factories in the verdant land. Because of the optimism for wealth and adventure, Lightfoot claims, \"The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring.\" He also describes the cost this industry had on nature by penning the line, \"Open her heart let the life blood flow.\" He describes nature's heart as being bled by the workers' dreams, which could not be stopped, \"Into the muskeg and into the rain.\" Because man wants to be in control of nature and conquer it, he wants to be able to say,\n\n\"On the mountain tops we stand\n\nAll the world at our command\n\nWe have opened up the soil\n\nWith our teardrops and our toil\"\n\nThrough hard work technology, pioneers and businessmen adapted the environment for their own commercial needs and quest for power.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian Railway Trilogy|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Gordon|work=The Way I Feel}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThere is no question about the importance of railroads in American history.  Churella finds that back in the 1950s business and economic historians, led by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] and [[Robert Fogel]], made railroads the centerpiece of advanced historiography.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven E. Woodworth|title=The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rb3ANWoZt1YC&pg=PA567|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|page=567|isbn=9780313290190}}</ref>  That era has passed as graduate programs have faded away, courses on railroad history do not make the curriculum, and the historiography has shifted away from professional historian to the \"railfans\"\u2014very well informed amateur writers fascinated by the memorabilia, technology and locomotives of the steam era. Looking at the voluminous output of railfan authors, Klein says:\n\n:The vast bulk of this work is devoted to minute descriptions of power, rolling stock, obscure short lines, and technical subjects....  But few address the larger questions of railroad history or place their topic in broader contexts.<ref>Maury Klein, ''Unfinished Business: The Railroad in American Life'' (1994) p. 169</ref><ref>Albert J. Churella, \"Company, State, and Region: Three Approaches to Railroad History,\" ''Enterprise & Society,'' (2006) 7#3, pp. 581\u2013591</ref>\n\nThe result is a multiplicity of histories of specific railroads, large and small. Typically they deal with standard topics: the builders and their organizational, legislative and financial dealings; colorful construction crews laying down wood ties and steel rail; the development of locomotives and passenger cars; boosters who sought a stop in their little town else it would die; the 1880\u20131920 golden age of the passenger long-distance travel and local excursions; the steady erosion of passenger service during the automobile age; the freight agent and the small-town depot. They end with the more recent saga of retrenchment, merger, and abandonment.<ref name=\"Churella pp. 581-591\">Churella, \"Company, State, and Region: Three Approaches to Railroad History,\" pp. 581\u2013591</ref><ref>Wallace Farnham, \"Railroads in Western History: The View from the Union Pacific,\" ''University of Wyoming Publications'' (1966), Vol. 32, pp. 95\u2013112</ref> Klein, Churella, Roth, and Franham all find that the popular writers show little interest in the development of managerial and organizational complexity of the sort that Chandler studied, or the economic impact that concerned Fogel's cohort.<ref>Marty Roth, \"Review\" of \"Minneapolis and the Age of Railways,\" ''Pioneer America Society Transactions'' (2009) vol 32 pp 185\u20136 [http://www.pioneeramerica.org/currentpast/past2009contents.html online]</ref> From outside the field of railroad history, academic labor historians now deal with the culture of the workers, strikes, the careers for blue collar and white collar men, and racial discrimination.
