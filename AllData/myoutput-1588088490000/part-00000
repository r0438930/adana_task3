The Julian calendar is still used in parts of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and in parts of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] as well as by the [[Berbers]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/africa/2018/01/12/berbers-mark-new-year-in-algeria-welcoming-2968 |title=Berbers mark New Year in Algeria, welcoming 2968 |date=12 January 2018 |access-date=25 June 2019 |quote=The Berber calendar is an agrarian system, based around the seasons and agricultural work, that was inspired by the Julian calendar.}}</ref>\n\nThe Julian calendar has two types of [[year]]: a normal year of 365 days and a leap year of 366 days. They follow a simple cycle of three normal years and one leap year, giving an average year that is 365.25 days long. That is more than the actual [[solar year]] value of 365.24219 days, which means the Julian calendar gains a day every 128 years.\n\nDuring the 20th and 21st centuries, a date according to the Julian calendar is 13 days earlier than its corresponding Gregorian date.\n\n==Table of months==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

In addition, a 27- or 28-day [[intercalary month]], the [[Mercedonius|Mensis Intercalaris]], was sometimes inserted between February and March. This intercalary month was formed by inserting 22 or 23 days after the first 23 days of February; the last five days of February, which counted down toward the start of March, became the last five days of Intercalaris. The net effect was to add 22 or 23 days to the year, forming an intercalary year of 377 or 378 days.<ref>T H Key, \"A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities\" (article ''Calendarium''), London, 1875, available at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html].</ref> Some say the ''mensis intercalaris'' always had 27 days and began on either the first or the second day after the Terminalia (23 February).<ref>Blackburn, B & Holford-Strevens, L ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 1999, reprinted with corrections, 2003, pp. 669\u201370.</ref>\n\nAccording to the later writers [[Censorinus]] and [[Macrobius]], the ideal intercalary cycle consisted of ordinary years of 355 days alternating with intercalary years, alternately 377 and 378 days long. In this system, the average Roman year would have had {{frac|366|1|4}} days over four years, giving it an average drift of one day per year relative to any [[solstice]] or equinox. Macrobius describes a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, there were only three intercalary years, each of 377 days (thus 11 intercalary years out of 24). This refinement averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.\n\nIn practice, intercalations did not occur systematically according to any of these ideal systems, but were determined by the [[Pontifex Maximus|pontifices]]. So far as can be determined from the historical evidence, they were much less regular than these ideal schemes suggest. They usually occurred every second or third year, but were sometimes omitted for much longer, and occasionally occurred in two consecutive years.\n\nIf managed correctly this system could have allowed the Roman year to stay roughly aligned to a tropical year. However, since the pontifices were often politicians, and because a Roman magistrate's term of [[official|office]] corresponded with a calendar year, this power was prone to abuse: a pontifex could lengthen a year in which he or one of his political allies was in office, or refuse to lengthen one in which his opponents were in power.<ref>Censorinus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#20.7 ''De die natali'' 20.7] (Latin)</ref>\n\nIf too many intercalations were omitted, as happened after the [[Second Punic War]] and during the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]], the calendar would drift out of alignment with the tropical year. Moreover, because intercalations were often determined quite late, the average Roman citizen often did not know the date, particularly if he were some distance from the city. For these reasons, the last years of the pre-Julian calendar were later known as \"years of confusion\". The problems became particularly acute during the years of Julius Caesar's pontificate before the reform, 63\u201346&nbsp;BC, when there were only five intercalary months (instead of eight), none of which were during the five Roman years before 46&nbsp;BC.\n\nCaesar's reform was intended to solve this problem permanently, by creating a calendar that remained aligned to the sun without any human intervention. This proved useful very soon after the new calendar came into effect. [[Varro]] used it in 37&nbsp;BC to fix calendar dates for the start of the four seasons, which would have been impossible only 8 years earlier.<ref name=\"Varro\">Varro, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/1*.html#28 ''On Agriculture'' I.1.28.]</ref> A century later, when [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] dated the [[winter solstice]] to 25 December because the sun entered the 8th degree of Capricorn on that date,<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History:'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D18%3Achapter%3D59 ''(Book 18, LIX / LXVI / LXVIII / LXXIV)''.]</ref> this stability had become an ordinary fact of life.\n\n=== Context of the reform ===\nAlthough the approximation of {{frac|365|1|4}} days for the tropical year had been known for a long time<ref>{{cite journal|first=R.

The length of nineteen years in the [[Metonic cycle|cycle of Meton]] was 6,940 days, six hours longer than the mean Julian year. The mean Julian year was the basis of the [[Callippic cycle|76-year cycle]] devised by [[Callippus]] (a student under Eudoxus) to improve the Metonic cycle.\n\nIn Persia (Iran) after the reform in the [[Iranian calendars#Old Persian calendar|Persian calendar]] by introduction of the Persian Zoroastrian (i. e. Young Avestan) calendar in 503&nbsp;BC and afterwards, the first day of the year (1 Farvardin=[[Nowruz]]) slipped against the vernal equinox at the rate of approximately one day every four years.<ref>Hartner, Willy. \"The young Avestan and Babylonian calendars and the antecedents of precession.\" Journal for the History of Astronomy 10 (1979): 1. pp.&nbsp;1\u201322.

Oxford University Press, 2012., p. 178.</ref>\n\nLikewise in the [[Egyptian calendar]], a fixed year of 365 days was in use, drifting by one day against the sun in four years. An unsuccessful attempt to add an extra day every fourth year was made in 238&nbsp;BC ([[Decree of Canopus]]). Caesar probably experienced this \"wandering\" or \"vague\" calendar in that country. He landed in the Nile delta in October 48&nbsp;BC and soon became embroiled in the Ptolemaic dynastic war, especially after [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] managed to be \"introduced\" to him in [[Alexandria]].\n\nCaesar imposed a peace, and a banquet was held to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Book 10\">Lucan, ''[[Pharsalia]]:'' [http://mcllibrary.org/Pharsalia/book10.html ''Book 10''.]</ref> [[Lucan]] depicted Caesar talking to a wise man called [[Acoreus]] during the feast, stating his intention to create a calendar more perfect than that of Eudoxus<ref name=\"Book 10\" /> (Eudoxus was popularly credited with having determined the length of the year to be {{frac|365|1|4}} days).<ref>\u00c9mile Bi\u00e9mont, ''Rythmes du temps, astronomie et calendriers'', \u00e9d.

According to Macrobius, Caesar was assisted in this by a certain Marcus Flavius.<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.2 ''Saturnalia'' I.14.2] (Latin).</ref>\n\n=== Adoption of the Julian calendar ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2013}}\nCaesar's reform only applied to the [[Roman calendar]]. However, in the following decades many of the local civic and provincial calendars of the empire and neighbouring client kingdoms were aligned to the Julian calendar by transforming them into calendars with years of 365 days with an extra day intercalated every four years.<ref>This section is based on S. Stern, ''Calendars in Antiquity'' (OUP 2012) pp. 259\u2013297.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Calendars_in_Antiquity.html?id=tiMZAI4oS-MC&source=kp_book_description|title=Calendars in Antiquity: Empires, States, and Societies|last=Stern|first=Sacha|date=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958944-9|location=|pages=259\u2013297|language=en}}</ref> The reformed calendars typically retained many features of the unreformed calendars. In many cases, the New Year was not on 1 January, the leap day was not on the bissextile day, the old month names were retained, the lengths of the reformed months did not match the lengths of Julian months, and, even if they did, their first days did not match the first day of the corresponding Julian month. Nevertheless, since the reformed calendars had fixed relationships to each other and to the Julian calendar, the process of converting dates between them became quite straightforward, through the use of conversion tables known as ''hemerologia''.<ref>Studied in detail in W. Kubitschek, ''Die Kalendarb\u00fccher von Florenz, Rom und Leyden'' (Vienna, 1915).</ref> Several of the reformed calendars are only known through surviving hemerologia.\n\nThe three most important of these calendars are the [[Coptic calendar|Alexandrian calendar]], the [[Asian calendar]] and the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Syro-Macedonian]] calendar. Other reformed calendars are known from Cappadocia, Cyprus and the cities of Syria and Palestine. Most reformed calendars were adopted under Augustus, though the calendar of [[Nabatea]] was reformed after the kingdom became the Roman province of Arabia in AD 106. There is no evidence that local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar in the western empire. Unreformed calendars continued to be used in [[Coligny calendar|Gaul]], Greece, Macedon, the Balkans and parts of Palestine, most notably in Judea.\n\nThe Alexandrian calendar adapted the Egyptian calendar by adding a 6th epagomenal day as the last day of the year in every fourth year, falling on 29 August preceding a Julian bissextile day. It was otherwise identical to the Egyptian calendar. The first leap day was in 22&nbsp;BC, and they occurred every four years from the beginning, even though Roman leap days occurred every three years at this time (see [[Julian calendar#Leap year error|Leap year error]]). This calendar influenced the structure of several other reformed calendars, such as those of the cities of Gaza and Ascalon in Palestine, Salamis in Cyprus, and the province of Arabia. It was adopted by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic church]] and remains in use both as the liturgical calendar of the Coptic church and as the civil calendar of [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe Asian calendar was an adaptation of the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Macedonian calendar]] used in the province of Asia and, with minor variations, in nearby cities and provinces. It is known in detail through the survival of decrees promulgating it issued in 8 BC by the proconsul [[Paullus Fabius Maximus]]. It renamed the first month Dios as ''Kaisar'', and arranged the months such that each month started on the ninth day before the kalends of the corresponding Roman month; thus the year began on 23 September, Augustus' birthday. Since Greek months typically had 29 or 30 days, the extra day of 31-day months was named ''Sebaste''\u2014the emperor's day\u2014and was the first day of these months. The leap day was a second Sebaste day in the month of Xandikos, i.e., 24 February. This calendar remained in use at least until the middle of the fifth century AD.\n\nThe Syro-Macedonian calendar was an adaptation of the Macedonian calendar used in Antioch and other parts of Syria. The months were exactly aligned to the Julian calendar, but they retained their Macedonian names and the year began in Dios = November until the fifth century, when the start of the year was moved to Gorpiaios = September.\n\nThese reformed calendars generally remained in use until the fifth or sixth century. Around that time most of them were replaced as civil calendars by the Julian calendar, but with a year starting in September to reflect the year of the [[indiction]] cycle.\n\nThe Julian calendar spread beyond the borders of the Roman Empire through its use as the Christian liturgical calendar. When a people or a country was converted to Christianity, they generally also adopted the Christian calendar of the church responsible for conversion. Thus, Christian Nubia and Ethiopia adopted the Alexandrian calendar, while Christian Europe adopted the Julian calendar, in either the Catholic or Orthodox variant. Starting in the 16th century, European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere likewise inherited the Julian calendar of the mother country, until they adopted the Gregorian reform. The last country to adopt the Julian calendar was the Ottoman Empire, which used it for financial purposes for some time under the name [[Rumi calendar]] and dropped the \"escape years\" which tied it to Muslim chronology in 1840.\n\n== Julian reform ==\n\n=== Realignment of the year ===\nThe first step of the reform was to realign the start of the calendar year (1 January) to the tropical year by making 46&nbsp;BC (708 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]]) 445 days long, compensating for the intercalations which had been missed during Caesar's pontificate. This year had already been extended from 355 to 378 days by the insertion of a regular [[intercalary month]] in February. When Caesar decreed the reform, probably shortly after his return from the [[Battle of Thapsus|African campaign]] in late Quintilis (July), he added 67 more days by inserting two extraordinary intercalary months between November and December.<ref group=\"note\">It is not known why he decided that 67 was the correct number of days to add, nor whether he intended to align the calendar to a specific astronomical event such as the winter solstice. [[Ideler]] suggested (''Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie'' II 123\u2013125) that he intended to align the winter solstice to a supposedly traditional date of 25 December. The number may compensate for three omitted intercalary months (67 = 22+23+22). It also made the distance from 1 March 46&nbsp;BC, the original New Years Day in the Roman calendar, to 1 January 45&nbsp;BC 365 days.</ref>\n\nThese months are called ''Intercalaris Prior'' and ''Intercalaris Posterior'' in letters of [[Cicero]] written at the time; there is no basis for the statement sometimes seen that they were called \"[[Undecimber]]\" and \"[[Duodecember|Duodecimber]]\", terms that arose in the 18th century over a millennium after the Roman Empire's collapse.<ref group=\"note\">E.g., \"... we have a sidelight on what was involved in \"the year of confusion\" as it was called. According to Dion Cassius, the historian, there was a governor in Gaul who insisted that, in the lengthened year, two months' extra taxes should be paid. The extra months were called Undecimber and Duodecimber.\" (P. W. Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9xcbAAAAYAAJ&q=undecimber+duodecimber ''The romance of the calendar''] (New York, 1937), 112). The eponymous dating of the cited passage ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#21 Dio Cassius 54.21]) shows that it actually refers to an event of 15&nbsp;BC, not 46&nbsp;BC.</ref> Their individual lengths are unknown, as is the position of the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] and [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] within them.<ref>J. R\u00fcpke, ''The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History and the Fasti'', 117f., suggests, based on the ritual structures of the calendar, that 5 days were added to November and that the two intercalary months each had 31 days, with Nones and Ides on the 7th and 15th.</ref>\n\nBecause 46&nbsp;BC was the last of a series of irregular years, this extra-long year was, and is, referred to as the \"last year of confusion\". The new calendar began operation after the realignment had been completed, in 45&nbsp;BC.<ref>[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]:'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html#p231 Year of Julius Caesar]), following [[Ideler]], interprets Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.13 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.13] (Latin) to mean that Caesar decreed that the first day of the new calendar began with the new moon which fell on the night of 1/2 January 45&nbsp;BC. (The new moon was on 2 January 45&nbsp;BC (in the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]]) at 00:21 UTC, according to [[Institut de m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste et de calcul des \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e9rides|IMCCE]] (a branch of the [[Paris Observatory]]): [http://bugle.imcce.fr/en/grandpublic/phenomenes/phases_lune/index.php ''Phases of the moon (between \u22124000 and +2500)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720232543/http://bugle.imcce.fr/en/grandpublic/phenomenes/phases_lune/index.php |date=2011-07-20 }}.) However, more recent studies of the manuscripts have shown that the word on which this is based, which was read as ''lunam'', should be read as ''linam'', meaning that Macrobius was simply stating that Caesar published an edict giving the revised calendar \u2013 see e.g., p.99 in the translation of Macrobius by P. Davies. Smith gives no source or justification for his other speculation that Caesar originally intended to commence the year precisely with the winter solstice.</ref>\n\n=== Months ===\n\nThe Julian months were formed by adding ten days to a regular pre-Julian Roman year of 355 days, creating a regular Julian year of 365 days. Two extra days were added to January, Sextilis (August) and December, and one extra day was added to April, June, September and November. February was not changed in ordinary years, and so continued to be the traditional 28 days. Thus, the ordinary (i.e., non-leap year) lengths of all of the months were set by the Julian calendar to the same values they still hold today. (See [[#Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths|Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths (below)]]  for stories purporting otherwise.)\n\nThe Julian reform did not change [[Roman calendar#Months|the method used to account days of the month in the pre-Julian calendar]], based on the Kalends, Nones and Ides, nor did it change the positions of these three dates within the months. Macrobius states that the extra days were added immediately before the last day of each month to avoid disturbing the position of the established religious ceremonies relative to the Nones and Ides of the month.<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.9 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.9] (Latin). Exceptionally, the extra day in April was inserted as the 26th, a.d. VI Kal. Mai. in the Julian calendar, in order to avoid adding a day to the [[Floralia]], which ran from a.d. IV Kal. Mai. (27 April in the pre-Julian calendar) to a.d. V Non. Mai.</ref> However, since Roman dates after the Ides of the month counted down toward the start of the next month, the extra days had the effect of raising the initial value of the count of the day following the Ides in the lengthened months. Thus, in January, Sextilis and December the 14th day of the month became a.d. XIX Kal. instead of a.d. XVII Kal., while in April, June, September and November it became a.d. XVIII Kal.\n\nRomans of the time born after the Ides of a month responded differently to the effect of this change on their birthdays. [[Mark Antony]] kept his birthday on 14 January, which changed its date from a.d. XVII Kal. Feb to a.d. XIX Kal. Feb, a date that had previously not existed. [[Livia]] kept the date of her birthday unchanged at a.d. III Kal. Feb., which moved it from 28 to 30 January, a day that had previously not existed. [[Augustus]] kept his on 23 September, but both the old date (a.d. VIII Kal. Oct.) and the new (a.d. IX Kal. Oct.) were celebrated in some places.\n\nThe inserted days were all initially characterised as ''dies fasti'' ('''F''' \u2013 see [[Roman calendar#Character of the day|Roman calendar]]).<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.12 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.12] (Latin).</ref> The character of a few festival days was changed. In the early Julio-Claudian period a large number of festivals were decreed to celebrate events of dynastic importance, which caused the character of the associated dates to be changed to '''NP'''. However, this practice was discontinued around the reign of [[Claudius]], and the practice of characterising days fell into disuse around the end of the first century AD: the Antonine jurist [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] speaks of ''dies nefasti'' as a thing of the past.<ref>A. K. Michels, ''The Calendar of the Roman Republic'' Appendix II; J. R\u00fcpke, ''The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine'' 113\u2013114, 126\u2013132, 147.</ref>\n\n=== Intercalation ===\nThe old intercalary month was abolished. The new leap day was dated as ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias'' ('the sixth doubled day before the Kalends of March'), usually abbreviated as ''a.d. bis VI Kal. Mart.''; hence it is called in English the [[bissextile]] day. The year in which it occurred was termed ''annus bissextus'', in English the bissextile year.\n\nThere is debate about the exact position of the bissextile day in the early Julian calendar. The earliest direct evidence is a statement of the 2nd century jurist [[Publius Iuventius Celsus|Celsus]], who states that there were two halves of a 48-hour day, and that the intercalated day was the \"posterior\" half. An inscription from AD 168 states that ''a.d. V Kal. Mart.'' was the day after the bissextile day. The 19th century chronologist [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] argued that Celsus used the term \"posterior\" in a technical fashion to refer to the earlier of the two days, which requires the inscription to refer to the whole 48-hour day as the bissextile. Some later historians share this view. Others, following [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], take the view that Celsus was using the ordinary Latin (and English) meaning of \"posterior\". A third view is that neither half of the 48-hour \"bis sextum\" was originally formally designated as intercalated, but that the need to do so arose as the concept of a 48-hour day became obsolete.<ref>W. Sternkopf, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=MmPMaTG2ukYC&pg=PA718 Das Bissextum]\", (JCP 41 (1895) 718\u2013733).</ref>\n\nThere is no doubt that the bissextile day eventually became the earlier of the two days for most purposes. In 238 Censorinus stated that it was inserted after the [[Terminus (god)|Terminalia]] (23 February) and was followed by the last five days of February, i.e., a.d. VI, V, IV, III and prid. Kal. Mart. (which would be 24 to 28 February in a common year and the 25th to 29th in a leap year). Hence he regarded the bissextum as the first half of the doubled day. All later writers, including Macrobius about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter) followed this rule, as does the [[liturgical year|liturgical calendar]] of the Roman Catholic Church. However, Celsus' definition continued to be used for legal purposes. It was incorporated into [[Digest (Roman law)|Justinian's Digest]],<ref>Justinian, [http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Anglica/D50_Scott.htm#XVI Digest 50.16.98].</ref> and in the English statute ''De anno et die bissextili'' of 1236,<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKZFAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA20 |chapter=The statute ''De anno et die bissextili'', made at Westminster, Anno 21 Hen.

According to Dio Cassius, a leap day was inserted in 41&nbsp;BC to ensure that the first market day of 40&nbsp;BC did not fall on 1 January, which implies that the old 8-day cycle was not immediately affected by the Julian reform. However, he also reports that in AD 44, and on some previous occasions, the market day was changed to avoid a conflict with a religious festival. This may indicate that a single nundinal letter was assigned to both halves of the 48-hour bissextile day by this time, so that the [[Regifugium]] and the market day might fall on the same date but on different days. In any case, the 8-day nundinal cycle began to be displaced by the 7-day [[Seven-day week|week]] in the first century AD, and [[dominical letter]]s began to appear alongside nundinal letters in the fasti.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#33.4 Dio Cassius 48.33.4], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#24.7 60.24.7]; C.

Consequently, the leap day was considered to be the last day in February in leap years, i.e., 29 February, which is its current position.\n\n=== Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths ===\nThe Julian reform set the lengths of the months to their modern values. However, a 13th-century scholar, [[Sacrobosco]], proposed a different explanation for the lengths of Julian months<ref>Roscoe Lamont, \"[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1919PA.....27..579P/0000583.000.html The Roman calendar and its reformation by Julius Caesar]\", ''[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]'' '''27''' (1919) 583\u2013595. Sacrobosco's theory is discussed on pages 585\u2013587.</ref> which is still widely repeated but is certainly wrong.\n\nAccording to Sacrobosco, the month lengths for ordinary years in the Roman Republican calendar, from January to December, were:\n\n:30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29.\n\nSacrobosco then thought that Julius Caesar added one day to every month except February, a total of 11 more days to regular months, giving the ordinary Julian year of 365 days. A single leap day could now be added to this extra short February:\n\n:31, 29/30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30.\n\nHe then said Augustus changed this, by taking one day from February to add it to Sextilis, and then modifying the alternation of the following months, to:\n\n:31, 28/29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31\n\nso that the length of ''Augustus'' (August) would not be shorter than (and therefore inferior to) the length of ''Iulius'' (July), giving us the irregular month lengths which are still in use.\n\nThere is abundant evidence disproving this theory. First, a wall painting of a Roman calendar predating the Julian reform has survived,<ref>{{citation |last=Grout |first=James |title=Fasti Antiates |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/calendar/antiates.html |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu}}</ref><ref>[[:c:File:Museo del Teatro Romano de Caesaraugusta.43.jpg|Reproduction of pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. Month lengths at bottom.</ref> which confirms the literary accounts that the months were already irregular before Julius Caesar reformed them, with an ordinary year of 355 days, not 354, with month lengths arranged as:\n\n:29, 28, 31, 29, 31, 29, 31, 29, 29, 31, 29, 29.\n\nAlso, the Julian reform did not change the dates of the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] and [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]]. In particular, the Ides were late (on the 15th rather than 13th) in March, May, July and October, showing that these months always had 31 days in the Roman calendar,<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#13.7 ''Saturnalia'' 1.13.7] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.7 1.14.7\u20138] (Latin), Censorinus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#20.10 ''De die natali'' 20.10] (Latin), [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Maude/Censorinus/DeDieNatale-Part2.html#chap9 (English)].</ref> whereas Sacrobosco's theory requires that March, May and July were originally 30 days long and that the length of October was changed from 29 to 30 days by Caesar and to 31 days by Augustus. Further, Sacrobosco's theory is explicitly contradicted by the 3rd and 5th century authors Censorinus<ref>Censorinus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#20.9 ''De die natali'' 20.9] (Latin), [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Maude/Censorinus/DeDieNatale-Part2.html#chap9 (English)]</ref> and Macrobius,<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.7 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.7] (Latin)</ref> and it is inconsistent with seasonal lengths given by Varro, writing in 37&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"Varro\" /> before Sextilis was [[Julian calendar#Month names|renamed]] for Augustus in 8&nbsp;BC, with the 31-day Sextilis given by an Egyptian papyrus from 24&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"papyrus\" /> and with the 28-day February shown in the ''Fasti Caeretani'', which is dated before 12&nbsp;BC.<ref>A.

There is a simple cycle of three \"normal\" years followed by a leap year and this pattern repeats forever without exception. The Julian year is, therefore, on average 365.25 days long. Consequently, the Julian year drifts over time with respect to the [[tropical year|tropical (solar) year]] (365.24217 days).<ref name=\"Richards\">Using value from Richards (2013, p. 587) for tropical year in mean solar days, the calculation is {{nowrap|1/(365.2425-365.24217)}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Greek astronomers had known, at least since [[Hipparchus]],<ref name=\":0\">[[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]], tr. [[G. J. Toomer]], ''[[Almagest|Ptolemy's Almagest]]'', 1998, Princeton University Press, p. 139.

As a result, the calendar year gains about three days every four centuries compared to observed [[equinox]] times and the seasons. This discrepancy was largely corrected by the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] of 1582. The Gregorian calendar has the same months and month lengths as the Julian calendar, but, in the Gregorian calendar, year numbers evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, except that those evenly divisible by 400 remain leap years.<ref name=\":1\">[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars].

The accumulated effect of this difference over some 1600 years since the basis for [[Computus|calculation of the date of Easter]] was [[First Council of Nicea#Separation of Easter computation from Jewish calendar|determined at the First Council of Nicea]] means for example that, from 29 February ''Julian'' (13 March ''Gregorian'') 1900 and until 28 February ''Julian'' (13 March ''Gregorian'') 2100, the ''Julian'' calendar is 13 days behind the ''Gregorian'' calendar; one day after (i.e. on 29 February ''Julian'' or 14 March ''Gregorian''), the difference will be 14 days.\n\n== Leap year error ==\n<!-- Linked from Roman calendar: Later reforms -->\nAlthough the new calendar was much simpler than the pre-Julian calendar, the pontifices initially added a leap day every three years, instead of every four.

But when this error was at length recognised, it too was corrected, by an order of Augustus, that twelve years should be allowed to pass without an intercalary day, since the sequence of twelve such years would account for the three days which, in the course of thirty-six years, had been introduced by the premature actions of the priests.}}\nSo, according to Macrobius,\n# the year was considered to begin after the Terminalia, (23 February)<ref>Marcus Terentius Varro, ''On the Latin Language'', 6.13, tr.

Thus Xanthicus began on a.d. IX Kal. Mart., and normally contained 31 days. In leap year, however, it contained an extra \"Sebaste day\", the Roman leap day, and thus had 32 days.

But since the corresponding Roman date in the inscription is 24 January, this must be according to the incorrect calendar which in 8&nbsp;BC Augustus had ordered to be corrected by the omission of leap days. As the authors of the previous{{which|date=October 2019}} paper point out, with the correct four-year cycle being used in Egypt and the three-year cycle abolished in Rome, it is unlikely that Augustus would have ordered the three-year cycle to be introduced in Asia.\n\n==Month names==\nThe Julian reform did not immediately cause the names of any months to be changed. The old [[Mercedonius|intercalary month]] was abolished and replaced with a single intercalary day at the same point (i.e., five days before the end of February). January continued to be the first month of the year.\n\nThe Romans later renamed months after Julius Caesar and Augustus, renaming Quintilis as \"Iulius\" (July)<ref name=J /> in 44&nbsp;BC and Sextilis as \"Augustus\" (August) in 8&nbsp;BC. Quintilis was renamed to honour Caesar because it was the month of his birth.<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#76 ''Caesar''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530163202/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#76 |date=2012-05-30 }} 76.1.</ref> According to a ''[[senatus consultum]]'' quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honour Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, occurred in that month.<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#31.2 ''Augustus'' 31.2]; Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12.35  ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.35] (Latin)</ref>\n\nOther months were renamed by other emperors, but apparently none of the later changes survived their deaths.

According to his biographer, Charlemagne renamed all of the months agriculturally into German.<ref>Einhard, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.asp#Reforms ''Life of Charlemagne'', 29].</ref> These names were used until the 15th century, over 700 years after his rule, and continued, with some modifications, to see some use as \"traditional\" month names until the late 18th century. The names (January to December) were: ''Wintarmanoth'' (\"winter month\"), ''Hornung'',<ref group=note>This name of February, the only name in the list without the \"month\" suffix, is explained by K\u00f6nig, ''Festschrift Bergmann'' (1997), pp. 425 ff. as a collective of ''[[:wikt:horn|horn]]'', taken to refer to the antlers shed by [[red deer]] during this time. Older explanations compare the name with Old Frisian ''horning'' (Anglo-Saxon ''hornung-sunu'', Old Norse ''hornungr'') meaning \"bastard, illegitimate son\", taken to imply a meaning of \"disinherited\" in reference to February being the shortest of months.</ref> ''Lentzinmanoth'' (\"spring month\", \"[[:wikt:Lent|Lent]] month\"), ''Ostarmanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:Easter|Easter]] month\"), ''Wonnemanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/wunj\u014d|joy]]-month\", a corruption of ''Winnimanoth'' \"pasture-month\"), ''Brachmanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:Brache|fallow]]-month\"), ''Heuuimanoth'' (\"hay month\"), ''Aranmanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:earnian|reaping]] month\"), ''Witumanoth'' (\"wood month\"), ''Windumemanoth'' (\"vintage month\"), ''Herbistmanoth'' (\"harvest month\"), and ''Heilagmanoth'' (\"holy month\").\n\nThe calendar month names used in western and northern Europe, in Byzantium, and by the [[Berber calendar#The months|Berbers]], were derived from the Latin names. However, in eastern Europe older seasonal month names continued to be used into the 19th century, and in some cases are still in use, in many languages, including: [[Belarusian months|Belarusian]], [[Bulgarian months|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian months|Croatian]], [[Czech months|Czech]], Finnish,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordinfo.info/unit/3236/ip:23 |title=Calendar, Finnish |website=English-Word Information}}</ref> [[Georgian calendar|Georgian]], [[Lithuanian calendar#Names of the months|Lithuanian]], [[Macedonian months|Macedonian]], [[Polish months|Polish]], [[Romanian months|Romanian]], [[Slovene months|Slovene]], [[Ukrainian months|Ukrainian]]. When the Ottoman Empire adopted the Julian calendar, in the form of the Rumi calendar, the [[Rumi calendar#History|month names]] reflected Ottoman tradition.\n\n== Year numbering ==\nThe principal method used by the Romans to identify a year for dating purposes was to name it after the two consuls who took office in it, the eponymous period in question being the consular year. Beginning in 153&nbsp;BC, consuls began to take office on 1 January, thus synchronizing the commencement of the consular and calendar years. The calendar year has begun in January and ended in December since about 450&nbsp;BC according to Ovid or since about 713&nbsp;BC according to Macrobius and Plutarch (see [[Roman calendar]]). Julius Caesar did not change the beginning of either the consular year or the calendar year. In addition to consular years, the Romans sometimes used the regnal year of the emperor, and by the late 4th century documents were also being dated according to the 15-year cycle of the [[indiction]]. In 537, [[Justinian I|Justinian]] required that henceforth the date must include the name of the emperor and his regnal year, in addition to the indiction and the consul, while also allowing the use of local [[Calendar era|eras]].\n\nIn 309 and 310, and from time to time thereafter, no consuls were appointed.<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_08_fasti.htm Chronography of AD 354.]</ref> When this happened, the consular date was given a count of years since the last consul (so-called \"post-consular\" dating). After 541, only the reigning emperor held the consulate, typically for only one year in his reign, and so post-consular dating became the norm. Similar post-consular dates were also known in the west in the early 6th century. <!-- Commented out pending further research. [[User:Dojarca]] is up to 4th year of the consulate of [[Justinian II]] with no assurance he is the latest. --~~~~ The last known post-consular date is year 22 after the consulate of [[Heraclius]].{{Verify source|date=August 2007}} The last emperor to hold the consulate was [[Constans II]]. --> The system of consular dating, long obsolete, was formally abolished in the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]], issued in 888.\n\nOnly rarely did the Romans number the year from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the city (of Rome)]], ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' (AUC). This method was used by Roman historians to determine the number of years from one event to another, not to date a year. Different historians had several different dates for the founding. The ''[[Fasti]] Capitolini'', an inscription containing an official list of the consuls which was published by Augustus, used an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of 752&nbsp;BC. The epoch used by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], 753&nbsp;BC, has been adopted by modern historians. Indeed, [[Renaissance]] editors often added it to the manuscripts that they published, giving the false impression that the Romans numbered their years. Most modern historians tacitly assume that it began on the day the consuls took office, and ancient documents such as the ''Fasti Capitolini'' which use other AUC systems do so in the same way. However, Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century AD, states that, in his time, the AUC year began with the [[Parilia]], celebrated on 21 April, which was regarded as the actual anniversary of the foundation of Rome.<ref>Censorinus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#21.6 ''De die natali'' 21.6] (Latin). Because the festivities associated with the Parilia conflicted with the solemnity of [[Lent]], which was observed until the Saturday before Easter Sunday, the early Roman church did not celebrate Easter after 21 April \u2013 Charles W. Jones, \"Development of the Latin Ecclesiastical calendar\", ''Bedae Opera de Temporibus'' (1943), 1\u2013122, p.28.</ref>\n\nMany local eras, such as the Era of Actium and the [[Spanish Era]], were adopted for the Julian calendar or its local equivalent in the provinces and cities of the Roman Empire. Some of these were used for a considerable time.<ref>For a partial survey see A. E. Samuel, ''Greek and Roman Chronology: calendars and years in classical antiquity'' (Munich, 1972), 245ff. Samuel introduces his survey by saying: \"The number of eras which came into use and then expired to be replaced by yet other eras during Hellenistic and Roman times is probably not infinite, but I have not been able to find the end of them.\" Anatolian eras are exhaustively surveyed in W. Leschhorn, ''Antike \u00c4ren: Zeitrechnung, Politik und Geschichte im Schwarzmeerraum und in Kleinasien n\u00f6rdlich des Tauros'' (Stuttgart, 1993).</ref> Perhaps the best known is the [[Era of Martyrs]], sometimes also called ''Anno Diocletiani'' (after [[Diocletian]]), which was associated with the Alexandrian calendar and often used by the [[Alexandria]]n Christians to number their Easters during the 4th and 5th centuries, and continues to be used by the Coptic and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian]] churches.\n\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, the efforts of Christian chronographers such as [[Annianus of Alexandria]] to date the Biblical creation of the world led to the introduction of [[Anno Mundi]] eras based on this event.<ref>A. A. Mosshammer, ''The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era'' (Oxford, 2008) 27\u201329.</ref> The most important of these was the [[Etos Kosmou]], used throughout the Byzantine world from the 10th century and in Russia until 1700. In the west, the kingdoms succeeding the empire initially used indictions and [[regnal year]]s, alone or in combination. The chronicler [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], in the fifth century, used an era dated from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], but this era was not widely adopted. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] proposed the system of [[Anno Domini]] in 525. This era gradually spread through the western Christian world, once the system was adopted by [[Bede]] in the eighth century.\n\nThe Julian calendar was also used in some Muslim countries. The Rumi calendar, the Julian calendar used in the later years of the [[Ottoman Empire]], adopted an era derived from the lunar [[Islamic calendar|AH]] year equivalent to AD 1840, i.e., the effective Rumi epoch was AD 585. In recent years, some users of the [[Berber calendar#The computation of the years|Berber calendar]] have adopted an era starting in 950&nbsp;BC, the approximate date that the Libyan pharaoh [[Sheshonq I]] came to power in Egypt.\n\n== New Year's Day ==\nThe Roman calendar began the year on 1 January, and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform. However, even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar, they started the new year on different dates. The Alexandrian calendar in Egypt started on 29 August (30 August after an Alexandrian leap year). Several local provincial calendars were aligned to start on the birthday of Augustus, 23 September. The indiction caused the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] year, which used the Julian calendar, to begin on 1 September; this date is still used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] for the beginning of the liturgical year. When the Julian calendar was adopted in AD 988 by [[Vladimir I of Kiev]], the year was numbered Anno Mundi 6496, beginning on 1 March, six months after the start of the Byzantine Anno Mundi year with the same number. In 1492 (AM 7000), [[Ivan III]], according to church tradition, realigned the start of the year to 1 September, so that AM 7000 only lasted for six months in Russia, from 1 March to 31 August 1492.<ref>[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://grigam.narod.ru/kalend/kalen19.htm \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (Calendar history in Russia and in the USSR).]</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages 1 January retained the name ''[[New Year's Day]]'' (or an equivalent name) in all [[western Europe]]an countries (affiliated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]), since the medieval calendar continued to display the months from January to December (in twelve columns containing 28 to 31 days each), just as the Romans had. However, most of those countries began their numbered year on 25 December (the Nativity of [[Jesus]]), 25 March (the [[Annunciation|Incarnation of Jesus]]), or even Easter, as in [[France]] (see the [[Liturgical year]] article for more details).\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, the year most commonly began on 25 December, which, as (approximately) the [[winter solstice]], had marked the start of the year in pagan times, though 25 March (the [[equinox]]) is occasionally documented in the 11th century. Sometimes the start of the year was reckoned as 24 September, the start of the so-called \"western indiction\" introduced by Bede.<ref>M. L. R. Beaven, \"The Regnal Dates of Alfred, Edward the Elder, and Athelstan\", English Historical Review 32 (1917) 517\u2013531; idem, \"The Beginning of the Year in the Alfredian Chronicle (866\u201387)\", English Historical Review 33 (1918) 328\u2013342.</ref> These practices changed after the Norman conquest.

The following table shows the years in which various countries adopted 1 January as the start of the year. Eastern European countries, with populations showing allegiance to the [[orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]], began the year on 1 September from about 988.

Reform was required because too many leap days are added with respect to the astronomical seasons on the Julian scheme. On average, the astronomical solstices and the equinoxes advance by 10.8 minutes per year against the Julian year. As a result, the [[Computus|calculated date]] of Easter gradually moved out of alignment with the March equinox.\n[[File:Julian to Gregorian Date Change.png|thumb|This is a visual example of the official date change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian.]]\nWhile Hipparchus and presumably [[Sosigenes of Alexandria|Sosigenes]] were aware of the discrepancy, although not of its correct value,{{sfn|Richards|1998|page=216}} it was evidently felt to be of little importance at the time of the Julian reform (46 BC). However, it accumulated significantly over time: the Julian calendar gained a day every 128 years. By 1582, it was ten days out of alignment from where it supposedly had been in 325 during the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was soon adopted by most Catholic countries (e.g., Spain, Portugal, Poland, most of Italy). Protestant countries followed later, and some countries of eastern Europe even later. In the British Empire (including the [[United States|American colonies]]), Wednesday {{nowrap|2 September 1752}} was followed by Thursday {{nowrap|14 September 1752}}. For 12 years from 1700 Sweden used a [[Swedish calendar|modified Julian calendar]], and adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1753.\n\nSince the Julian and Gregorian calendars were long used simultaneously, although in different places, calendar dates in the transition period are often ambiguous, unless it is specified which calendar was being used. In some circumstances, double dates might be used, one in each calendar. The notation [[Old Style and New Style dates|\"Old Style\" (O.S.)]] is sometimes used to indicate a date in the Julian calendar, as opposed to [[Old Style and New Style dates|\"New Style\" (N.S.)]], which either represents the Julian date with the start of the year as 1 January or a full mapping onto the Gregorian calendar. This notation is used to clarify dates from countries which continued to use the Julian calendar after the Gregorian reform, such as Great Britain, which did not switch to the reformed calendar until 1752, or Russia, which did not switch until 1918. This is why the Russian Revolution of 7 November 1917 N.S. is known as the [[October Revolution]], because it began on 25 October OS.\n\nThroughout the long transition period, the Julian calendar has continued to diverge from the Gregorian. This has happened in whole-day steps, as leap days which were dropped in certain centennial years in the Gregorian calendar continued to be present in the Julian calendar. Thus, in the year 1700 the difference increased to 11 days; in 1800, 12; and in 1900, 13. Since 2000 was a leap year according to both the Julian and Gregorian calendars, the difference of 13 days did not change in that year: {{nowrap|29 February 2000}} (Gregorian) fell on {{nowrap|16 February 2000}} (Julian). This difference of 13 days will persist until Saturday 28 February 2100 (Julian), i.e. 13 March 2100 (Gregorian), since 2100 is ''not'' a Gregorian leap year, but ''is'' a Julian leap year; the next day the difference will be of 14 days:  Sunday 29 February (Julian) will be Sunday 14 March (Gregorian); the next day Monday {{nowrap|1 March 2100}} (Julian) falls on Monday {{nowrap|15 March 2100}} (Gregorian).{{sfn|Walker|2009}}\n\n== Modern usage ==\n=== Eastern Orthodox ===\n[[File:Bogojavlenie.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Russian icon]] of the [[Epiphany (feast)|Theophany]] (the baptism of [[Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist]]) (6 January), the highest-ranked feast which occurs on the fixed cycle of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]].]]\n\nAlthough most [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] countries (most of them in [[Eastern Europe|eastern]] or [[southeastern Europe]]) had adopted the Gregorian calendar by 1924, their national churches had not. The \"Revised Julian calendar\" was endorsed by a [[synod]] in [[Constantinople]] in May 1923, consisting of a solar part which was and will be identical to the Gregorian calendar until the year 2800, and a lunar part which calculated [[Easter]] astronomically at [[Jerusalem]].

The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] has some parishes in the West which celebrate the Nativity on 25 December ''Gregorian'' until 2799.\n\nParishes of the [[Orthodox Church in America Bulgarian Diocese]], both before and after the 1976 transfer of that diocese from the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] to the Orthodox Church in America, were permitted to use this date.

They follow a simple cycle of three normal years and one leap year, giving an average year that is 365.25 days long. That is more than the actual [[solar year]] value of 365.24219 days, which means the Julian calendar gains a day every 128 years.\n\nDuring the 20th and 21st centuries, a date according to the Julian calendar is 13 days earlier than its corresponding Gregorian date.\n\n==Table of months==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

In addition, a 27- or 28-day [[intercalary month]], the [[Mercedonius|Mensis Intercalaris]], was sometimes inserted between February and March. This intercalary month was formed by inserting 22 or 23 days after the first 23 days of February; the last five days of February, which counted down toward the start of March, became the last five days of Intercalaris. The net effect was to add 22 or 23 days to the year, forming an intercalary year of 377 or 378 days.<ref>T H Key, \"A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities\" (article ''Calendarium''), London, 1875, available at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html].</ref> Some say the ''mensis intercalaris'' always had 27 days and began on either the first or the second day after the Terminalia (23 February).<ref>Blackburn, B & Holford-Strevens, L ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 1999, reprinted with corrections, 2003, pp. 669\u201370.</ref>\n\nAccording to the later writers [[Censorinus]] and [[Macrobius]], the ideal intercalary cycle consisted of ordinary years of 355 days alternating with intercalary years, alternately 377 and 378 days long. In this system, the average Roman year would have had {{frac|366|1|4}} days over four years, giving it an average drift of one day per year relative to any [[solstice]] or equinox. Macrobius describes a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, there were only three intercalary years, each of 377 days (thus 11 intercalary years out of 24). This refinement averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.\n\nIn practice, intercalations did not occur systematically according to any of these ideal systems, but were determined by the [[Pontifex Maximus|pontifices]]. So far as can be determined from the historical evidence, they were much less regular than these ideal schemes suggest. They usually occurred every second or third year, but were sometimes omitted for much longer, and occasionally occurred in two consecutive years.\n\nIf managed correctly this system could have allowed the Roman year to stay roughly aligned to a tropical year. However, since the pontifices were often politicians, and because a Roman magistrate's term of [[official|office]] corresponded with a calendar year, this power was prone to abuse: a pontifex could lengthen a year in which he or one of his political allies was in office, or refuse to lengthen one in which his opponents were in power.<ref>Censorinus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#20.7 ''De die natali'' 20.7] (Latin)</ref>\n\nIf too many intercalations were omitted, as happened after the [[Second Punic War]] and during the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]], the calendar would drift out of alignment with the tropical year. Moreover, because intercalations were often determined quite late, the average Roman citizen often did not know the date, particularly if he were some distance from the city. For these reasons, the last years of the pre-Julian calendar were later known as \"years of confusion\". The problems became particularly acute during the years of Julius Caesar's pontificate before the reform, 63\u201346&nbsp;BC, when there were only five intercalary months (instead of eight), none of which were during the five Roman years before 46&nbsp;BC.\n\nCaesar's reform was intended to solve this problem permanently, by creating a calendar that remained aligned to the sun without any human intervention. This proved useful very soon after the new calendar came into effect. [[Varro]] used it in 37&nbsp;BC to fix calendar dates for the start of the four seasons, which would have been impossible only 8 years earlier.<ref name=\"Varro\">Varro, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/1*.html#28 ''On Agriculture'' I.1.28.]</ref> A century later, when [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] dated the [[winter solstice]] to 25 December because the sun entered the 8th degree of Capricorn on that date,<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History:'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D18%3Achapter%3D59 ''(Book 18, LIX / LXVI / LXVIII / LXXIV)''.]</ref> this stability had become an ordinary fact of life.\n\n=== Context of the reform ===\nAlthough the approximation of {{frac|365|1|4}} days for the tropical year had been known for a long time<ref>{{cite journal|first=R.

The length of nineteen years in the [[Metonic cycle|cycle of Meton]] was 6,940 days, six hours longer than the mean Julian year. The mean Julian year was the basis of the [[Callippic cycle|76-year cycle]] devised by [[Callippus]] (a student under Eudoxus) to improve the Metonic cycle.\n\nIn Persia (Iran) after the reform in the [[Iranian calendars#Old Persian calendar|Persian calendar]] by introduction of the Persian Zoroastrian (i. e. Young Avestan) calendar in 503&nbsp;BC and afterwards, the first day of the year (1 Farvardin=[[Nowruz]]) slipped against the vernal equinox at the rate of approximately one day every four years.<ref>Hartner, Willy. \"The young Avestan and Babylonian calendars and the antecedents of precession.\" Journal for the History of Astronomy 10 (1979): 1. pp.&nbsp;1\u201322.

An unsuccessful attempt to add an extra day every fourth year was made in 238&nbsp;BC ([[Decree of Canopus]]). Caesar probably experienced this \"wandering\" or \"vague\" calendar in that country. He landed in the Nile delta in October 48&nbsp;BC and soon became embroiled in the Ptolemaic dynastic war, especially after [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] managed to be \"introduced\" to him in [[Alexandria]].\n\nCaesar imposed a peace, and a banquet was held to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Book 10\">Lucan, ''[[Pharsalia]]:'' [http://mcllibrary.org/Pharsalia/book10.html ''Book 10''.]</ref> [[Lucan]] depicted Caesar talking to a wise man called [[Acoreus]] during the feast, stating his intention to create a calendar more perfect than that of Eudoxus<ref name=\"Book 10\" /> (Eudoxus was popularly credited with having determined the length of the year to be {{frac|365|1|4}} days).<ref>\u00c9mile Bi\u00e9mont, ''Rythmes du temps, astronomie et calendriers'', \u00e9d.

According to Macrobius, Caesar was assisted in this by a certain Marcus Flavius.<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.2 ''Saturnalia'' I.14.2] (Latin).</ref>\n\n=== Adoption of the Julian calendar ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2013}}\nCaesar's reform only applied to the [[Roman calendar]]. However, in the following decades many of the local civic and provincial calendars of the empire and neighbouring client kingdoms were aligned to the Julian calendar by transforming them into calendars with years of 365 days with an extra day intercalated every four years.<ref>This section is based on S. Stern, ''Calendars in Antiquity'' (OUP 2012) pp. 259\u2013297.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Calendars_in_Antiquity.html?id=tiMZAI4oS-MC&source=kp_book_description|title=Calendars in Antiquity: Empires, States, and Societies|last=Stern|first=Sacha|date=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958944-9|location=|pages=259\u2013297|language=en}}</ref> The reformed calendars typically retained many features of the unreformed calendars. In many cases, the New Year was not on 1 January, the leap day was not on the bissextile day, the old month names were retained, the lengths of the reformed months did not match the lengths of Julian months, and, even if they did, their first days did not match the first day of the corresponding Julian month. Nevertheless, since the reformed calendars had fixed relationships to each other and to the Julian calendar, the process of converting dates between them became quite straightforward, through the use of conversion tables known as ''hemerologia''.<ref>Studied in detail in W. Kubitschek, ''Die Kalendarb\u00fccher von Florenz, Rom und Leyden'' (Vienna, 1915).</ref> Several of the reformed calendars are only known through surviving hemerologia.\n\nThe three most important of these calendars are the [[Coptic calendar|Alexandrian calendar]], the [[Asian calendar]] and the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Syro-Macedonian]] calendar. Other reformed calendars are known from Cappadocia, Cyprus and the cities of Syria and Palestine. Most reformed calendars were adopted under Augustus, though the calendar of [[Nabatea]] was reformed after the kingdom became the Roman province of Arabia in AD 106. There is no evidence that local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar in the western empire. Unreformed calendars continued to be used in [[Coligny calendar|Gaul]], Greece, Macedon, the Balkans and parts of Palestine, most notably in Judea.\n\nThe Alexandrian calendar adapted the Egyptian calendar by adding a 6th epagomenal day as the last day of the year in every fourth year, falling on 29 August preceding a Julian bissextile day. It was otherwise identical to the Egyptian calendar. The first leap day was in 22&nbsp;BC, and they occurred every four years from the beginning, even though Roman leap days occurred every three years at this time (see [[Julian calendar#Leap year error|Leap year error]]). This calendar influenced the structure of several other reformed calendars, such as those of the cities of Gaza and Ascalon in Palestine, Salamis in Cyprus, and the province of Arabia. It was adopted by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic church]] and remains in use both as the liturgical calendar of the Coptic church and as the civil calendar of [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe Asian calendar was an adaptation of the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Macedonian calendar]] used in the province of Asia and, with minor variations, in nearby cities and provinces. It is known in detail through the survival of decrees promulgating it issued in 8 BC by the proconsul [[Paullus Fabius Maximus]]. It renamed the first month Dios as ''Kaisar'', and arranged the months such that each month started on the ninth day before the kalends of the corresponding Roman month; thus the year began on 23 September, Augustus' birthday. Since Greek months typically had 29 or 30 days, the extra day of 31-day months was named ''Sebaste''\u2014the emperor's day\u2014and was the first day of these months. The leap day was a second Sebaste day in the month of Xandikos, i.e., 24 February. This calendar remained in use at least until the middle of the fifth century AD.\n\nThe Syro-Macedonian calendar was an adaptation of the Macedonian calendar used in Antioch and other parts of Syria. The months were exactly aligned to the Julian calendar, but they retained their Macedonian names and the year began in Dios = November until the fifth century, when the start of the year was moved to Gorpiaios = September.\n\nThese reformed calendars generally remained in use until the fifth or sixth century. Around that time most of them were replaced as civil calendars by the Julian calendar, but with a year starting in September to reflect the year of the [[indiction]] cycle.\n\nThe Julian calendar spread beyond the borders of the Roman Empire through its use as the Christian liturgical calendar. When a people or a country was converted to Christianity, they generally also adopted the Christian calendar of the church responsible for conversion. Thus, Christian Nubia and Ethiopia adopted the Alexandrian calendar, while Christian Europe adopted the Julian calendar, in either the Catholic or Orthodox variant. Starting in the 16th century, European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere likewise inherited the Julian calendar of the mother country, until they adopted the Gregorian reform. The last country to adopt the Julian calendar was the Ottoman Empire, which used it for financial purposes for some time under the name [[Rumi calendar]] and dropped the \"escape years\" which tied it to Muslim chronology in 1840.\n\n== Julian reform ==\n\n=== Realignment of the year ===\nThe first step of the reform was to realign the start of the calendar year (1 January) to the tropical year by making 46&nbsp;BC (708 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]]) 445 days long, compensating for the intercalations which had been missed during Caesar's pontificate. This year had already been extended from 355 to 378 days by the insertion of a regular [[intercalary month]] in February. When Caesar decreed the reform, probably shortly after his return from the [[Battle of Thapsus|African campaign]] in late Quintilis (July), he added 67 more days by inserting two extraordinary intercalary months between November and December.<ref group=\"note\">It is not known why he decided that 67 was the correct number of days to add, nor whether he intended to align the calendar to a specific astronomical event such as the winter solstice. [[Ideler]] suggested (''Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie'' II 123\u2013125) that he intended to align the winter solstice to a supposedly traditional date of 25 December. The number may compensate for three omitted intercalary months (67 = 22+23+22). It also made the distance from 1 March 46&nbsp;BC, the original New Years Day in the Roman calendar, to 1 January 45&nbsp;BC 365 days.</ref>\n\nThese months are called ''Intercalaris Prior'' and ''Intercalaris Posterior'' in letters of [[Cicero]] written at the time; there is no basis for the statement sometimes seen that they were called \"[[Undecimber]]\" and \"[[Duodecember|Duodecimber]]\", terms that arose in the 18th century over a millennium after the Roman Empire's collapse.<ref group=\"note\">E.g., \"... we have a sidelight on what was involved in \"the year of confusion\" as it was called. According to Dion Cassius, the historian, there was a governor in Gaul who insisted that, in the lengthened year, two months' extra taxes should be paid. The extra months were called Undecimber and Duodecimber.\" (P. W. Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9xcbAAAAYAAJ&q=undecimber+duodecimber ''The romance of the calendar''] (New York, 1937), 112). The eponymous dating of the cited passage ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#21 Dio Cassius 54.21]) shows that it actually refers to an event of 15&nbsp;BC, not 46&nbsp;BC.</ref> Their individual lengths are unknown, as is the position of the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] and [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] within them.<ref>J. R\u00fcpke, ''The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History and the Fasti'', 117f., suggests, based on the ritual structures of the calendar, that 5 days were added to November and that the two intercalary months each had 31 days, with Nones and Ides on the 7th and 15th.</ref>\n\nBecause 46&nbsp;BC was the last of a series of irregular years, this extra-long year was, and is, referred to as the \"last year of confusion\". The new calendar began operation after the realignment had been completed, in 45&nbsp;BC.<ref>[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]:'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html#p231 Year of Julius Caesar]), following [[Ideler]], interprets Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.13 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.13] (Latin) to mean that Caesar decreed that the first day of the new calendar began with the new moon which fell on the night of 1/2 January 45&nbsp;BC. (The new moon was on 2 January 45&nbsp;BC (in the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]]) at 00:21 UTC, according to [[Institut de m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste et de calcul des \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e9rides|IMCCE]] (a branch of the [[Paris Observatory]]): [http://bugle.imcce.fr/en/grandpublic/phenomenes/phases_lune/index.php ''Phases of the moon (between \u22124000 and +2500)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720232543/http://bugle.imcce.fr/en/grandpublic/phenomenes/phases_lune/index.php |date=2011-07-20 }}.) However, more recent studies of the manuscripts have shown that the word on which this is based, which was read as ''lunam'', should be read as ''linam'', meaning that Macrobius was simply stating that Caesar published an edict giving the revised calendar \u2013 see e.g., p.99 in the translation of Macrobius by P. Davies. Smith gives no source or justification for his other speculation that Caesar originally intended to commence the year precisely with the winter solstice.</ref>\n\n=== Months ===\n\nThe Julian months were formed by adding ten days to a regular pre-Julian Roman year of 355 days, creating a regular Julian year of 365 days. Two extra days were added to January, Sextilis (August) and December, and one extra day was added to April, June, September and November. February was not changed in ordinary years, and so continued to be the traditional 28 days. Thus, the ordinary (i.e., non-leap year) lengths of all of the months were set by the Julian calendar to the same values they still hold today. (See [[#Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths|Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths (below)]]  for stories purporting otherwise.)\n\nThe Julian reform did not change [[Roman calendar#Months|the method used to account days of the month in the pre-Julian calendar]], based on the Kalends, Nones and Ides, nor did it change the positions of these three dates within the months. Macrobius states that the extra days were added immediately before the last day of each month to avoid disturbing the position of the established religious ceremonies relative to the Nones and Ides of the month.<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.9 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.9] (Latin). Exceptionally, the extra day in April was inserted as the 26th, a.d. VI Kal. Mai. in the Julian calendar, in order to avoid adding a day to the [[Floralia]], which ran from a.d. IV Kal. Mai. (27 April in the pre-Julian calendar) to a.d. V Non. Mai.</ref> However, since Roman dates after the Ides of the month counted down toward the start of the next month, the extra days had the effect of raising the initial value of the count of the day following the Ides in the lengthened months. Thus, in January, Sextilis and December the 14th day of the month became a.d. XIX Kal. instead of a.d. XVII Kal., while in April, June, September and November it became a.d. XVIII Kal.\n\nRomans of the time born after the Ides of a month responded differently to the effect of this change on their birthdays. [[Mark Antony]] kept his birthday on 14 January, which changed its date from a.d. XVII Kal. Feb to a.d. XIX Kal. Feb, a date that had previously not existed. [[Livia]] kept the date of her birthday unchanged at a.d. III Kal. Feb., which moved it from 28 to 30 January, a day that had previously not existed. [[Augustus]] kept his on 23 September, but both the old date (a.d. VIII Kal. Oct.) and the new (a.d. IX Kal. Oct.) were celebrated in some places.\n\nThe inserted days were all initially characterised as ''dies fasti'' ('''F''' \u2013 see [[Roman calendar#Character of the day|Roman calendar]]).<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.12 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.12] (Latin).</ref> The character of a few festival days was changed. In the early Julio-Claudian period a large number of festivals were decreed to celebrate events of dynastic importance, which caused the character of the associated dates to be changed to '''NP'''. However, this practice was discontinued around the reign of [[Claudius]], and the practice of characterising days fell into disuse around the end of the first century AD: the Antonine jurist [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] speaks of ''dies nefasti'' as a thing of the past.<ref>A. K. Michels, ''The Calendar of the Roman Republic'' Appendix II; J. R\u00fcpke, ''The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine'' 113\u2013114, 126\u2013132, 147.</ref>\n\n=== Intercalation ===\nThe old intercalary month was abolished. The new leap day was dated as ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias'' ('the sixth doubled day before the Kalends of March'), usually abbreviated as ''a.d. bis VI Kal. Mart.''; hence it is called in English the [[bissextile]] day. The year in which it occurred was termed ''annus bissextus'', in English the bissextile year.\n\nThere is debate about the exact position of the bissextile day in the early Julian calendar. The earliest direct evidence is a statement of the 2nd century jurist [[Publius Iuventius Celsus|Celsus]], who states that there were two halves of a 48-hour day, and that the intercalated day was the \"posterior\" half. An inscription from AD 168 states that ''a.d. V Kal. Mart.'' was the day after the bissextile day. The 19th century chronologist [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] argued that Celsus used the term \"posterior\" in a technical fashion to refer to the earlier of the two days, which requires the inscription to refer to the whole 48-hour day as the bissextile. Some later historians share this view. Others, following [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], take the view that Celsus was using the ordinary Latin (and English) meaning of \"posterior\". A third view is that neither half of the 48-hour \"bis sextum\" was originally formally designated as intercalated, but that the need to do so arose as the concept of a 48-hour day became obsolete.<ref>W. Sternkopf, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=MmPMaTG2ukYC&pg=PA718 Das Bissextum]\", (JCP 41 (1895) 718\u2013733).</ref>\n\nThere is no doubt that the bissextile day eventually became the earlier of the two days for most purposes. In 238 Censorinus stated that it was inserted after the [[Terminus (god)|Terminalia]] (23 February) and was followed by the last five days of February, i.e., a.d. VI, V, IV, III and prid. Kal. Mart. (which would be 24 to 28 February in a common year and the 25th to 29th in a leap year). Hence he regarded the bissextum as the first half of the doubled day. All later writers, including Macrobius about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter) followed this rule, as does the [[liturgical year|liturgical calendar]] of the Roman Catholic Church. However, Celsus' definition continued to be used for legal purposes. It was incorporated into [[Digest (Roman law)|Justinian's Digest]],<ref>Justinian, [http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Anglica/D50_Scott.htm#XVI Digest 50.16.98].</ref> and in the English statute ''De anno et die bissextili'' of 1236,<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKZFAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA20 |chapter=The statute ''De anno et die bissextili'', made at Westminster, Anno 21 Hen. III. and Anno Dom. 1236 |title=The Statutes at Large from Magna Charta to the End of the Reign of King Henry the Sixth |volume=1 |location=London |year=1763}}</ref> which was not formally repealed until 1879.\n\nThe effect of the bissextile day on the [[nundinal cycle]] is not discussed in the sources. According to Dio Cassius, a leap day was inserted in 41&nbsp;BC to ensure that the first market day of 40&nbsp;BC did not fall on 1 January, which implies that the old 8-day cycle was not immediately affected by the Julian reform. However, he also reports that in AD 44, and on some previous occasions, the market day was changed to avoid a conflict with a religious festival. This may indicate that a single nundinal letter was assigned to both halves of the 48-hour bissextile day by this time, so that the [[Regifugium]] and the market day might fall on the same date but on different days. In any case, the 8-day nundinal cycle began to be displaced by the 7-day [[Seven-day week|week]] in the first century AD, and [[dominical letter]]s began to appear alongside nundinal letters in the fasti.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#33.4 Dio Cassius 48.33.4], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#24.7 60.24.7]; C. J. Bennett, \"The Imperial Nundinal Cycle\", ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 147 (2004) 175\u2013179.</ref>\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages]] days in the month came to be numbered in consecutive day order. Consequently, the leap day was considered to be the last day in February in leap years, i.e., 29 February, which is its current position.\n\n=== Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths ===\nThe Julian reform set the lengths of the months to their modern values. However, a 13th-century scholar, [[Sacrobosco]], proposed a different explanation for the lengths of Julian months<ref>Roscoe Lamont, \"[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1919PA.....27..579P/0000583.000.html The Roman calendar and its reformation by Julius Caesar]\", ''[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]'' '''27''' (1919) 583\u2013595. Sacrobosco's theory is discussed on pages 585\u2013587.</ref> which is still widely repeated but is certainly wrong.\n\nAccording to Sacrobosco, the month lengths for ordinary years in the Roman Republican calendar, from January to December, were:\n\n:30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29, 30, 29.\n\nSacrobosco then thought that Julius Caesar added one day to every month except February, a total of 11 more days to regular months, giving the ordinary Julian year of 365 days. A single leap day could now be added to this extra short February:\n\n:31, 29/30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 30.\n\nHe then said Augustus changed this, by taking one day from February to add it to Sextilis, and then modifying the alternation of the following months, to:\n\n:31, 28/29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31\n\nso that the length of ''Augustus'' (August) would not be shorter than (and therefore inferior to) the length of ''Iulius'' (July), giving us the irregular month lengths which are still in use.\n\nThere is abundant evidence disproving this theory. First, a wall painting of a Roman calendar predating the Julian reform has survived,<ref>{{citation |last=Grout |first=James |title=Fasti Antiates |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/calendar/antiates.html |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu}}</ref><ref>[[:c:File:Museo del Teatro Romano de Caesaraugusta.43.jpg|Reproduction of pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. Month lengths at bottom.</ref> which confirms the literary accounts that the months were already irregular before Julius Caesar reformed them, with an ordinary year of 355 days, not 354, with month lengths arranged as:\n\n:29, 28, 31, 29, 31, 29, 31, 29, 29, 31, 29, 29.\n\nAlso, the Julian reform did not change the dates of the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] and [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]]. In particular, the Ides were late (on the 15th rather than 13th) in March, May, July and October, showing that these months always had 31 days in the Roman calendar,<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#13.7 ''Saturnalia'' 1.13.7] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.7 1.14.7\u20138] (Latin), Censorinus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#20.10 ''De die natali'' 20.10] (Latin), [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Maude/Censorinus/DeDieNatale-Part2.html#chap9 (English)].</ref> whereas Sacrobosco's theory requires that March, May and July were originally 30 days long and that the length of October was changed from 29 to 30 days by Caesar and to 31 days by Augustus. Further, Sacrobosco's theory is explicitly contradicted by the 3rd and 5th century authors Censorinus<ref>Censorinus, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#20.9 ''De die natali'' 20.9] (Latin), [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Maude/Censorinus/DeDieNatale-Part2.html#chap9 (English)]</ref> and Macrobius,<ref>Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.7 ''Saturnalia'' 1.14.7] (Latin)</ref> and it is inconsistent with seasonal lengths given by Varro, writing in 37&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"Varro\" /> before Sextilis was [[Julian calendar#Month names|renamed]] for Augustus in 8&nbsp;BC, with the 31-day Sextilis given by an Egyptian papyrus from 24&nbsp;BC,<ref name=\"papyrus\" /> and with the 28-day February shown in the ''Fasti Caeretani'', which is dated before 12&nbsp;BC.<ref>A.

There is a simple cycle of three \"normal\" years followed by a leap year and this pattern repeats forever without exception. The Julian year is, therefore, on average 365.25 days long. Consequently, the Julian year drifts over time with respect to the [[tropical year|tropical (solar) year]] (365.24217 days).<ref name=\"Richards\">Using value from Richards (2013, p. 587) for tropical year in mean solar days, the calculation is {{nowrap|1/(365.2425-365.24217)}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Greek astronomers had known, at least since [[Hipparchus]],<ref name=\":0\">[[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]], tr. [[G. J. Toomer]], ''[[Almagest|Ptolemy's Almagest]]'', 1998, Princeton University Press, p. 139.

As a result, the calendar year gains about three days every four centuries compared to observed [[equinox]] times and the seasons. This discrepancy was largely corrected by the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] of 1582. The Gregorian calendar has the same months and month lengths as the Julian calendar, but, in the Gregorian calendar, year numbers evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, except that those evenly divisible by 400 remain leap years.<ref name=\":1\">[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars].

Xanthicus shall have 32 days in this intercalary year.<ref>B A Buxton and R Hannah in ''Studies in Latin Literature and Roman History'' (ed. C Deroux), XII 290.</ref> }}\n\nThis is historically correct. It was decreed by [[Paullus Fabius Maximus|the proconsul]] that the first day of the year in the new calendar shall be Augustus' birthday, a.d. IX Kal. Oct. Every month begins on the ninth day before the kalends. The date of introduction, the day after 14 Peritius, was 1 Dystrus, the next month. The month after that was Xanthicus. Thus Xanthicus began on a.d. IX Kal. Mart., and normally contained 31 days. In leap year, however, it contained an extra \"Sebaste day\", the Roman leap day, and thus had 32 days. From the lunar nature of the old calendar we can fix the starting date of the new one as 24&nbsp;January, {{nowrap|a.d. IX Kal. Feb 5 BC}} in the Julian calendar, which was a leap year. Thus from inception the dates of the reformed Asian calendar are in one-to-one correspondence with the Julian.\n\nAnother translation of this inscription is \n{{quote|Intercalation shall commence on the day after the fourteenth day in the current month of Peritius [a.d. IX Kal. Feb], occurring every third year. Xanthicus shall have 32 days in this intercalary year.<ref>U. Laffi, \"Le iscrizioni relative all'introduzione nel 9 a.c. del nuovo calendario della provincia d'Asia\", Studi Classici e Orientali 16 (1967) 5\u201399.</ref>}}\n\nThis would move the starting date back three years to 8&nbsp;BC, and from the lunar synchronism back to 26 January (Julian). But since the corresponding Roman date in the inscription is 24 January, this must be according to the incorrect calendar which in 8&nbsp;BC Augustus had ordered to be corrected by the omission of leap days. As the authors of the previous{{which|date=October 2019}} paper point out, with the correct four-year cycle being used in Egypt and the three-year cycle abolished in Rome, it is unlikely that Augustus would have ordered the three-year cycle to be introduced in Asia.\n\n==Month names==\nThe Julian reform did not immediately cause the names of any months to be changed. The old [[Mercedonius|intercalary month]] was abolished and replaced with a single intercalary day at the same point (i.e., five days before the end of February). January continued to be the first month of the year.\n\nThe Romans later renamed months after Julius Caesar and Augustus, renaming Quintilis as \"Iulius\" (July)<ref name=J /> in 44&nbsp;BC and Sextilis as \"Augustus\" (August) in 8&nbsp;BC. Quintilis was renamed to honour Caesar because it was the month of his birth.<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#76 ''Caesar''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530163202/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#76 |date=2012-05-30 }} 76.1.</ref> According to a ''[[senatus consultum]]'' quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honour Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, occurred in that month.<ref>Suetonius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#31.2 ''Augustus'' 31.2]; Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12.35  ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.35] (Latin)</ref>\n\nOther months were renamed by other emperors, but apparently none of the later changes survived their deaths.

According to his biographer, Charlemagne renamed all of the months agriculturally into German.<ref>Einhard, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.asp#Reforms ''Life of Charlemagne'', 29].</ref> These names were used until the 15th century, over 700 years after his rule, and continued, with some modifications, to see some use as \"traditional\" month names until the late 18th century. The names (January to December) were: ''Wintarmanoth'' (\"winter month\"), ''Hornung'',<ref group=note>This name of February, the only name in the list without the \"month\" suffix, is explained by K\u00f6nig, ''Festschrift Bergmann'' (1997), pp. 425 ff. as a collective of ''[[:wikt:horn|horn]]'', taken to refer to the antlers shed by [[red deer]] during this time. Older explanations compare the name with Old Frisian ''horning'' (Anglo-Saxon ''hornung-sunu'', Old Norse ''hornungr'') meaning \"bastard, illegitimate son\", taken to imply a meaning of \"disinherited\" in reference to February being the shortest of months.</ref> ''Lentzinmanoth'' (\"spring month\", \"[[:wikt:Lent|Lent]] month\"), ''Ostarmanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:Easter|Easter]] month\"), ''Wonnemanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/wunj\u014d|joy]]-month\", a corruption of ''Winnimanoth'' \"pasture-month\"), ''Brachmanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:Brache|fallow]]-month\"), ''Heuuimanoth'' (\"hay month\"), ''Aranmanoth'' (\"[[:wikt:earnian|reaping]] month\"), ''Witumanoth'' (\"wood month\"), ''Windumemanoth'' (\"vintage month\"), ''Herbistmanoth'' (\"harvest month\"), and ''Heilagmanoth'' (\"holy month\").\n\nThe calendar month names used in western and northern Europe, in Byzantium, and by the [[Berber calendar#The months|Berbers]], were derived from the Latin names. However, in eastern Europe older seasonal month names continued to be used into the 19th century, and in some cases are still in use, in many languages, including: [[Belarusian months|Belarusian]], [[Bulgarian months|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian months|Croatian]], [[Czech months|Czech]], Finnish,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordinfo.info/unit/3236/ip:23 |title=Calendar, Finnish |website=English-Word Information}}</ref> [[Georgian calendar|Georgian]], [[Lithuanian calendar#Names of the months|Lithuanian]], [[Macedonian months|Macedonian]], [[Polish months|Polish]], [[Romanian months|Romanian]], [[Slovene months|Slovene]], [[Ukrainian months|Ukrainian]]. When the Ottoman Empire adopted the Julian calendar, in the form of the Rumi calendar, the [[Rumi calendar#History|month names]] reflected Ottoman tradition.\n\n== Year numbering ==\nThe principal method used by the Romans to identify a year for dating purposes was to name it after the two consuls who took office in it, the eponymous period in question being the consular year. Beginning in 153&nbsp;BC, consuls began to take office on 1 January, thus synchronizing the commencement of the consular and calendar years. The calendar year has begun in January and ended in December since about 450&nbsp;BC according to Ovid or since about 713&nbsp;BC according to Macrobius and Plutarch (see [[Roman calendar]]). Julius Caesar did not change the beginning of either the consular year or the calendar year. In addition to consular years, the Romans sometimes used the regnal year of the emperor, and by the late 4th century documents were also being dated according to the 15-year cycle of the [[indiction]]. In 537, [[Justinian I|Justinian]] required that henceforth the date must include the name of the emperor and his regnal year, in addition to the indiction and the consul, while also allowing the use of local [[Calendar era|eras]].\n\nIn 309 and 310, and from time to time thereafter, no consuls were appointed.<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_08_fasti.htm Chronography of AD 354.]</ref> When this happened, the consular date was given a count of years since the last consul (so-called \"post-consular\" dating). After 541, only the reigning emperor held the consulate, typically for only one year in his reign, and so post-consular dating became the norm. Similar post-consular dates were also known in the west in the early 6th century. <!-- Commented out pending further research. [[User:Dojarca]] is up to 4th year of the consulate of [[Justinian II]] with no assurance he is the latest. --~~~~ The last known post-consular date is year 22 after the consulate of [[Heraclius]].{{Verify source|date=August 2007}} The last emperor to hold the consulate was [[Constans II]]. --> The system of consular dating, long obsolete, was formally abolished in the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]], issued in 888.\n\nOnly rarely did the Romans number the year from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the city (of Rome)]], ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' (AUC). This method was used by Roman historians to determine the number of years from one event to another, not to date a year. Different historians had several different dates for the founding. The ''[[Fasti]] Capitolini'', an inscription containing an official list of the consuls which was published by Augustus, used an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of 752&nbsp;BC. The epoch used by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], 753&nbsp;BC, has been adopted by modern historians. Indeed, [[Renaissance]] editors often added it to the manuscripts that they published, giving the false impression that the Romans numbered their years. Most modern historians tacitly assume that it began on the day the consuls took office, and ancient documents such as the ''Fasti Capitolini'' which use other AUC systems do so in the same way. However, Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century AD, states that, in his time, the AUC year began with the [[Parilia]], celebrated on 21 April, which was regarded as the actual anniversary of the foundation of Rome.<ref>Censorinus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Censorinus/text*.html#21.6 ''De die natali'' 21.6] (Latin). Because the festivities associated with the Parilia conflicted with the solemnity of [[Lent]], which was observed until the Saturday before Easter Sunday, the early Roman church did not celebrate Easter after 21 April \u2013 Charles W. Jones, \"Development of the Latin Ecclesiastical calendar\", ''Bedae Opera de Temporibus'' (1943), 1\u2013122, p.28.</ref>\n\nMany local eras, such as the Era of Actium and the [[Spanish Era]], were adopted for the Julian calendar or its local equivalent in the provinces and cities of the Roman Empire. Some of these were used for a considerable time.<ref>For a partial survey see A. E. Samuel, ''Greek and Roman Chronology: calendars and years in classical antiquity'' (Munich, 1972), 245ff. Samuel introduces his survey by saying: \"The number of eras which came into use and then expired to be replaced by yet other eras during Hellenistic and Roman times is probably not infinite, but I have not been able to find the end of them.\" Anatolian eras are exhaustively surveyed in W. Leschhorn, ''Antike \u00c4ren: Zeitrechnung, Politik und Geschichte im Schwarzmeerraum und in Kleinasien n\u00f6rdlich des Tauros'' (Stuttgart, 1993).</ref> Perhaps the best known is the [[Era of Martyrs]], sometimes also called ''Anno Diocletiani'' (after [[Diocletian]]), which was associated with the Alexandrian calendar and often used by the [[Alexandria]]n Christians to number their Easters during the 4th and 5th centuries, and continues to be used by the Coptic and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian]] churches.\n\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, the efforts of Christian chronographers such as [[Annianus of Alexandria]] to date the Biblical creation of the world led to the introduction of [[Anno Mundi]] eras based on this event.<ref>A. A. Mosshammer, ''The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era'' (Oxford, 2008) 27\u201329.</ref> The most important of these was the [[Etos Kosmou]], used throughout the Byzantine world from the 10th century and in Russia until 1700. In the west, the kingdoms succeeding the empire initially used indictions and [[regnal year]]s, alone or in combination. The chronicler [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], in the fifth century, used an era dated from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], but this era was not widely adopted. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] proposed the system of [[Anno Domini]] in 525. This era gradually spread through the western Christian world, once the system was adopted by [[Bede]] in the eighth century.\n\nThe Julian calendar was also used in some Muslim countries. The Rumi calendar, the Julian calendar used in the later years of the [[Ottoman Empire]], adopted an era derived from the lunar [[Islamic calendar|AH]] year equivalent to AD 1840, i.e., the effective Rumi epoch was AD 585. In recent years, some users of the [[Berber calendar#The computation of the years|Berber calendar]] have adopted an era starting in 950&nbsp;BC, the approximate date that the Libyan pharaoh [[Sheshonq I]] came to power in Egypt.\n\n== New Year's Day ==\nThe Roman calendar began the year on 1 January, and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform. However, even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar, they started the new year on different dates. The Alexandrian calendar in Egypt started on 29 August (30 August after an Alexandrian leap year). Several local provincial calendars were aligned to start on the birthday of Augustus, 23 September. The indiction caused the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] year, which used the Julian calendar, to begin on 1 September; this date is still used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] for the beginning of the liturgical year. When the Julian calendar was adopted in AD 988 by [[Vladimir I of Kiev]], the year was numbered Anno Mundi 6496, beginning on 1 March, six months after the start of the Byzantine Anno Mundi year with the same number. In 1492 (AM 7000), [[Ivan III]], according to church tradition, realigned the start of the year to 1 September, so that AM 7000 only lasted for six months in Russia, from 1 March to 31 August 1492.<ref>[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://grigam.narod.ru/kalend/kalen19.htm \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (Calendar history in Russia and in the USSR).]</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages 1 January retained the name ''[[New Year's Day]]'' (or an equivalent name) in all [[western Europe]]an countries (affiliated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]), since the medieval calendar continued to display the months from January to December (in twelve columns containing 28 to 31 days each), just as the Romans had. However, most of those countries began their numbered year on 25 December (the Nativity of [[Jesus]]), 25 March (the [[Annunciation|Incarnation of Jesus]]), or even Easter, as in [[France]] (see the [[Liturgical year]] article for more details).\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, the year most commonly began on 25 December, which, as (approximately) the [[winter solstice]], had marked the start of the year in pagan times, though 25 March (the [[equinox]]) is occasionally documented in the 11th century. Sometimes the start of the year was reckoned as 24 September, the start of the so-called \"western indiction\" introduced by Bede.<ref>M. L. R.

The following table shows the years in which various countries adopted 1 January as the start of the year. Eastern European countries, with populations showing allegiance to the [[orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]], began the year on 1 September from about 988.

They declined to switch to the Gregorian calendar because it had been anathemised by the Church. On 9 April 1924 Archbishop Chrysostomos of Athens explained the calendar change in a circular published in the \"SKRIP\" newspaper.

As originally proposed in 1785 the \"political\" calendar omitted the leap year in centennial years other than those which were exactly divisible by 900 or gave remainder 400 when divided by 900. As it was due to diverge from the Gregorian in 2000 it was modified (under the name \"Revised Julian calendar\") so that there would be no difference until 2800.<ref>Milan S Dimitijevic, ''Milutin Milankovi\u0107 and the reform of Julian calendar on ecoumenical congress in Constantinople in 1923'', Conference paper:  International Conference The Life and Work of Milutin Milancovic, Past, Present, Future, 19\u201321 July 2019, Belgrade.</ref>}}  Most [[Christian denomination]]s in the west and areas evangelised by western churches have made the change to Gregorian for their [[liturgical calendar]]s to align with the civil calendar.  \n\nA calendar similar to the Julian one, the [[Alexandrian calendar]], is the basis for the [[Ethiopian calendar]], which is still the civil calendar of Ethiopia. Egypt converted from the Alexandrian calendar to Gregorian on 1 Thaut 1592/11 September 1875.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4llHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1348&dq=Beardsley+Fish+1875+1348&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiv-_z805reAhVCkSwKHaKmDQoQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&q=Beardsley%20Fish%201875%201348&f=false Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, vol. 2, pp. 1348\u20131349].</ref>\n\nDuring the changeover between calendars and for some time afterwards, [[dual dating]] was used in documents and gave the date according to both systems. In contemporary as well as modern texts that describe events during the period of change, it is customary to clarify to which calendar a given date refers by using an [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S. or N.S. suffix]] (denoting Old Style, Julian or New Style, Gregorian).\n\n=== Transition history ===\n{{See also|Gregorian calendar}}\nThe Julian calendar was in general use in Europe and northern Africa until 1582, when [[Pope Gregory XIII]] promulgated the Gregorian calendar. Reform was required because too many leap days are added with respect to the astronomical seasons on the Julian scheme. On average, the astronomical solstices and the equinoxes advance by 10.8 minutes per year against the Julian year. As a result, the [[Computus|calculated date]] of Easter gradually moved out of alignment with the March equinox.\n[[File:Julian to Gregorian Date Change.png|thumb|This is a visual example of the official date change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian.]]\nWhile Hipparchus and presumably [[Sosigenes of Alexandria|Sosigenes]] were aware of the discrepancy, although not of its correct value,{{sfn|Richards|1998|page=216}} it was evidently felt to be of little importance at the time of the Julian reform (46 BC). However, it accumulated significantly over time: the Julian calendar gained a day every 128 years. By 1582, it was ten days out of alignment from where it supposedly had been in 325 during the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was soon adopted by most Catholic countries (e.g., Spain, Portugal, Poland, most of Italy). Protestant countries followed later, and some countries of eastern Europe even later. In the British Empire (including the [[United States|American colonies]]), Wednesday {{nowrap|2 September 1752}} was followed by Thursday {{nowrap|14 September 1752}}. For 12 years from 1700 Sweden used a [[Swedish calendar|modified Julian calendar]], and adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1753.\n\nSince the Julian and Gregorian calendars were long used simultaneously, although in different places, calendar dates in the transition period are often ambiguous, unless it is specified which calendar was being used. In some circumstances, double dates might be used, one in each calendar. The notation [[Old Style and New Style dates|\"Old Style\" (O.S.)]] is sometimes used to indicate a date in the Julian calendar, as opposed to [[Old Style and New Style dates|\"New Style\" (N.S.)]], which either represents the Julian date with the start of the year as 1 January or a full mapping onto the Gregorian calendar. This notation is used to clarify dates from countries which continued to use the Julian calendar after the Gregorian reform, such as Great Britain, which did not switch to the reformed calendar until 1752, or Russia, which did not switch until 1918. This is why the Russian Revolution of 7 November 1917 N.S. is known as the [[October Revolution]], because it began on 25 October OS.\n\nThroughout the long transition period, the Julian calendar has continued to diverge from the Gregorian. This has happened in whole-day steps, as leap days which were dropped in certain centennial years in the Gregorian calendar continued to be present in the Julian calendar. Thus, in the year 1700 the difference increased to 11 days; in 1800, 12; and in 1900, 13. Since 2000 was a leap year according to both the Julian and Gregorian calendars, the difference of 13 days did not change in that year: {{nowrap|29 February 2000}} (Gregorian) fell on {{nowrap|16 February 2000}} (Julian). This difference of 13 days will persist until Saturday 28 February 2100 (Julian), i.e. 13 March 2100 (Gregorian), since 2100 is ''not'' a Gregorian leap year, but ''is'' a Julian leap year; the next day the difference will be of 14 days:  Sunday 29 February (Julian) will be Sunday 14 March (Gregorian); the next day Monday {{nowrap|1 March 2100}} (Julian) falls on Monday {{nowrap|15 March 2100}} (Gregorian).{{sfn|Walker|2009}}\n\n== Modern usage ==\n=== Eastern Orthodox ===\n[[File:Bogojavlenie.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Russian icon]] of the [[Epiphany (feast)|Theophany]] (the baptism of [[Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist]]) (6 January), the highest-ranked feast which occurs on the fixed cycle of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]].]]\n\nAlthough most [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] countries (most of them in [[Eastern Europe|eastern]] or [[southeastern Europe]]) had adopted the Gregorian calendar by 1924, their national churches had not. The \"Revised Julian calendar\" was endorsed by a [[synod]] in [[Constantinople]] in May 1923, consisting of a solar part which was and will be identical to the Gregorian calendar until the year 2800, and a lunar part which calculated [[Easter]] astronomically at [[Jerusalem]]. All Orthodox churches refused to accept the lunar part, so all Orthodox churches continue to celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar, with the exception of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], which uses the Gregorian ''[[Easter|Paschalion]]''.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.estonianevents.com/estonianorthodoxchurch\n|title=Estonian Orthodox Church (Estonian Events)\n|publisher=Vancouveri Eesti Apostliku \u00d5igeusu Kirik\n|date=2010\n}}</ref><ref>Bishop Photius of Triaditsa, [http://orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/photii_2.aspx \"The 70th Anniversary of the Pan-Orthodox Congress, Part II of II\"]; {{cite web\n|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Moscow-affiliated+Russian+Orthodox+church+grows+in+Helsinki/1135230488329\n|date=21 September 2007\n|title=HELSINGIN SANOMAT (International edition)\n}}</ref>\n\nThe solar part of the Revised Julian calendar was accepted by only some Orthodox churches.

The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] has some parishes in the West which celebrate the Nativity on 25 December ''Gregorian'' until 2799.\n\nParishes of the [[Orthodox Church in America Bulgarian Diocese]], both before and after the 1976 transfer of that diocese from the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] to the Orthodox Church in America, were permitted to use this date. Some [[Old Calendarist]] groups which stand in opposition to the [[state church]]es of their homelands will use the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Epiphany (feast)|Theophany]] ([[January 6 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|6 January]] ''Julian''/19 January ''Gregorian'') as a day for [[Crucession|religious processions]] and the [[Great Blessing of Waters]], to publicise their cause.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n==== Date of Easter ====\nMost branches of the Eastern [[Orthodox Church]] use the Julian calendar for [[Computus|calculating the date of Easter]], upon which the timing of all the other [[moveable feast]]s depends.
