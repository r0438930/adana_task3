The [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|hydrostatic]] main body of the star is surrounded by a dense atmosphere being accelerated outwards into the stellar wind.  An arbitrary point within this wind is defined as the surface for measuring the radius, and different authors may use different definitions.  For example, a [[Rosseland mean opacity|Rosseland optical depth]] of 2/3 corresponds approximately to a visible surface while a Rosseland depth of 20 or 100 corresponds more closely to a physical photosphere.

A N<sub>V</sub> emission line at 2.1&nbsp;\u00b5m is produced relatively deep in the wind and can be used to estimate rotation.  In R136a1 it has a [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] of about [[angstrom|15\u00c5]], indicating a slow or non rotating star, although it could be aligned with its pole facing Earth.

The \"U\u2013V\" colour from the [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2|WFPC2]] 336&nbsp;nm and 555&nbsp;nm filters is &minus;1.28, more indicative of an extremely hot star.<ref name=hunter/> This variation of different colour indices relative to a [[blackbody]] is the result of interstellar dust causing reddening and extinction.  The [[reddening law|reddening]] (E<sub>B\u2013V</sub>) can be used to estimate the level of visual extinction (A<sub>V</sub>).  E<sub>B\u2013V</sub> values of 0.29\u20130.37 have been measured, with considerable uncertainty due to contamination from close neighbours such as [[R136a2]] 0.1\" away, leading to A<sub>V</sub> around 1.80 and a de-reddened B\u2013V (B\u2013V<sub>0</sub>) of \u22120.30.<ref name=hainich/><ref name=arxiv/>\n\nThe [[effective temperature]] of a star can be approximated from the colour, but this is not very accurate and spectral fitting to an atmospheric model is necessary to derive the temperature.  Temperatures of 53,000\u201356,000 K are found for R136a1 using different atmospheric models.  Older models had produced temperatures around 45,000 K and hence dramatically lower luminosities.<ref name=BAT99/>  The extreme temperature of the star causes its [[Planck's law|peak radiation]] to be around 50&nbsp;nm and nearly 99% of the radiation to be emitted outside the visual range (a [[bolometric correction]] around &minus;5).\n\n===Size===\n[[File:Size comparison between R136a1 and sun.gif|thumb|right|A size comparison between R136a1 and the [[Sun]].]]\nR136a1 is around thirty times the radius of the Sun ({{convert|30|solar radius|km au |abbr=on|lk=on|frac=7|disp=x|; }}) which corresponds to a volume 27,000 times larger than the Sun.\n\nR136a1 does not have a well-defined visible surface like the Earth or the Sun.  The [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|hydrostatic]] main body of the star is surrounded by a dense atmosphere being accelerated outwards into the stellar wind.  An arbitrary point within this wind is defined as the surface for measuring the radius, and different authors may use different definitions.  For example, a [[Rosseland mean opacity|Rosseland optical depth]] of 2/3 corresponds approximately to a visible surface while a Rosseland depth of 20 or 100 corresponds more closely to a physical photosphere.  Stellar temperatures are typically quoted at the same depth so that the radius and temperature correspond to the luminosity.<ref name=hainich/><ref name=arxiv/>\n\nR136a1's dimensions are far smaller than the largest stars: [[red supergiant]]s are {{solar radius|several hundred to over a thousand}}, tens of times larger than R136a1.  Despite the large mass and modest dimensions, R136a1 has an average density around 1% of the Sun's. At about 14 [[kilogram|kg]]/[[Cubic meter|m<sup>3</sup>]], it is over 10 times denser than Earth's [[atmosphere]] at [[sea level]]; alternately, around an eightieth the density of [[water]].\n\n===Rotation===\nThe rotation rate of R136a1 cannot be measured directly since the [[photosphere]] is hidden by the dense [[stellar wind]] and the photospheric absorption lines used to measure rotational doppler broadening are not present in the spectrum.  A N<sub>V</sub> emission line at 2.1&nbsp;\u00b5m is produced relatively deep in the wind and can be used to estimate rotation.  In R136a1 it has a [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] of about [[angstrom|15\u00c5]], indicating a slow or non rotating star, although it could be aligned with its pole facing Earth.  R136a2 and a3 are rotating rapidly and the closest evolutionary models for R136a1 match a star still rotating with an equatorial speed of c. 200&nbsp;km/s after c. 1.75 Myr.<ref name=\"arxiv\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\n\n===Current state===\nR136a1 is currently fusing hydrogen to helium, predominantly by the [[CNO cycle]] due to the high temperatures at the core. Despite the Wolf\u2013Rayet spectral appearance, it is a young star.  The emission spectrum is created by a dense stellar wind caused by the extreme luminosity, with the enhanced levels of helium and nitrogen being mixed from the core to the surface by strong convection.
