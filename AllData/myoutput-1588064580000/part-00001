She also starred alongside South Indian superstar Rajinikanth in ''[[Arunachalam (film)|Arunachalam]]'', which became the highest-grossing film of 1997 in Tamil cinema. This stardom made her come out of the shadow of mainstream heroines and she chose scripts which had a wide potential of performance even alongside big stars which was clearly reflected in her movies. Though the industry regarded her to be the golden hand, as a former director's daughter, she always regarded the success not as a one-man show, but the teamwork between 36 departments.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nFurthermore, the critical success of ''Chudalani Vundi'', directed by Gunashekar, opposite Chiranjeevi in 1998 made her reach the pinnacle of her cinema career.

In her first hit in Telugu, in 1993, she acted in the leading role alongside [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] in ''[[Rajendrudu Gajendrudu]]'', directed by [[S. V. Krishna Reddy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The real commercial recognition came with ''[[Hello Brother (1994 film)|Hello Brother]]'' (1994), directed by commercial director E. V. V. Satyanarayana, in which she starred alongside [[Nagarjuna (actor)|Nagarjuna]] and [[Ramya Krishna]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  She had an award-winning role in ''[[Ammoru]]'', directed by [[Kodi Ramakrishna]].

She also starred alongside South Indian superstar Rajinikanth in ''[[Arunachalam (film)|Arunachalam]]'', which became the highest-grossing film of 1997 in Tamil cinema. This stardom made her come out of the shadow of mainstream heroines and she chose scripts which had a wide potential of performance even alongside big stars which was clearly reflected in her movies. Though the industry regarded her to be the golden hand, as a former director's daughter, she always regarded the success not as a one-man show, but the teamwork between 36 departments.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nFurthermore, the critical success of ''Chudalani Vundi'', directed by Gunashekar, opposite Chiranjeevi in 1998 made her reach the pinnacle of her cinema career. She also starred along [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[Prabhudeva]] in ''Kaathala Kaathala'' in Tamil in the same year, dubbed in Telugu as ''Navvandi Lavvandi'', directed by Singeetam Srinivas. ''Pelli Peetalu'' and ''Sri Ramulayya'', ''Ninne Premista'' in Telugu and ''Doni Saagali'' in Kannada were commercially highly successful. ''Anthapuram'', directed by Krishnavamshi, stood as one of the finest performances of Soundarya in her career, winning her a State [[Nandi Award for Best Actress]] and also her second consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]]. The producers and directors realized Soundarya's ability to be a crowd puller and the biggest plus for the promotion of the movie.
