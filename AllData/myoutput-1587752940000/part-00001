{"title_page": "Killing Me Softly with His Song", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{short description|1971 song by Lori Lieberman}}\n\"'''Killing Me Softly with His Song'''\" is a song composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] with lyrics by [[Norman Gimbel]]. The lyrics were written in collaboration with [[Lori Lieberman]] after she was inspired by a [[Don McLean]] performance in late 1971. Lieberman released her version of the song in 1972, but it did not chart. In 1973 it became a number-one hit in the United States and Canada for [[Roberta Flack]], also reaching number six in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song has been covered by many artists; the version by [[Fugees]] won the [[39th Annual Grammy Awards|1997 Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].\n\nAfter decades of confirming Lieberman's important contribution to the song, Fox and Gimbel changed their version of the origin story, to downplay Lieberman's role. Gimbel threatened McLean with a lawsuit in 2008, to remove words from his website saying that McLean was the inspiration for \"Killing Me Softly,\" but McLean dismissed the threat by showing Gimbel his own words confirming the inspiration, published in 1973. \n\n==Lori Lieberman version==\nAspiring musician [[Lori Lieberman]] was 19 years old in 1971 when she was introduced to veteran songwriter [[Norman Gimbel]] and composer [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]]; the two men signed her to a management contract in which they would write her songs and manage her career, and take 20% of her income.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> The three shared a common Jewish heritage and Scorpio astrological signs, and they began to pool songwriting ideas.<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\"/> Gimbel also began an [[affair]] with Lieberman, even though he was 24 years older and married. They kept the affair a secret for years.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nIn November 1971, Lieberman, now 20, went out with her friend Michele Willens to see [[Don McLean]] perform at the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]] nightclub in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\">{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/she-sang-killing-me-softly-before-roberta-flack-now-she-just-wants-you-to-hear-her-side-of-the-story/2020/01/23/9d9dcc7e-3b9d-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html |newspaper = The Washington Post |date = January 24, 2020 |last = Edgers |first = Geoff |title = She sang 'Killing Me Softly' before Roberta Flack.

After the concert, Lieberman phoned Gimbel to read him her napkin notes and share her experience of a singer reaching deep inside her world with his song.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Lieberman's description reminded Gimbel of a song title that was already in his idea notebook, a title that contained \"killing\" and \"softly\".<ref name=Craft/> Gimbel expanded on Lieberman's notes, fleshing them out into song lyrics. Gimbel said in 1973 that \"Her conversation fed me, inspired me, gave me some language and a choice of words.\"<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Gimbel passed these lyrics to Fox, who set them to music.<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\"/>\n\nLieberman recorded the song in late 1971 and released it as a single in 1972, produced by Gimbel and Fox. This version did not chart. Lieberman promoted the album by touring, and she always introduced the song \"Killing Me Softly\" by describing its origin in the McLean performance. Gimbel and Fox even wrote out for her this introduction of the song so that she could deliver it consistently at each performance. In 1973 in her first appearance on national television, Lieberman described this same origin story on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' after performing the song.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> When Lieberman toured through Canada in 1974 to promote her second album, ''Billboard'' magazine carried a public relations piece from [[Capitol Records]] about the three-way \"song-producing team\" of Lieberman/Gimbel/Fox, including a description of the Don McLean performance inspiring the song \"Killing Me Softly\". Gimbel was quoted saying that he relied on Lieberman to inspire his songwriting creativity since he had passed the most creative days of his youth: \"Now I need a reason to write, and Lori is one of the best reasons a lyricwriter could have.\"<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\">{{cite magazine |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YgkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 |page = 53 |title = The Lori Lieberman Team |date = June 24, 1974 |magazine = Billboard }}</ref>\n\nDon McLean said in 1973 that he was surprised to find out that the song described his singing. \"I'm absolutely amazed. I've heard both Lori's and Roberta's version and I must say I'm very humbled about the whole thing. You can't help but feel that way about a song written and performed as well as this one is.\"<ref name=\"nydn\">{{cite news |last = O'Haire |first = Patricia |url = https://don-mclean.com/2009/01/21/the-killing-me-softly-story/ |title = A Killer of a Song |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130514165758/http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |location = New York |work = Daily News }}</ref>\n\n===Disputed origin===\nIn the 1970s both Gimbel and Fox were in agreement with Lieberman about the song's origin at a McLean concert. Sean Derek, who worked for Gimbel and Fox as an assistant in the 1970s, confirmed that the two men would tell the McLean origin story \"all the time\".<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> However, Gimbel and Fox changed their stories around 1997, to reduce or dismiss Lieberman's contribution.\n\nIn 1976, the Lieberman/Gimbel/Fox songwriting team turned sour. Gimbel had divorced his wife three years earlier, but Lieberman eventually stopped the sexual relationship she had with Gimbel because he \"had become emotionally abusive, controlling and unfaithful.\" She asked to be freed of her contract. Gimbel and Fox directed their lawyers to demand $27,000 from Lieberman to pay expenses, and to demand another $250,000 of her future income. Lieberman's lawyer, Frederic Ansis, recalled later that Gimbel and Fox could have been \"nice guys\" like other managers in the industry who released their unsuccessful artists, but they chose the other route.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nBy 1997, Lieberman had long severed her ties to Gimbel, but she reconnected with Fox, who attended a concert of hers.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Lieberman was interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' about her recent songwriting work. In this interview she said that when she was young, Gimbel and Fox had been \"very, very controlling. I felt like I was pushed on stage, and I was singing other people's material, although that material was based on my private diaries. I felt victimized for most of my early career.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/arts/living-in-the-shadow-of-a-famous-song.html |date = June 8, 1997 |title = Living in the Shadow of a Famous Song |last = Pond |first = Steve |page = 34 |newspaper = The New York Times }}</ref> Fox never spoke to her again after this revelation.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nIn 2008, Gimbel demanded that McLean remove text from his website, the text saying that McLean was the inspiration for \"Killing Me Softly\". McLean did not remove the text; instead, McLean's lawyer sent Gimbel a copy of a 1973 ''New York Daily News'' article in which Gimbel is quoted and seems to agree with Lieberman's account.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130514165758/http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg</ref> In the article, Lieberman is asked how the song came about and what its inspiration was.<ref>{{cite news |last = O'Haire |first = Patricia |location = New York |work = Daily News |year = 1973 }}{{full|date=April 2020}}</ref> \n\n{{quote|\"Don McLean,\" she said simply. \"I saw him at the Troubadour in LA last year. (\"And there he was this young boy / A stranger to my eyes\") I had heard about him from some friends but up to then all I knew about him really was what others had told me. But I was moved by his performance, by the way he developed his numbers, he got right through to me. (\"Strumming my pain with his fingers / Killing me softly with his song/ Telling my whole life with his words.\")}}\n\nGimbel's contribution supports Lieberman's stance:\n\n{{quote|\"Lori is only 20 and she really is a very private person,\" he said. \"She told us about this strong experience she had listening to McLean\" (\"I felt all flushed with fever / Embarrassed by the crowd / I felt he had found my letters / And read each one out loud / I prayed that he would finish / But he kept just right on\u2026\")\n\"I had a notion this might make a good song so the three of us discussed it. We talked it over several times, just as we did with the rest of the numbers we wrote for the album and we all felt it had possibilities.\"}}\n\nLieberman then adds:\n\n{{quote|\"Norman had a phrase he liked, 'killing me softly with his blues'\", Lori went on to explain. \"But I didn't feel the word \"blues\" was quite what the effect was. It wasn't contemporary enough, somehow. We talked about it a while and finally decided on the word \"song\" instead. It seemed right then when we did it.\"}} \n\nFox published a memoir in 2010, ''Killing Me Softly, My Life in Music'', which contained nothing about the McLean performance inspiring the song, and downplayed Lieberman's role in the songwriting team.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nWhen Dan MacIntosh of Songfacts asked Fox in 2010 about the McLean origin story, Fox said, \"I think it's called an urban legend. It really didn't happen that way.\" He described Gimbel and himself writing the song, then playing it for Lieberman later, who was reminded of McLean's singing. Fox said that \"somehow the words got changed around so that we wrote it based on Don McLean...\"<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/charles-fox |title = Charles Fox : Songwriter Interviews |first =  |last = Songfacts |website = www.songfacts.com |access-date = December 19, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nGimbel described in 2010 how he had been introduced to the [[Argentinian]]-born composer [[Lalo Schifrin]] (then of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' fame) and began writing songs to a number of Schifrin's films.<ref name=Craft/> Both Gimbel and Schifrin made a suggestion to write a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] together, and Schifrin gave Gimbel an Argentinean novel\u2014''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Hopscotch]]'' by [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]\u2014to read as a possible idea.

ATCQ themselves had sampled the riff from the song \"Memory Band\" from [[psychedelic soul]] band [[Rotary Connection]]'s 1967 [[Rotary Connection (album)|eponymous debut album]]. The Fugees single was so successful that the track was \"deleted\" and thus no longer supplied to retailers whilst the track was still in the top 20 so that attention could be drawn to the next single, \"[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]\". Propelled by the success of the Fugees track, the 1972 recording by Roberta Flack was [[remix]]ed in 1998 with the vocalist adding some new vocal flourishes: this version topped the [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. Flack and the Fugees have performed the song together since then.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite book |author1 = Various Mojo Magazine |title = The Mojo Collection: 4th Edition |page = 626 |date = November 1, 2007 |publisher = Canongate Books |url = https://books.google.be/books?id=AVQbF9lTBwgC&pg=PA626&lpg=PA626&dq=bounty+killer+fugees+killing+me+softly&source=bl&ots=NaKflAMjjZ&sig=DaI2o2Xgad6_sZyuixPR4v7rpQk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiF1avIn7XOAhVDNxQKHWhHDpo4ChDoAQglMAM#v=onepage&q=bounty%20killer%20fugees%20killing%20me%20softly&f=false |access-date = August 9, 2016 }}</ref> In 2008, \"Killing Me Softly\" was ranked number 25 on [[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop and number 44 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Songs of the '90s\".\n\n===Background===\n\"Killing Me Softly\" was the last song the Fugees recorded for ''The Score'', after member [[Pras]] made the suggestion to cover it.

song composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] with lyrics by [[Norman Gimbel]]. The lyrics were written in collaboration with [[Lori Lieberman]] after she was inspired by a [[Don McLean]] performance in late 1971. Lieberman released her version of the song in 1972, but it did not chart. In 1973 it became a number-one hit in the United States and Canada for [[Roberta Flack]], also reaching number six in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song has been covered by many artists; the version by [[Fugees]] won the [[39th Annual Grammy Awards|1997 Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].\n\nAfter decades of confirming Lieberman's important contribution to the song, Fox and Gimbel changed their version of the origin story, to downplay Lieberman's role. Gimbel threatened McLean with a lawsuit in 2008, to remove words from his website saying that McLean was the inspiration for \"Killing Me Softly,\" but McLean dismissed the threat by showing Gimbel his own words confirming the inspiration, published in 1973. \n\n==Lori Lieberman version==\nAspiring musician [[Lori Lieberman]] was 19 years old in 1971 when she was introduced to veteran songwriter [[Norman Gimbel]] and composer [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]]; the two men signed her to a management contract in which they would write her songs and manage her career, and take 20% of her income.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> The three shared a common Jewish heritage and Scorpio astrological signs, and they began to pool songwriting ideas.<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\"/> Gimbel also began an [[affair]] with Lieberman, even though he was 24 years older and married. They kept the affair a secret for years.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nIn November 1971, Lieberman, now 20, went out with her friend Michele Willens to see [[Don McLean]] perform at the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]] nightclub in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/she-sang-killing-me-softly-before-roberta-flack-now-she-just-wants-you-to-hear-her-side-of-the-story/2020/01/23/9d9dcc7e-3b9d-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 24, 2020 |last=Edgers |first=Geoff |title=She sang 'Killing Me Softly' before Roberta Flack.

After the concert, Lieberman phoned Gimbel to read him her napkin notes and share her experience of a singer reaching deep inside her world with his song.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Lieberman's description reminded Gimbel of a song title that was already in his idea notebook, a title that contained \"killing\" and \"softly\".<ref name=Craft/> Gimbel expanded on Lieberman's notes, fleshing them out into song lyrics. Gimbel said in 1973 that \"Her conversation fed me, inspired me, gave me some language and a choice of words.\"<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Gimbel passed these lyrics to Fox, who set them to music.<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\"/>\n\nLieberman recorded the song in late 1971 and released it as a single in 1972, produced by Gimbel and Fox. This version did not chart. Lieberman promoted the album by touring, and she always introduced the song \"Killing Me Softly\" by describing its origin in the McLean performance. Gimbel and Fox even wrote out for her this introduction of the song so that she could deliver it consistently at each performance. In 1973 in her first appearance on national television, Lieberman described this same origin story on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' after performing the song.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> When Lieberman toured through Canada in 1974 to promote her second album, ''Billboard'' magazine carried a public relations piece from [[Capitol Records]] about the three-way \"song-producing team\" of Lieberman/Gimbel/Fox, including a description of the Don McLean performance inspiring the song \"Killing Me Softly\". Gimbel was quoted saying that he relied on Lieberman to inspire his songwriting creativity since he had passed the most creative days of his youth: \"Now I need a reason to write, and Lori is one of the best reasons a lyricwriter could have.\"<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 |page=53 |title=The Lori Lieberman Team |date=June 24, 1974 |magazine=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nDon McLean said in 1973 that he was surprised to find out that the song described his singing. \"I'm absolutely amazed. I've heard both Lori's and Roberta's version and I must say I'm very humbled about the whole thing. You can't help but feel that way about a song written and performed as well as this one is.\"<ref name=\"nydn\">O'Haire, Patricia [https://don-mclean.com/2009/01/21/the-killing-me-softly-story/ \"A Killer of a Song] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514165758/http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg |date=2013-05-14 }},\" ''New York Daily News''</ref>\n\n===Disputed origin===\nIn the 1970s both Gimbel and Fox were in agreement with Lieberman about the song's origin at a McLean concert. Sean Derek, who worked for Gimbel and Fox as an assistant in the 1970s, confirmed that the two men would tell the McLean origin story \"all the time\".<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> However, Gimbel and Fox changed their stories around 1997, to reduce or dismiss Lieberman's contribution.\n\nIn 1976, the Lieberman/Gimbel/Fox songwriting team turned sour. Gimbel had divorced his wife three years earlier, but Lieberman eventually stopped the sexual relationship she had with Gimbel because he \"had become emotionally abusive, controlling and unfaithful.\" She asked to be freed of her contract. Gimbel and Fox directed their lawyers to demand $27,000 from Lieberman to pay expenses, and to demand another $250,000 of her future income. Lieberman's lawyer, Frederic Ansis, recalled later that Gimbel and Fox could have been \"nice guys\" like other managers in the industry who released their unsuccessful artists, but they chose the other route.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nBy 1997, Lieberman had long severed her ties to Gimbel, but she reconnected with Fox, who attended a concert of hers.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Lieberman was interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' about her recent songwriting work. In this interview she said that when she was young, Gimbel and Fox had been \"very, very controlling. I felt like I was pushed on stage, and I was singing other people's material, although that material was based on my private diaries. I felt victimized for most of my early career.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/arts/living-in-the-shadow-of-a-famous-song.html |date=June 8, 1997 |title=Living in the Shadow of a Famous Song |last=Pond |first=Steve |page=34 |newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref> Fox never spoke to her again after this revelation.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nIn 2008, Gimbel demanded that McLean remove text from his website, the text saying that McLean was the inspiration for \"Killing Me Softly\". McLean did not remove the text; instead, McLean's lawyer sent Gimbel a copy of a 1973 ''New York Daily News'' article in which Gimbel is quoted and seems to agree with Lieberman's account.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130514165758/http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg</ref> In the article, Lieberman is asked how the song came about and what its inspiration was.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia, ''New York Daily News'', 1973</ref> \n\n{{quote|\"Don McLean,\" she said simply. \"I saw him at the Troubadour in LA last year. (\"And there he was this young boy / A stranger to my eyes\") I had heard about him from some friends but up to then all I knew about him really was what others had told me. But I was moved by his performance, by the way he developed his numbers, he got right through to me. (\"Strumming my pain with his fingers / Killing me softly with his song/ Telling my whole life with his words.\")}}\n\nGimbel's contribution supports Lieberman's stance:\n\n{{quote|\"Lori is only 20 and she really is a very private person,\" he said. \"She told us about this strong experience she had listening to McLean\" (\"I felt all flushed with fever / Embarrassed by the crowd / I felt he had found my letters / And read each one out loud / I prayed that he would finish / But he kept just right on\u2026\")\n\"I had a notion this might make a good song so the three of us discussed it. We talked it over several times, just as we did with the rest of the numbers we wrote for the album and we all felt it had possibilities.\"}}\n\nLieberman then adds:\n\n{{quote|\"Norman had a phrase he liked, 'killing me softly with his blues'\", Lori went on to explain. \"But I didn't feel the word \"blues\" was quite what the effect was. It wasn't contemporary enough, somehow. We talked about it a while and finally decided on the word \"song\" instead. It seemed right then when we did it.\"}} \n\nFox published a memoir in 2010, ''Killing Me Softly, My Life in Music'', which contained nothing about the McLean performance inspiring the song, and downplayed Lieberman's role in the songwriting team.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nWhen Dan MacIntosh of Songfacts asked Fox in 2010 about the McLean origin story, Fox said, \"I think it's called an urban legend. It really didn't happen that way.\" He described Gimbel and himself writing the song, then playing it for Lieberman later, who was reminded of McLean's singing. Fox said that \"somehow the words got changed around so that we wrote it based on Don McLean...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/charles-fox|title=Charles Fox : Songwriter Interviews|first=|last=Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nGimbel described in 2010 how he had been introduced to the [[Argentinian]]-born composer [[Lalo Schifrin]] (then of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' fame) and began writing songs to a number of Schifrin's films.<ref name=Craft/> Both Gimbel and Schifrin made a suggestion to write a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] together, and Schifrin gave Gimbel an Argentinean novel\u2014''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Hopscotch]]'' by [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]\u2014to read as a possible idea. The book was never made into a musical, but in chapter two, the narrator describes himself as sitting in a bar listening to an American pianist friend \"kill us softly with some blues\".<ref name=Craft>{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Sheila|title=The Craft of Lyric Writing|publisher=Writers Digest Books|year=1984|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uVePZ1Qwtb0C&pg=PA13|accessdate=22 September 2010|isbn=0-89879-149-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cort\u00e1zar|first1=Julio|title=Hopscotch|url=https://archive.org/details/hopscotch0000cort|url-access=registration|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1966|page=[https://archive.org/details/hopscotch0000cort/page/15 15]|isbn=0-394-75284-8}}</ref> Gimbel put the phrase in his notebook of song ideas for use at a future time.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/killingmesoftly.asp|title=The \"Killing Me Softly\" Story|publisher=Don-mclean.com|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=31 March 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519202841/http://www.don-mclean.com/killingmesoftly.asp|archivedate=19 May 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\nLieberman released a song in 2011 called \"Cup of Girl\" with lyrics about being used by someone who would \"rifle through her diary\" to write songs about her, who was dishonest, promiscuous and took advantage of her. Lieberman says that Gimbel contacted her after the song was published, sending angry emails, but Lieberman deleted the emails instead of responding to them.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Gimbel died in 2018. \n\nIn 2020, Lieberman said she was not seeking money or official songwriting credit, she just wanted the world to know the correct origin of the song.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\n==Roberta Flack version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Killing Me Softly with His Song\n| cover      = Killing Me Softly with His Song by Roberta Flack US vinyl.png\n| alt        =\n| caption    = One of A-side labels of U.S. vinyl single\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Roberta Flack]]\n| album      = [[Killing Me Softly (Roberta Flack album)|Killing Me Softly]]\n| B-side     = Just Like a Woman\n| released   = January 22, 1973<ref>http://www.45cat.com/record/452940</ref>\n| format     = [[7-inch single]]\n| recorded   = November 17, 1972\n| studio     = [[Atlantic Studios|Atlantic]], New York City<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfunkportal.com/recordings/6345|title=Killing Me Softly With His Song - Roberta Flack - Recording|website=www.pfunkportal.com|accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[soul music|Soul]]\n| length     = 4:46\n| label      = [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]\n| writer     =\n*[[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]]\n*[[Norman Gimbel]]\n| producer   = [[Joel Dorn]]\n| prev_title = [[Where Is the Love (Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway song)|Where Is the Love]]\n| prev_year  = 1972\n| next_title = Jesse\n| next_year  = 1973\n| misc       = {{Extra album cover\n | header  = Alternative release\n | type    = single\n | cover   = Roberta Flack - Killing Me Softly with His Song.jpg\n | border  =\n | alt     =\n | caption = German single picture sleeve\n}}{{External music video|{{youtube|l2n167F0eBc|\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\"}}\n | type   = single\n | header = Audio\n}}\n}}\n\nLieberman was the first to record the song in late 1971, releasing it in early 1972.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cad|first=Saint|title=Top 10 Famous Songs With Unknown Originals|url=http://listverse.com/2012/07/31/top-10-famous-songs-with-unknown-originals/|work=listverse.com|accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> [[Helen Reddy]] has said she was sent the song, but \"the [[demo (music)|demo]]... sat on my turntable for months without being played because I didn't like the title\".<ref>Reddy, Helen.
