At 7 years old, he began writing poetry. He decided to pursue a career in [[rapping]], and began performing in 1990. In his early rap years, Singleton rapped under the name G-Spade, but later changed his name to Big Lurch after earning that nickname from Nubbins Sawyer. This was due to his intimidating figure, very slim and being 6 foot and 7 inches tall (reminiscent of the character  [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]] from ''The Addams Family'').\n\nOn September 16, 2000, one day after his 27th birthday, Singleton was driving his car when a drunk driver hit him, resulting in his neck being broken. While in the hospital he was heavily medicated. It was while on medication that he wrote one of his songs, \"Texas Boy\", for his album, ''[[It's All Bad]]''. After being released from the hospital, he had trouble walking and was still in pain. Singleton admitted, in ''Rhyme And Punishment'', that he began using [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] to ease the pain.\n\n== Murder and lawsuit ==\nOn April 10, 2002, 28-year-old Singleton murdered Tynisha Ysais in her apartment in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=\"Malnic\" /><ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite news |last1=Kelleher |first1=Jennifer Sinco |title=Aspiring Texas Rapper to Stand Trial in Death of L.A.
