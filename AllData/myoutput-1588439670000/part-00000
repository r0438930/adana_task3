It was produced by [[Antony Perumbavoor]] for [[Aashirvad Cinemas]] and starred [[Mohanlal]], [[Anusree]], [[Samuthirakani]], [[Vimala Raman]], [[Nedumudi Venu]], and [[Baby Meenakshi]]. The film contains songs composed by the group [[4 Musics]], and the score was composed by [[Ron Ethan Yohann]]. [[N. K. Ekambaram]] was the cinematographer.\n\nThe plot follows Jayaraman (Mohanlal), a blind [[Elevator operator|lift operator]] and caretaker in an apartment building. The trusted friend of Justice Krishnamoorthy (Venu), he cares for his schoolgirl daughter Nandini (Meenakshi). Krishnamoorthy is murdered by a serial killer with a connection to his past. Jayaraman is framed for the crime, and must protect Nandini from the killer and prove his innocence.\n\nRegular collaborators Mohanlal and Priyadarshan were expected to work on a film in 2015, but it was postponed before [[principal photography]] began until the following year. Priyadarshan decided to make another film with Mohanlal, and began looking at screenplays. Both men wanted a break from their usual comedy films. Priyadarshan agreed on a short story by Govind Vijayan which was suggested by Mohanlal. The director developed a plot and screenplay, which was on its final draft in February 2016. The film began principal photography in March and ended in June; it was filmed in [[Kochi]], [[Ooty]], [[Vagamon]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], and [[Idukki district|Idukki]].\n\n''Oppam'' was released in India on 8 September 2016 and internationally on 21 September. The film performed well at the box office, grossing over {{INRConvert|650|m}} worldwide on a budget of {{INRConvert|70|m}}. It became the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films#Highest-grossing Malayalam films|third-highest-grossing Malayalam film of all time]] and the second-highest-grossing Malayalam film of the year, behind ''[[Pulimurugan]]''. ''Oppam'' received generally-positive reviews from critics, who praised Mohanlal's performance and the film's narrative style. At the [[Filmfare Awards South]], the film was nominated in five categories (including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film \u2013 Malayalam|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director \u2013 Malayalam|Best Director]] for Priyadarshan and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor \u2013 Malayalam|Best Actor]] for Mohanlal) and won in the categories of [[Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist \u2013 Malayalam|Best Lyricist]] (for [[Madhu Vasudevan]]) and [[Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer \u2013 Malayalam|Best Male Playback Singer]] (for [[M. G. Sreekumar]]). It was dubbed and released in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Kanupapa'' on 3 February 2017, and remade in [[Kannada]] in 2019 as ''[[Kavacha]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nJayaraman was born [[Visual impairment|blind]], but has a heightened sense of smell, hearing and touch and is an expert in the martial art of [[kalaripayattu]]. Part of a large family, he works as a [[Elevator operator|lift operator]] and caretaker in a [[Kochi]] apartment building and is struggling to earn money for his sister's wedding. Jayaraman is loyal to Krishnamoorthy, a retired [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice]] who lives in the building, and accompanies Krishnamoorthy unquestioningly on a long search for someone.\n\nOn one trip, Krishnamoorthy tells Jayaraman the story behind his search. Years ago, a man named Vasudevan (Vasu) was imprisoned by Krishnamoorthy for a crime he did not commit; the judge followed the [[letter of the law]], although he knew that Vasu was innocent. As a result, Vasu's family poisoned themselves. Vasu, insane with grief, resolves to avenge his loss and tells Krishnamoorthy that he will kill him and his family. Vasu has been released from prison, and Krishnamoorthy feels threatened.\n\nKrishnamoorthy has a young daughter, Nandini, and is afraid that Vasu will kill her if he learns of her existence. To keep her safe, he sent her to a convent school and she knows nothing about him. Nandini's only link to her father is via Jayaraman, who frequently visits her at Krishnamoorthy's request. She asks Jayaraman about her father at each visit, and he replies that he will bring him the next time.\n\nKrishnamoorthy asks Jayaraman to help him transfer money from his bank account to another account he opened for Nandini. To reduce scrutiny, they avoid an electronic transfer. Jayaraman withdraws the money and gives it to Krishnamoorthy; the transaction is seen by Devayani, a divorcee and maid in the apartment building. Krishnamoorthy puts the money in a safe in his apartment.\n\nA large wedding takes place, to which everyone in the building is invited. Jayaraman goes to Krishnamoorthy's apartment after the party to find him dead and the money missing from the judge's safe. He senses the presence of someone else in the apartment; the killer tries to escape, but Jayaraman subdues him. After learning Jayaraman is blind, Vasu, the killer sneak past him and escapes in a car.\n\nIn the chaos, it is discovered that Krishnamoorthy's money is missing and the police accuse Jayaraman of stealing it. They learn at the police station that Devayani's brother had the money, but Jayaraman is charged with murder. He vainly pleads for a chance to find the killer, whose presence he could sense. After Jayaraman is beaten by the police during an interrogation, he fights back and escapes. He tries to hide Nandini from Vasu with the aid of his friend Ganga, a police officer.\n\nJayaraman reveals to Ganga that Nanidini is actually Vasu's daughter, whom the madman is trying to kill. He, Nandini and Ganga hide in the convent under the Mother Superior's supervision. Vasu arrives, and when he approaches Nandini Jayaraman calls his cell phone. When Jayaraman hears the ringtone, he shoots Vasu dead. The film ends with Jayaraman and Nandini beginning a life together as a loving father and daughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mohanlal]] as Jayaraman, caretaker and lift operator in an apartment building\n* [[Anusree]] as Ganga, [[Deputy superintendent|Assistant Commissioner of Police]]\n* [[Samuthirakani]] as Vasudevan, a serial killer\n* [[Vimala Raman]] as Devayani, apartment maid\n* [[Nedumudi Venu]] as Krishnamoorthy, former [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice of India|Chief Justice]]\n* [[Baby Meenakshi]] as Nandini, Krishnamoorthy's daughter\n* [[Renji Panicker]] as Padmakumar P, [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] officer\n* [[Chemban Vinod Jose]] as Anandhan R, [[Inspector|Circle Inspector]]\n* [[Mamukkoya]] as Kunju \"Kunjikka\" Mohammad, security guard\n* [[Hareesh Kanaran]] as Veeran, security guard\n* [[Kalabhavan Shajohn]] as Madhu, police officer\n* [[Kunchan (actor)|Kunchan]] as Ganga's grand father\n* [[Idavela Babu]] as Swaminathan, apartment resident\n* [[Aju Varghese]] as \"Maala\" Babu, auto-driver\n* [[Manikuttan]] as Devayani's brother\n* [[Arjun Nandhakumar]] as Ravi, apartment resident\n* [[Kalasala Babu]] as R.

It was produced by [[Antony Perumbavoor]] for [[Aashirvad Cinemas]] and starred [[Mohanlal]], [[Anusree]], [[Samuthirakani]], [[Vimala Raman]], [[Nedumudi Venu]], and [[Baby Meenakshi]]. The film contains songs composed by the group [[4 Musics]], and the score was composed by [[Ron Ethan Yohann]]. [[N. K. Ekambaram]] was the cinematographer.\n\nThe plot follows Jayaraman (Mohanlal), a blind [[Elevator operator|lift operator]] and caretaker in an apartment building. The trusted friend of Justice Krishnamoorthy (Venu), he cares for his schoolgirl daughter Nandini (Meenakshi). Krishnamoorthy is murdered by a serial killer with a connection to his past. Jayaraman is framed for the crime, and must protect Nandini from the killer and prove his innocence.\n\nRegular collaborators Mohanlal and Priyadarshan were expected to work on a film in 2015, but it was postponed before [[principal photography]] began until the following year. Priyadarshan decided to make another film with Mohanlal, and began looking at screenplays. Both men wanted a break from their usual comedy films. Priyadarshan agreed on a short story by Govind Vijayan which was suggested by Mohanlal. The director developed a plot and screenplay, which was on its final draft in February 2016. The film began principal photography in March and ended in June; it was filmed in [[Kochi]], [[Ooty]], [[Vagamon]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], and [[Idukki district|Idukki]].\n\n''Oppam'' was released in India on 8 September 2016 and internationally on 21 September. The film performed well at the box office, grossing over {{INRConvert|650|m}} worldwide on a budget of {{INRConvert|70|m}}. It became the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films#Highest-grossing Malayalam films|third-highest-grossing Malayalam film of all time]] and the second-highest-grossing Malayalam film of the year, behind ''[[Pulimurugan]]''. ''Oppam'' received generally-positive reviews from critics, who praised Mohanlal's performance and the film's narrative style. At the [[Filmfare Awards South]], the film was nominated in five categories (including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film \u2013 Malayalam|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director \u2013 Malayalam|Best Director]] for Priyadarshan and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor \u2013 Malayalam|Best Actor]] for Mohanlal) and won in the categories of [[Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist \u2013 Malayalam|Best Lyricist]] (for [[Madhu Vasudevan]]) and [[Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer \u2013 Malayalam|Best Male Playback Singer]] (for [[M. G. Sreekumar]]). It was dubbed and released in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Kanupapa'' on 3 February 2017, and remade in [[Kannada]] in 2019 as ''[[Kavacha]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nJayaraman was born [[Visual impairment|blind]], but has a heightened sense of smell, hearing and touch and is an expert in the martial art of [[kalaripayattu]]. Part of a large family, he works as a [[Elevator operator|lift operator]] and caretaker in a [[Kochi]] apartment building and is struggling to earn money for his sister's wedding. Jayaraman is loyal to Krishnamoorthy, a retired [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice]] who lives in the building, and accompanies Krishnamoorthy unquestioningly on a long search for someone.\n\nOn one trip, Krishnamoorthy tells Jayaraman the story behind his search. Years ago, a man named Vasudevan (Vasu) was imprisoned by Krishnamoorthy for a crime he did not commit; the judge followed the [[letter of the law]], although he knew that Vasu was innocent. As a result, Vasu's family poisoned themselves. Vasu, insane with grief, resolves to avenge his loss and tells Krishnamoorthy that he will kill him and his family. Vasu has been released from prison, and Krishnamoorthy feels threatened.\n\nKrishnamoorthy has a young daughter, Nandini, and is afraid that Vasu will kill her if he learns of her existence. To keep her safe, he sent her to a convent school and she knows nothing about him. Nandini's only link to her father is via Jayaraman, who frequently visits her at Krishnamoorthy's request. She asks Jayaraman about her father at each visit, and he replies that he will bring him the next time.\n\nKrishnamoorthy asks Jayaraman to help him transfer money from his bank account to another account he opened for Nandini. To reduce scrutiny, they avoid an electronic transfer. Jayaraman withdraws the money and gives it to Krishnamoorthy; the transaction is seen by Devayani, a divorcee and maid in the apartment building. Krishnamoorthy puts the money in a safe in his apartment.\n\nA large wedding takes place, to which everyone in the building is invited. Jayaraman goes to Krishnamoorthy's apartment after the party to find him dead and the money missing from the judge's safe. He senses the presence of someone else in the apartment; the killer tries to escape, but Jayaraman subdues him. After learning Jayaraman is blind, Vasu, the killer sneak past him and escapes in a car.\n\nIn the chaos, it is discovered that Krishnamoorthy's money is missing and the police accuse Jayaraman of stealing it. They learn at the police station that Devayani's brother had the money, but Jayaraman is charged with murder. He vainly pleads for a chance to find the killer, whose presence he could sense. After Jayaraman is beaten by the police during an interrogation, he fights back and escapes. He tries to hide Nandini from Vasu with the aid of his friend Ganga, a police officer.\n\nJayaraman reveals to Ganga that Nanidini is actually Vasu's daughter, whom the madman is trying to kill. He, Nandini and Ganga hide in the convent under the Mother Superior's supervision. Vasu arrives, and when he approaches Nandini Jayaraman calls his cell phone. When Jayaraman hears the ringtone, he shoots Vasu dead. The film ends with Jayaraman and Nandini beginning a life together as a loving father and daughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mohanlal]] as Jayaraman, caretaker and lift operator in an apartment building\n* [[Anusree]] as Ganga, [[Deputy superintendent|Assistant Commissioner of Police]]\n* [[Samuthirakani]] as Vasudevan, a serial killer\n* [[Vimala Raman]] as Devayani, apartment maid\n* [[Nedumudi Venu]] as Krishnamoorthy, former [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice of India|Chief Justice]]\n* [[Baby Meenakshi]] as Nandini, Krishnamoorthy's daughter\n* [[Renji Panicker]] as Padmakumar P, [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] officer\n* [[Chemban Vinod Jose]] as Anandhan R, [[Inspector|Circle Inspector]]\n* [[Mamukkoya]] as Kunju \"Kunjikka\" Mohammad, security guard\n* [[Hareesh Kanaran]] as Veeran, security guard\n* [[Kalabhavan Shajohn]] as Madhu, police officer\n* [[Kunchan (actor)|Kunchan]] as Ganga's grand father\n* [[Idavela Babu]] as Swaminathan, apartment resident\n* [[Aju Varghese]] as \"Maala\" Babu, auto-driver\n* [[Manikuttan]] as Devayani's brother\n* [[Arjun Nandhakumar]] as Ravi, apartment resident\n* [[Kalasala Babu]] as R.
