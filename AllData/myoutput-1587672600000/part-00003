The construction of the [[Uglich Reservoir]] caused the flooding of several monasteries with buildings dating from the 15th and 16th centuries.

The Volga was (and still is) a vital transport route between central Russia and the Caspian Sea, which provides access to the oil fields of the [[Apsheron Peninsula]].\n[[Hitler]] planned to use access to the oil fields of [[Azerbaijan]] to fuel future German conquests.

At the same time, Germany could permanently deny this transport route by the Soviet Union, hampering its access to oil and to supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]].\n\nFor this reason, many [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] military assaults were brought about in an attempt to remove the other side from the banks of the river. In these battles, the Soviet Union was the main [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] side, while the [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] used a more [[defense (military)|defensive]] stance, though much of the fighting was [[close combat|close quarters combat]], with no clear offensive or defensive side.\n\n==Ethnic groups==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430 \u0443 \u0416\u0438\u0433\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u044e.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The Volga in the [[Zhiguli Mountains]].]]\nMany different ethnicities lived on the Volga river.

The [[Muslim]] [[Tatars]] are descendants of the population of medieval [[Volga Bulgaria]]. Another Turkic group, the [[Nogais]], formerly inhabited the lower Volga steppes.\n\nThe Volga region is home to a German minority group, the [[Volga Germans]]. [[Catherine the Great]] had issued a Manifesto in 1763 inviting all foreigners to come and populate the region, offering them numerous incentives to do so. This was partly to develop the region but also to provide a buffer zone between the Russians and the [[Mongols]] to the East. Because of conditions in German territories, Germans responded in the largest numbers.
