The film tells the story of 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), a recent college graduate with no well-defined aim in life, who is seduced by an older woman, Mrs. Robinson ([[Anne Bancroft]]), and then falls in love with her daughter Elaine ([[Katharine Ross]]).\n\nThe film was released on December 22, 1967, received positive reviews and grossed $104.9{{nbsp}}million in the U.S. and Canada.

In 1996, ''The Graduate'' was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Initially, the film was placed at No.7 on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list in 1998. When [[American Film Institute|AFI]] [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|revised the list in 2007]], the film was moved to No.17.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1967, Benjamin Braddock, aged 20, has earned his [[bachelor's degree]] from a college on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and has returned home to a party celebrating his [[graduation]] at his parents' house in [[Pasadena, California]]. Benjamin has no idea of what to do with his life and is visibly unhappy as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. He hides from those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is persuaded inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see Elaine's portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin rejects her but a few days later, he awkwardly organizes a meeting at the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the pseudonym Gladstone.\n\nBenjamin spends the rest of the summer relaxing around the pool by day, refusing to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. He discovers that he and Mrs. Robinson have nothing to talk about. However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine. Both Mr. Robinson and Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, but, in private, Mrs. Robinson forbids him.\n\nBenjamin decides to take Elaine on a date in order to  ruin it: he ignores her, drives dangerously, and takes her to a strip club. After she runs out of the club in tears, he changes his mind, apologizes for his behavior, and discovers that Elaine is someone he is happy to be around. In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft Hotel, but when the staff greet Benjamin as \"Mr. Gladstone\", Elaine deduces that he has been having an affair with a married woman. She accepts his acknowledgement that the affair is over, but an angry Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair. To prevent this, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother.\n\nElaine is disgusted and returns to school at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. Benjamin follows her there and tries to charm her. She reveals that her mother's story is that he [[rape]]d her while she was [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], and she refuses to believe that her mother actually seduced Benjamin.\n\nAfter [[stalking]] her for several days and continuously proposing to her, Benjamin begins to make amends with Elaine. However, Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley after learning about the affair, confronts Benjamin at his rooming house, and threatens to put him behind bars if Benjamin sees his daughter again. Mr. Robinson then forces Elaine to drop out of college and takes her away to marry Carl, a classmate with whom she briefly had a relationship.\n\nReturning to Pasadena in search of Elaine, Benjamin breaks into the Robinson home but encounters Mrs. Robinson. She tells him he will not be able to stop the wedding with Carl and then calls the police, claiming that her house is being burglarized.\n\nBenjamin visits Carl's fraternity brothers who tell him that the wedding is in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] that morning. He rushes to the church and arrives just as Elaine is married, witnessing the kiss. He bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams \"Elaine!\" frantically. After hesitating, Elaine screams \"Ben!\" and looks at him pitifully. He rushes toward her, and a fight ensues as guests try to stop the two from leaving together. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who then slaps her. Benjamin manages to keep the guests at bay by picking up a large cross and wielding it, then jamming the church doors shut with it. Both he and Elaine then run into the street to flag down a passing bus and take the back seat, [[Elopement|eloping]].\n\nHowever, as they settle into their seats, their faces change from happiness to uncertainty as \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" plays.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Mrs. Robinson\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Benjamin Braddock\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Elaine Robinson\n* [[William Daniels]] as Mr. Braddock\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mr. Robinson\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Mrs. Braddock\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Room clerk\n* Brian Avery as Carl Smith\n* [[Walter Brooke]] as Mr. McGuire\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Mr. McCleery\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Mrs. Singleman\n* [[Marion Lorne]] as Miss DeWitte\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nNichols' first choice for Mrs. Robinson was French actress [[Jeanne Moreau]].<ref>The audio commentary by Mike Nichols and Steven Soderbergh in Criterion Collection BD and DVD.</ref> The idea behind this was that in the French culture, the \"older\" women tended to \"train\" the younger men in sexual matters (it is a cliche). There were numerous actors considered or tested for, or who wanted, roles in the film. [[Doris Day]] turned down an offer because the nudity required by the role offended her.<ref name=mcgee>{{cite book| title=Doris Day: Sentimental Journey| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfbcA3zFlNgC&pg=PT326&dq=doris+day+graduate&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y-8UU9-RNOfN0wHi5IHQAg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=graduate&f=false| last=McGee| first=Garry| date=November 22, 2011| page=160| publisher=McFarland| isbn=978-0-7864-6107-3| accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> [[Joan Crawford]] inquired as to play the part, while [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]] both wanted the role. [[Patricia Neal]] turned down the film as she had recently recovered from a stroke and did not feel ready to accept such a major role. [[Geraldine Page]] also turned it down. Other actors considered for the part included [[Claire Bloom]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Susan Hayward]], [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]], [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Simone Signoret]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Eleanor Parker]], [[Anne Baxter]] and [[Shelley Winters]]. [[Angela Lansbury]] also asked about playing the part. [[Ava Gardner]] sought the role of Mrs. Robinson, and reportedly called Nichols saying,\"I want to see you! I want to talk about this ''Graduate'' thing!\" Nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as Bancroft was 35 and Gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel. He later recounted that \"she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star clich\u00e9. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'\" Meanwhile, [[Natalie Wood]] turned down not only the role of Mrs. Robinson, but also that of Elaine.\n\nFor the character of Elaine, casting was also an issue. [[Patty Duke]] turned down the part as she did not want to work at the time. [[Faye Dunaway]] was also considered for Elaine, but had to turn it down, in favor of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. [[Sally Field]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] refused the role as well. [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Joan Collins]] both wanted the role, but did not succeed in getting it. [[Carroll Baker]] tested, but was said to have been too old to portray Anne Bancroft's daughter. [[Candice Bergen]] screen-tested as well, as did [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. Additionally, [[Ann-Margret]], [[Elizabeth Ashley]], [[Carol Lynley]], [[Sue Lyon]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Pamela Tiffin]], [[Julie Christie]], and [[Tuesday Weld]] were all on the director's shortlist before [[Katharine Ross]] was cast.\n\nWhen [[Dustin Hoffman]] auditioned for the role of Benjamin, he was just short of his 30th birthday at the time of filming. He was asked to perform a love scene with Ross, having previously never done one during his acting classes and believed that, as he said later, \"a girl like [Ross] would never go for a guy like me in a million years.\" Ross agreed, believing that Hoffman \"look[ed] about 3 feet tall ... so unkempt. This is going to be a disaster.\" Producer [[Joseph E. Levine]] later admitted that he at first believed that Hoffman \"was one of the messenger boys.\" Despite&mdash;or perhaps because of\u2014Hoffman's awkwardness, Nichols chose him for the film.<ref name=\"life19671124\">{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA71&pg=PA111#v=onepage&f=true| title=The Graduate| work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]| date=24 November 1967| accessdate=2014-03-03| last=Zeitlin| first=David| page=111}}</ref> \"As far as I'm concerned, Mike Nichols did a very courageous thing casting me in a part that I was not right for, meaning I was Jewish,\" said Hoffman. \"In fact, many of the reviews were very negative.

Beatty turned the film down as he was occupied with ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. Redford tested for the part of Benjamin (with [[Candice Bergen]] as Elaine), but Nichols thought Redford did not possess the underdog quality Benjamin needed.<ref name=kashner>{{cite magazine | title=Here's to You, Mr. Nichols: The Making of ''The Graduate'' | url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/03/graduate200803 | last=Kashner| first=Sam | work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date=March 2008 | accessdate=2018-11-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the role of Mr. Robinson, [[Gene Hackman]] was originally cast, but just before filming began, the director decided he was too young and decided to replace him. [[Marlon Brando]], [[Howard Duff]], [[Brian Keith]], [[George Peppard]], [[Jack Palance]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Gregory Peck]] were all other choices for the role that [[Murray Hamilton]] eventually played. [[Susan Hayward]] was the first choice for Benjamin's mother, Mrs. Braddock, but the role was given to [[Elizabeth Wilson]]. And to play Mr. Braddock, [[Yul Brynner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] (who had been [[Governor of California]] for nearly a year when the film was released) all came close to getting the role that ended up going to [[William Daniels]].<ref name=kashner />\n\n===Filming locations===\nMany of the exterior university campus shots of Berkeley were actually filmed on the brick campus of [[University of Southern California|USC]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=USCfilming>{{cite web |title=USC's Lists & Urban Legends: Just a Few of the Feature Films Shot on the University Park Campus |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |last=Moore |first=Annette |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |date=Spring 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527071350/http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe church used for the wedding scene is actually the [[United Methodist Church]] in [[La Verne, California|La Verne]]. In a commentary audio released with the 40th anniversary DVD, Hoffman revealed that he was uneasy about the scene in which he pounds on the church window, as the minister of the [[Church (building)|church]] had been watching the filming disapprovingly. The wedding scene was highly influenced by the ending of the 1924 comedy film ''[[Girl Shy]]'' starring [[Harold Lloyd]], who also served as an advisor for the scene in ''The Graduate''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1443795|title=Silent Salon 2015 // Girl Shy|publisher=brownpapertickets.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctormacro.com/Movie%20Summaries/G/Girl%20Shy.htm|title=Girl Shy|publisher=doctormacro.com}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Graduate (soundtrack)}}\nThe film boosted the profile of [[folk-rock]] duo [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. Originally, Nichols and O'Steen used their existing songs like \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" merely as a pacing device for the editing until Nichols decided that substituting original music would not be effective and decided to include them on the soundtrack, an unusual move at that time.<ref name=harris>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Mark |title=Pictures at a Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0/page/360 |date=February 14, 2008 |publisher=The Penguin Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0/page/360 360\u20131] |isbn=978-1-5942-0152-3 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nAccording to a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' article by [[Peter Bart]] in the May 15, 2005, issue, [[Lawrence Turman]], his producer, then made a deal for Simon to write three new songs for the movie. By the time they had nearly finished editing the film, Simon had only written one new song. Nichols begged him for more, but Simon, who was touring constantly, told him he did not have the time. He did play him a few notes of a new song he had been working on; \"It's not for the movie... it's a song about times past\u2014about [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Mrs. Roosevelt]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] and stuff.\" Nichols advised Simon, \"It's now about [[Mrs. Robinson]], not Mrs. Roosevelt.\"<ref name=bart>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/columns/the-perfect-pic-alignment-1117922805/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Peter |last=Bart |author-link=Peter Bart |title=The perfect pic alignment |date=May 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Graduate'' was met with generally positive reviews from critics upon its release.

In 1996, ''The Graduate'' was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Initially, the film was placed at No.7 on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list in 1998. When [[American Film Institute|AFI]] [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|revised the list in 2007]], the film was moved to No.17.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1967, Benjamin Braddock, aged 20, has earned his [[bachelor's degree]] from a college on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and has returned home to a party celebrating his [[graduation]] at his parents' house in [[Pasadena, California]]. Benjamin has no idea of what to do with his life and is visibly unhappy as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. He hides from those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is persuaded inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see Elaine's portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin rejects her but a few days later, he awkwardly organizes a meeting at the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the pseudonym Gladstone.\n\nBenjamin spends the rest of the summer relaxing around the pool by day, refusing to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. He discovers that he and Mrs. Robinson have nothing to talk about. However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine. Both Mr. Robinson and Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, but, in private, Mrs. Robinson forbids him.\n\nBenjamin decides to take Elaine on a date in order to  ruin it: he ignores her, drives dangerously, and takes her to a strip club. After she runs out of the club in tears, he changes his mind, apologizes for his behavior, and discovers that Elaine is someone he is happy to be around. In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft Hotel, but when the staff greet Benjamin as \"Mr. Gladstone\", Elaine deduces that he has been having an affair with a married woman. She accepts his acknowledgement that the affair is over, but an angry Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair. To prevent this, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother.\n\nElaine is disgusted and returns to school at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. Benjamin follows her there and tries to charm her. She reveals that her mother's story is that he [[rape]]d her while she was [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], and she refuses to believe that her mother actually seduced Benjamin.\n\nAfter [[stalking]] her for several days and continuously proposing to her, Benjamin begins to make amends with Elaine. However, Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley after learning about the affair, confronts Benjamin at his rooming house, and threatens to put him behind bars if Benjamin sees his daughter again. Mr. Robinson then forces Elaine to drop out of college and takes her away to marry Carl, a classmate with whom she briefly had a relationship.\n\nReturning to Pasadena in search of Elaine, Benjamin breaks into the Robinson home but encounters Mrs. Robinson. She tells him he will not be able to stop the wedding with Carl and then calls the police, claiming that her house is being burglarized.\n\nBenjamin visits Carl's fraternity brothers who tell him that the wedding is in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] that morning. He rushes to the church and arrives just as Elaine is married, witnessing the kiss. He bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams \"Elaine!\" frantically. After hesitating, Elaine screams \"Ben!\" and looks at him pitifully. He rushes toward her, and a fight ensues as guests try to stop the two from leaving together. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who then slaps her. Benjamin manages to keep the guests at bay by picking up a large cross and wielding it, then jamming the church doors shut with it. Both he and Elaine then run into the street to flag down a passing bus and take the back seat, [[Elopement|eloping]].\n\nHowever, as they settle into their seats, their faces change from happiness to uncertainty as \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" plays.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Mrs. Robinson\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Benjamin Braddock\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Elaine Robinson\n* [[William Daniels]] as Mr. Braddock\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mr. Robinson\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Mrs. Braddock\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Room clerk\n* Brian Avery as Carl Smith\n* [[Walter Brooke]] as Mr. McGuire\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Mr. McCleery\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Mrs. Singleman\n* [[Marion Lorne]] as Miss DeWitte\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nNichols' first choice for Mrs. Robinson was French actress [[Jeanne Moreau]].<ref>The audio commentary by Mike Nichols and Steven Soderbergh in Criterion Collection BD and DVD.</ref> The idea behind this was that in the French culture, the \"older\" women tended to \"train\" the younger men in sexual matters (it is a cliche).

Other actors considered for the part included [[Claire Bloom]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Susan Hayward]], [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]], [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Simone Signoret]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Eleanor Parker]], [[Anne Baxter]] and [[Shelley Winters]]. [[Angela Lansbury]] also asked about playing the part. [[Ava Gardner]] sought the role of Mrs. Robinson, and reportedly called Nichols saying,\"I want to see you! I want to talk about this ''Graduate'' thing!\" Nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as Bancroft was 35 and Gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel. He later recounted that \"she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star clich\u00e9. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'\" Meanwhile, [[Natalie Wood]] turned down not only the role of Mrs. Robinson, but also that of Elaine.\n\nFor the character of Elaine, casting was also an issue. [[Patty Duke]] turned down the part as she did not want to work at the time. [[Faye Dunaway]] was also considered for Elaine, but had to turn it down, in favor of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. [[Sally Field]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] refused the role as well. [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Joan Collins]] both wanted the role, but did not succeed in getting it. [[Carroll Baker]] tested, but was said to have been too old to portray Anne Bancroft's daughter. [[Candice Bergen]] screen-tested as well, as did [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. Additionally, [[Ann-Margret]], [[Elizabeth Ashley]], [[Carol Lynley]], [[Sue Lyon]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Pamela Tiffin]], [[Julie Christie]], and [[Tuesday Weld]] were all on the director's shortlist before [[Katharine Ross]] was cast.\n\nWhen [[Dustin Hoffman]] auditioned for the role of Benjamin, he was just short of his 30th birthday at the time of filming. He was asked to perform a love scene with Ross, having previously never done one during his acting classes and believed that, as he said later, \"a girl like [Ross] would never go for a guy like me in a million years.\" Ross agreed, believing that Hoffman \"look[ed] about 3 feet tall ... so unkempt. This is going to be a disaster.\" Producer [[Joseph E. Levine]] later admitted that he at first believed that Hoffman \"was one of the messenger boys.\" Despite&mdash;or perhaps because of\u2014Hoffman's awkwardness, Nichols chose him for the film.<ref name=\"life19671124\">{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA71&pg=PA111#v=onepage&f=true| title=The Graduate| work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]| date=24 November 1967| accessdate=2014-03-03| last=Zeitlin| first=David| page=111}}</ref> \"As far as I'm concerned, Mike Nichols did a very courageous thing casting me in a part that I was not right for, meaning I was Jewish,\" said Hoffman. \"In fact, many of the reviews were very negative.

[[Susan Hayward]] was the first choice for Benjamin's mother, Mrs. Braddock, but the role was given to [[Elizabeth Wilson]]. And to play Mr. Braddock, [[Yul Brynner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] (who had been [[Governor of California]] for nearly a year when the film was released) all came close to getting the role that ended up going to [[William Daniels]].<ref name=kashner />\n\n===Filming locations===\nMany of the exterior university campus shots of Berkeley were actually filmed on the brick campus of [[University of Southern California|USC]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=USCfilming>{{cite web |title=USC's Lists & Urban Legends: Just a Few of the Feature Films Shot on the University Park Campus |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |last=Moore |first=Annette |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |date=Spring 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527071350/http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe church used for the wedding scene is actually the [[United Methodist Church]] in [[La Verne, California|La Verne]]. In a commentary audio released with the 40th anniversary DVD, Hoffman revealed that he was uneasy about the scene in which he pounds on the church window, as the minister of the [[Church (building)|church]] had been watching the filming disapprovingly. The wedding scene was highly influenced by the ending of the 1924 comedy film ''[[Girl Shy]]'' starring [[Harold Lloyd]], who also served as an advisor for the scene in ''The Graduate''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1443795|title=Silent Salon 2015 // Girl Shy|publisher=brownpapertickets.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctormacro.com/Movie%20Summaries/G/Girl%20Shy.htm|title=Girl Shy|publisher=doctormacro.com}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Graduate (soundtrack)}}\nThe film boosted the profile of [[folk-rock]] duo [[Simon & Garfunkel]].

He did play him a few notes of a new song he had been working on; \"It's not for the movie... it's a song about times past\u2014about [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Mrs. Roosevelt]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] and stuff.\" Nichols advised Simon, \"It's now about [[Mrs. Robinson]], not Mrs. Roosevelt.\"<ref name=bart>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/columns/the-perfect-pic-alignment-1117922805/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Peter |last=Bart |author-link=Peter Bart |title=The perfect pic alignment |date=May 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Graduate'' was met with generally positive reviews from critics upon its release.
