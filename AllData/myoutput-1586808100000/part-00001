Its name derives from a visit to the area by two [[Franciscan]] friars from [[Spain]], [[Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]] and [[Francisco Atanasio Dom\u00ednguez]] in 1776, who followed the stream down Spanish Fork canyon with the objective of opening a new trail from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], to the [[Spanish missions in California]], along a route later followed by fur trappers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} They described the area inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as having \"spreading meadows, where there is sufficient irrigable land for two good settlements. Over and above these finest of advantages, it has plenty of firewood and timber in the adjacent sierra which surrounds its many sheltered spots, waters, and pasturages, for raising cattle and sheep and horses.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nIn 1851, some settlers led by William Pace set up scattered farms in the Spanish Fork bottom lands and called the area the Upper Settlement.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\">Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 823</ref> However, a larger group congregated at what became known as the Lower Settlement just over a mile northwest of the present center of Spanish Fork along the [[Spanish Fork River]]. In December 1851, [[Stephen Markham]], who was severely wounded outside [[Carthage Jail]] in [[Carthage, Illinois]] while attempting to defend [[Joseph Smith]] and other church leaders from a mob in 1844, became the [[branch president|president]] of the first church congregation (branch) at the Lower Settlement.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\"/>\n\nIn 1852, Latter-day Saints founded a settlement called [[Palmyra, Utah|Palmyra]] west of the historic center of Spanish Fork. [[George A. Smith]] supervised the laying out of a townsite, including a temple square in that year.<ref>Jenson, Andrew. ''Encyclopedic History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''.

''Encyclopedic History''. p. 631</ref> Some of the people did not like this site and so moved to a different site at the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon, where they built a structure they called \"Fort St. Luke\".<ref>Jenson.

Its name derives from a visit to the area by two [[Franciscan]] friars from [[Spain]], [[Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]] and [[Francisco Atanasio Dom\u00ednguez]] in 1776, who followed the stream down Spanish Fork canyon with the objective of opening a new trail from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], to the [[Spanish missions in California]], along a route later followed by fur trappers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} They described the area inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as having \"spreading meadows, where there is sufficient irrigable land for two good settlements. Over and above these finest of advantages, it has plenty of firewood and timber in the adjacent sierra which surrounds its many sheltered spots, waters, and pasturages, for raising cattle and sheep and horses.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nIn 1851, some settlers led by William Pace set up scattered farms in the Spanish Fork bottom lands and called the area the Upper Settlement.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\">Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 823</ref> However, a larger group congregated at what became known as the Lower Settlement just over a mile northwest of the present center of Spanish Fork along the [[Spanish Fork River]]. In December 1851, [[Stephen Markham]], who was severely wounded outside [[Carthage Jail]] in [[Carthage, Illinois]] while attempting to defend [[Joseph Smith]] and other church leaders from a mob in 1844, became the [[branch president|president]] of the first church congregation (branch) at the Lower Settlement.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\"/>\n\nIn 1852, Latter-day Saints founded a settlement called [[Palmyra, Utah|Palmyra]] west of the historic center of Spanish Fork. [[George A. Smith]] supervised the laying out of a townsite, including a temple square in that year.<ref>Jenson, Andrew. ''Encyclopedic History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''.
