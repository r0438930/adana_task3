The village green is called \"The Forty\" and has a substantial and ancient walnut tree. [[Winterbrook]] was historically at the north end of the parish adjoining Wallingford and became within Wallingford parish (run by its Town Council) since 2015. [[Winterbrook Bridge]], which carries a by-pass road across the [[River Thames]], is in the parish.\n\nCholsey was one of the two main homes of the late author Dame [[Agatha Christie]] (the other being the village of [[Galmpton, Torbay|Galmpton]] on the south Devon coast). [[John Masefield]], poet laureate, lived in Cholsey.\nCholsey is a lovely village with bonnie collins in it.\n\n==History==\nA [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] site has been found beside the [[River Thames]] at Whitecross Farm in the northeast of the [[parish]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cromarty|Barclay|Lambrick|Robinson|2006|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2019}}</ref> A pre-[[Roman Britain|Roman]] road, the [[Icknield Way]], crosses the [[River Thames]] at Cholsey.\n\nA recent find has been a substantial Roman site in Celsea Place. Archaeologists discovered the best examples of corn dryers they have seen, with precision suggesting they were built by an engineer. Sites of burials and cremation pots have also been found. There is also part of a Roman villa, the majority of which appeared to have extended out under the existing road and houses and will have suffered significant unrecorded damage. The section of villa remaining within the archaeologically excavated area has been preserved in situ.\n\nThe village itself was founded on an island (\"[[Ceol of Wessex|Ceol's]] Isle\") in marshy ground close to the Thames. There is evidence that the [[House of Wessex]] royal family owned land in Cholsey in the 6th and 7th centuries. At this time the town was home to a [[Wilgyth|Saint Wilgyth]] who was [[veneration|venerated]] locally in [[Medieval|the Middle Ages]].\n\nA royal [[nunnery]], [[Cholsey Abbey]], was founded in the village in AD 986 by Queen Dowager [[\u00c6lfthryth, Queen of England|\u00c6lfthryth]] on land given by her son, King [[Ethelred the Unready]]. The nunnery is thought to have been destroyed by invading [[Viking|Danes]] in 1006 when they camped in Cholsey after setting nearby Wallingford ablaze. However, [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] [[masonry]] still survives in the [[Church of England parish church]] of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St Mary]]. Most of this [[flint]] and stone church was built in the 12th century. The church is cruciform.
