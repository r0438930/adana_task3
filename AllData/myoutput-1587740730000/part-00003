A large [[squall line]] formed and tracked through the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|mid-Atlantic]] on April 13, prompting more [[tornado warning]]s and [[Tornado watch|watches]]. Fifteen total watches were produced during the course of the event, two of which were designated [[Particularly Dangerous Situation]]s.\n\nThroughout the two-day outbreak, a total of 137&nbsp;tornadoes touched down across 10&nbsp;states, inflicting widespread and locally catastrophic damage. The strongest tornado occurred in southern Mississippi, producing estimated winds of {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, reaching a width of {{convert|2.25|mi|km|abbr=on}}, and causing eight deaths. With a total of 32 tornado-related fatalities, it was the deadliest tornado outbreak since [[tornado outbreak of April 27\u201330, 2014|April 27\u201330, 2014]]. To assist with recovery efforts, governors of five states declared a [[state of emergency]].

It first touched down along Price Road in [[Lawrence County, Mississippi]], east-southeast of the small community of [[Topeka, Mississippi|Topeka]]. Damage at the beginning of the path consisted of a few trees uprooted at EF0 strength. The tornado continued to the northeast, reaching EF2 intensity as it crossed Given Road, where a large swath of trees was flattened. EF2 damage continued to the northeast, with many large trees snapped and uprooted. A house along Rayborn Lane sustained EF1 roof damage, and two nearby sheds were damaged as well. The tornado strengthened further and reached EF3 strength as it moved through a wooded area near the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]], where numerous trees were snapped and partially debarked. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado passed northeast of [[Oak Vale, Mississippi|Oak Vale]] where some homes sustained roof and exterior wall loss, numerous trees were snapped, a metal building was destroyed, and damage was rated EF2 to EF3. Crossing into [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]], EF2 damage occurred in areas to the northeast of Oak Vale, where numerous trees and power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, homes sustained severe roof damage, and a mobile home was destroyed. A small area of EF3 damage occurred along Kirkley Lane, where some trees were denuded and partially debarked. A home and an outbuilding farther away from the center of the damage path sustained EF1 damage as well. Additional EF2 damage occurred to the west and north of [[Carson, Mississippi|Carson]], where a small business housed in a manufactured structure was completely destroyed, many trees were downed, and two well-built homes had their roofs torn off. EF2 damage continued to the northeast of Carson, where several mobile homes were destroyed, another house had its roof ripped off, and multiple other homes sustained less severe roof damage.<ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nCrossing [[Mississippi Highway 35]], the tornado again attained EF3 strength as the James Hill Church was completely leveled, a nearby home sustained collapse of its exterior walls, and trees were denuded and partially debarked. Multiple mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and power poles were snapped. Additional EF3-level tree damage occurred along Terrell Road before the tornado crossed into [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]]. EF3 tree damage again occurred along Three Notch Road, while a mobile home and two frame homes were destroyed nearby. The tornado weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 84]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees and destroying numerous chicken houses. As the tornado continued to the northeast, it produced EF1 to EF2 damage as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 49]] to the northwest of [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], downing many trees, some of which landed on homes and mobile homes. A small silo was blown over, outbuildings were destroyed, a mobile home was blown away and destroyed, and some houses sustained roof damage. Crossing Jones Chapel Road to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength, with damage limited to downed trees. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued through the northwestern corner of [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] and the southwestern corner of [[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]], and a church sustained some damage along this segment of the path as well. EF1 damage continued into [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], where a house and a chicken farm were damaged, and many trees were downed in and around the small community of [[Stringer, Mississippi|Stringer]]. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued along the remainder of the path and through the rural community of [[Paulding, Mississippi|Paulding]] until the tornado dissipated along County Road 31 to the south of [[Rose Hill, Jasper County, Mississippi|Rose Hill]].<ref name=\"JAN_0412\" /><ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nRemaining on the ground for {{convert|84.1|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}, this was the longest tracked-tornado of the outbreak.

The tornado began to grow in size and reached to EF1 intensity after crossing [[Georgia State Route 286|SR 286]] and moving into a neighborhood just southwest of [[Fashion, Georgia|Fashion]]. Exterior damage to homes became more severe, and numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. One home in this area had a large portion of its roof torn off. The tornado then downed a large swath of trees before crossing Norton Bridge Road, reaching EF2 strength. It then moved through the west side of Fashion, where the tornado obliterated at least eight double-wide manufactured homes along Deer Park Drive while damaging several others. Continuing north-northeast, additional manufactured homes were destroyed as the tornado paralleled [[Georgia State Route 225|SR 225]] and crossed Ridgeview Lane and Fieldview Court. The tornado then reached its peak intensity in this area as a recently built cell tower was blown over and crumpled at high-end EF2 intensity. The tornado maintained EF2 intensity as it moved directly into the southern part of the rural community of [[Sumac, Georgia|Sumac]] and crossed Zion Hill Church Road. A mobile home was destroyed in this area, a small frame home had its roof torn off and sustained partial exterior wall collapse, and numerous trees were snapped. A few other nearby homes sustained roof damage as well. The tornado then weakened slightly, but maintained EF2 intensity as it crossed SR 255 and moved through the central part of Sumac, where a house was destroyed and a few others sustained minor damage. It also heavily damaged a large metal chicken house in this area. The tornado then began to weaken and narrow as it continued north, where it destroyed or damaged multiple chicken houses along Jim Petty Road. Debris from these structures was scattered hundreds of yards away, and damage in this area was rated high-end EF1. The tornado weakened further as it continued to the north-northeast at EF0 strength, downing a few trees and causing minor damage to an outbuilding. EF0 damage continued as the tornado downed a few tree limbs along Halls Chapel Road, and then lifted just before reaching [[Sumac Ridge, Georgia|Sumac Ridge]] to the southwest of [[Cisco, Georgia|Cisco]].<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref>\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for 10 minutes, had a maximum width of 860 yards, and was given a rating of high-end EF2.

It quickly strengthened and impacted an industrial area on the south side of town at EF1 strength, damaging multiple businesses and metal buildings along [[Georgia State Highway 2|SR 2]]. A weather station at the Public Works Department measured an unconfirmed gust of {{convert|106|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in this area. As the tornado continued through Fort Oglethorpe, EF1 damage continued as a car wash was destroyed, a [[McDonald's]] was damaged, light poles were downed, and the front wall of a [[Sherwin-Williams]] paint store was blown in. Trees and tree limbs in Fort Oglethorpe were downed, and some homes and apartment buildings sustained roof damage. Thereafter, the tornado exited Fort Oglethorpe and continued to the northeast, weakening to EF0 intensity as it produced minor tree and roof damage. It then crossed [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|Intersate 75]] before moving into [[Tennessee]], entering the eastern neighborhoods and suburbs of [[Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"FFC_0415\"/> The tornado then strengthened to EF1 intensity again as it impacted the Harris Hills neighborhood, snapping and uprooting numerous trees in residential areas. It then crossed East Brainerd Road and became strong as it entered the Bella Vista Acres neighborhood of Chattanooga, where EF3 damage occurred. An auto-parts store in this area was leveled and a strip mall was severely damaged, with a [[barbecue]] restaurant on the east side of the building completely destroyed. A nearby doctor's office building was heavily damaged as well. Homes in residential areas along this segment of the path also sustained major structural damage. As the tornado continued northeast, a [[tornado emergency]] was issued for [[Collegedale, Tennessee|Collegedale]] and [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]]. The tornado then reached its peak width as it entered the Drake Forest neighborhood while still at EF3 intensity. Numerous well-built homes in this area had their roofs torn off and sustained collapse of their exterior walls, and numerous trees were snapped or denuded. EF2 to EF3 damage continued through the Holly Hills neighborhood where additional trees were snapped, power poles were downed, and many homes and apartment buildings sustained roof and exterior wall loss. The Grace Baptist Church was also significantly damaged, along with multiple buildings on the property. The tornado then abruptly narrowed and weakened back to EF1 strength as it moved through Collegedale and directly into [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]]. Many trees were damaged along this portion of the path, and multiple apartment buildings sustained roof damage as the tornado hit the Integra Hills Preserve Apartments. The tornado then weakened to EF0 strength as it crossed into [[Bradley County, Tennessee|Bradley County]] and over [[White Oak Mountain]], ultimately dissipated south of [[McDonald, Tennessee|McDonald]] around 11:33&nbsp;p.m. (03:33&nbsp;UTC).

It then moved northeast along the entire length of the Harbin Creek and strengthened as it moved directly into the rural community of [[Retreat, South Carolina|Retreat]]. Trees and homes in this area suffered EF0 to EF1 damage as the tornado crossed over [[South Carolina Highway 11|SC 11]] and [[South Carolina Highway 24|24]]. EF1 damage continued as the tornado approached the Coneross Creek. Damage rapidly became more severe and widespread as the tornado crossed the creek and moved into more populated areas in the southwestern part of [[Seneca, South Carolina|Seneca]]. Reaching EF3 strength, the tornado first struck a [[BorgWarner]] plant at the end of Evalona Drive, inflicting major structural damage to the facility and scattering large amounts of debris throughout the area. A security guard on the property was killed when a concrete-block guard shack was completely destroyed. A block-foundation house in this area was swept away at high-end EF3 strength, and a vehicle parked at this residence was blown into the basement. The large tornado then crossed the Wells Highway and moved through residential areas of Seneca. Many homes in this area sustained EF2 to EF3 damage, with roofs ripped off and exterior walls collapsed. Detached garages were destroyed, a gas station awning was shredded, and numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the path. The tornado had grown to a half\u2013mile wide at this point, and less severe damage was inflicted to numerous other homes in Seneca. Damage severity began to lessen as the tornado passed north of [[Utica, South Carolina|Utica]] and directly through the [[Jordania, South Carolina|Jordania]] community. Mainly EF1 damage was noted as dozens of homes were damaged along this segment of the path, and many large trees were snapped or uprooted, some of which landed on structures. The tornado maintained EF1 strength as it as it crossed [[US 123]] and continued to the northeast, where EF1 damage was inflicted to numerous trees. The tornado than crossed [[Hartwell Lake]] northwest of [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]] and produced some EF0 tree damage before lifting due-west of [[Central, South Carolina|Central]].\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for 14 minutes, traveled 16.66 miles, was 900 yards wide. Its final rating was high\u2013end EF3. There was one fatality, and numerous injuries ocurred.
