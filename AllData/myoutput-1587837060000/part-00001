It was released in Japan in March 2004, and in North America in September 2004. The game resulted from a school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory and was developed for less than {{USD}}1 million. In designing ''Katamari Damacy'', the development team led by [[Keita Takahashi]] aimed to maintain three key points: novelty, ease of understanding, and enjoyment.\n\nThe game's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the [[star]]s, [[constellation]]s, and [[Moon]], which were inadvertently destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly [[adhesive]] ball called a ''katamari'' around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great enough to become a star. ''Katamari Damacy''{{'s}} story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production.\n\nOverall, ''Katamari Damacy'' was well received in Japan and North America. The game was dubbed a [[sleeper hit]] and won several awards. The success of the game led to the creation of the ''[[Katamari]]'' franchise, and inspired the development of other video games. A high-definition remaster of the game, ''Katamari Damacy Reroll''{{efn|''Katamari Damacy Encore'' in Japan.}}, was released on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] in December 2018. Some critics have called it one of the [[greatest games of all time]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn a drunken stupor, an eccentric, god-like entity called the King of All Cosmos destroys all the stars, Earth's Moon and other such celestial bodies in the universe, save for Earth itself. Despite acknowledging his mistake, the King charges his 5-centimeter-tall son, the Prince, to go to [[Earth]] with a \"katamari\"\u2014a magical ball that allows anything smaller than it to stick to it and make it grow\u2014and collect enough material for him to recreate the stars and the Moon.  The Prince is successful, and the universe is returned to normal.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nA side-story follows the Hoshino family as the Prince works at his tasks.  The father, an [[astronaut]], is unable to go to the moon after it is wiped out by the King, and the daughter, whose name is Michiru, \"senses\" the Prince's work\u2014she can feel when each constellation returns to the sky.  Ultimately, the family, along with their house and town, are rolled up in the katamari that is used to remake the moon.<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Kata27.jpg|left|thumb|The \"Make A Star\" mode in ''Katamari Damacy'' is the primary mode, where the player must grow the ''katamari'' to a specific size (diameter) in a limited amount of time.]]\nThe player controls the Prince as he rolls the katamari around houses, gardens, and towns in order to meet certain parameters set by the King of All Cosmos.  The player uses the two [[analog stick]]s on the [[DualShock]] controller in a manner similar to the classic [[arcade game]] ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' to control the direction the katamari rolls.  Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed, flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari and more.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nObjects that are smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to determine if an object will stick to the katamari.  This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>  Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, and they can be rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked.  In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up to the point where the katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nThe typical mission given by the King of All Cosmos is the \"Make a Star\" mode, where the player needs to grow the katamari to a specific size within a given time frame. Other missions have more specific collecting rules, such as collecting as many items (swans, crabs, pairs) as possible within a given time, or collecting the largest item possible (such as a cow or bear).<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>  The player can attempt a [[score attack]] mode for any level, in which they try to make the largest katamari possible in the time allotted.  Certain levels can unlock an \"eternal mode\" by creating an exceptionally large katamari. In eternal modes, the player can explore the level with no time limit.<ref name=\"1up review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/katamari-damacy_6|title=Katamari Damacy (PS2)|website=[[1UP.com|1UP]]|first=Jeremy|last=Parish|date=2004-09-20|accessdate=2014-09-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721201850/http://www.1up.com/reviews/katamari-damacy_6|archivedate=2015-07-21}}</ref>\n\nEach level features two secret items that can be found. The first item is a ''royal present'' that contains an object that the Prince can wear. Most gifts are non-functional, but one includes a camera that can be used to take in-game screenshots.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>  The other secret item is a cousin of the Prince, which, once rolled up in main gameplay, can be used as a character in the various multiplayer modes. However, cousins can only be found and rolled up after the game is beaten. The game also tracks which objects the player has collected at any time, allowing them to review all the various objects within the game.\n\nIn the two-player mode, a player can choose to play as either the Prince or one of his numerous Cousins.  The screen is [[split screen (computer graphics)|split]] vertically; player one on the left and player two on the right. Players compete simultaneously in a small arena to collect the most objects within three minutes. The playing field is replenished with new objects periodically. Players can ram into each other, knocking items from their opponents' katamaris, and if one player leads by a fair amount, then it is possible to roll up the opponent's katamari.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Keita_Takahashi_-_2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Takahashi in 2005, with a plush version of the Prince from the game]]\n[[Keita Takahashi]] had studied art and entered the [[Musashino Art University]] to study sculpting in 1995.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = Keita's Mixed Media }}</ref> During his studies, he came to a philosophy that his art needed to combine practical elements along with a bit of whimsy and humor. After graduation, Takahashi no longer had the desire to pursue sculpting as a full-time career, and saw the potential to become involved in video games as a means to continue his art interest in a larger medium.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/> Joining Namco as an artist around 1999, Takahashi worked on a number of smaller projects for the publisher. One of these was called ''Action Drive'', inspired by ''[[Crazy Taxi]]'' but with more spy-based elements atop the driving gameplay. During this, Takahashi came up with the ideas of the characters that would be central to ''Katamari Damacy'': the King, the Queen, and the Prince of all Cosmos. His idea would have been that the queen had been kidnapped by agents on Earth, and the lazy King sends the Prince to rescue her. To do this, the player would use the diminutive Prince's head, shaped like a hammer, to stun humans, after which the Prince would then \"drive\" the humans around by putting a steering wheel on the back of the human's head. Takahashi felt this would lead to interesting and creative gameplay, allowing the player to create havoc as the Prince followed the misguided suggestions from the King, but the project leader rejected the idea. ''Action Drive'' was eventually cancelled.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/>\n\nWhile working on other projects, Takahashi continued to try to think of game ideas, seeking to grow beyond being just an artist for Namco. Takahashi cited two concepts that led to the inspiration of ''Katamari Damacy''. The first was a prototype shown by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] called ''Densen'' (Japanese for \"power line\") that had the player as a young girl traverse floating islands of various homes connected by power lines. The game, though never released, gave Takahashi the idea that the ordinary world could be made interesting with only small changes to perception, and that a game could be fun without the need to cause violence. The second idea was from the game of ''tamakorogashi'' played in Japanese school's ''und\u014dkai'' or [[sports day]]s. In ''tamakorogashi'', students attempt to push a giant ball into a goal.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = Katamari Takes Shape }}</ref><ref name=\"gamasutra keita\"/> Both those ideas led to him thinking of a game where spinning a ball would roll ordinary stuff into it, making the ball larger and larger over time. The evening he conceived of this idea, he spoke to a friend, one of the game designers in Namco, to see if it made for a good game idea, who agreed it had potential. The next day, he spoke to his former boss, Mitsutoshi Ozaki, about the concept, further adding a way to reuse the King and Prince characters he had previously proposed, who also agreed it would make for a great game.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nHowever, as Takahashi was in Namco's art department and not in game design, there was no easy route for him to propose this idea to Namco's superiors. Ozaki suggested a novel approach for Takahashi through the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory. At the time, Namco had been following in the model that [[Konami]] had used in 1997: Konami established the Konami Computer Entertainment School to help educate new game developers which were eventually hired in Konami, and several of the experimental ideas founded by the School during this time became products within the Konami Games & Music Division (later, [[Bemani]]) that were highly successful, including ''[[Beatmania]]'', ''[[GuitarFreaks]]'', and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/> Namco hoped the Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory would follow a similar path. At the time, [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] was principal of this school, and oversaw one senior thesis class where the students were being trained on 3D modeling towards producing a game prototype with the help of other Namco employees, which could potentially be made into a full game. Ozaki suggested to Takahashi that he could have the students of this class create the 3D objects needed to populate his game world.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/><ref name=\"Ref_2004\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/blog/content/kdpostmort.htm |title=The Singular Design of Katamari Damacy |work=Game Developer Magazine | date=December 2004 |accessdate=2014-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716185305/http://cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/blog/content/kdpostmort.htm |archivedate=2009-07-16}}</ref>\n\nTakahashi took Ozaki's advice, joining the project to help produce the prototype for his game. Alongside about ten students from the Digital Hollywood program, he had been able to gain some visual design artists from Namco to help with the prototype but had difficulty in getting any game development engineers, due to the low priority of the school. He was fortunate to find that some of the engineers from Namco's arcade game division were going to be laid off, and he was able to convince three of them to join his team to retain their jobs within Namco.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nOne initial difficulty faced in developing the prototype was their choice of platform, the [[PlayStation 2]]. At the time the project started, Sony had just announced the specifications for the console, which was built from the ground-up to support 3D graphics via the [[Emotion Engine]], but had not provided any updated [[software development kit]]s, believing that developers would be able to figure out the hardware, but resultantly made the console difficult to develop for at its launch.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> In contrast, [[Nintendo]] had recently announced the [[GameCube]] and that it would provide more developer-friendly features in contrast to the previous [[Nintendo 64]] console. Thus, Takahashi's team decided to develop for the GameCube for their prototype even though the final game was expected to be a PlayStation 2 release.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> In creating the prototype, Takahashi had envisioned that while the ball the player rolled around would grow as they rolled over objects, it would also shrink if they collided with obstacles and lost objects from it. This would have been tied to an interactive music track, which would have started off simple with a small ball and become more complex and full as it got larger. Technically, the team found they could not implement this shrinking mechanic due to memory limitations, and further found that with the interactive music concept, it was not fun to shrink back down and hear the music regress to a simpler form. The shrinking concept as well as the interactive music approach were subsequently dropped.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> The prototype was completed within about six months, in time for the year's [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] for exhibition. Takahashi also presented the game for an internal review, leading Namco to green light the game's full development.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nFull work on ''Katamari Damacy'' began in late 2001. Namco assigned [[Now Production]], based in [[Osaka]], to help bring the game to the PlayStation 2. Takahashi was initially concerned that having to work with an external studio in a different location, but found that the Namco and Now Production teams worked well together. The full team consisted of about twenty members between the two companies, and Namco had allocated a budget of about {{JPY|100 million}} (about {{USD|650,000-800,000}} at the time of production) for the game;<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> this was about the tenth of the cost of budget allocated for Namco's blockbuster titles such as ''[[Ridge Racer (video game)|Ridge Racer]]'' or ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]''.<ref name=\"gamespy iwatani\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/katamari-damashii/504503p1.html|title=Katamari Damashii: The Snowball Effect (PS2)|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|first=Steven|last=Kent|date=2004-04-08|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>  The full game took a year and a half to develop, with eight months of prototyping from the Digital Hollywood version.<ref name=\"gamasutra keita\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/postcard-sheffield.htm|title=Rolling the Dice: The Risks and Rewards of Developing Katamari Damacy|first=Brandon|last=Sheffield|date=2005-03-11 |website=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2008-08-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624031512/http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/postcard-sheffield.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2008-06-24}}</ref>\n\nTakahashi said that the team was aiming for four key points in developing the game: novelty, ease of understanding, enjoyment, and humor.<ref name=\"keita comments\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/595/595110p1.html|title=Keita Takahashi talks Katamari Damacy|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2005-03-10|accessdate=2008-08-13|first=Phil|last=Theobald}}</ref>  Iwatani compared the game to Namco's ''[[Pac-Man]]'', which focused on simplicity and innovation and served as a template for future games from the company.<ref name=\"gamespy iwatani\"/>  At one point during development, Takahashi \"proactively ignored\" advice from Namco to increase the complexity of the game.<ref name=\"keita comments\"/>\n\nThe core gameplay of ''Katamari Damacy'' is the subject of U.S. Patent 7,402,104, \"Game performing method, game apparatus, storage medium, data signal and program\".

The soundtrack was released in Japan as ''[[Music of the Katamari Damacy series#Katamari Damacy|Katamari Fortissimo Damacy]]''. Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences ([[Shibuya-kei]]).  Most of the tracks were composed by [[Yuu Miyake]], and many feature vocals from popular [[J-pop]] singers, such as [[Yui Asaka]] from the ''[[Sukeban Deka 3]]'' TV series, and [[anime]] [[voice actor]]s, including Nobue Matsubara and Ado Mizumori. One track is sung and written by [[Charlie Kosei]], composer of the ''[[Lupin III]]'' soundtrack.\n\n==Release==\nA single-level demonstration of the final version of ''Katamari Damacy'' was exhibited at the 2003 [[Tokyo Game Show]] (TGS). The demo was critically praised by the press, with [[GameSpot]]'s [[Jeff Gerstmann]] describing it as a \"good dose of weird fun\".<ref name=\"Gerstmann2003\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/katamaridamashii/news.html?sid=6075943&mode=all|title=TGS 2003: Katamari Damacy Impressions|website=GameSpot|first=Jeff|last=Gerstmann|date=2003-09-26|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> Sony expressed strong interest in pushing the game's release forward based on the TGS response, offering to handle the game's promotion in exchange.

''Katamari Damacy'' was first shown in the [[United States]] at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop during the March 2004 [[Game Developers Conference]]. A group of Western developers from the [[International Game Developers Association]] had previously brought ''[[Mojib-Ribbon]]'' to the 2003 Experimental Gameplay Workshop after seeing it demonstrated at the 2002 TGS, and had been at the 2003 TGS to look for a similar title to exhibit in 2004. Discovering ''Katamari Damacy'' as an ideal title to exhibit, the group arranged with Namco to have Takahashi come to the United States to present the game. The press reaction to the session was described as \"electric\", but they were disappointed to learn from Takahashi that there were no plans for a Western release.<ref name=\"bfb ch6\"/> Media attention to the game from the Workshop, often called \"Namco's snowball simulator\", led to more pressure on Namco for a Western release. Takahashi was again invited to come present the game at [[E3 2004]].<ref name=\"bfb ch6\"/> Players wanting the game to release in the West also wrote to Namco for a release. By July 2004, Namco officially announced the game's release in North America for September 2004.<ref name=\"Durham2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/07/20/katamari-damacy-official-in-us|title=Katamari Damacy Official in U.S.|website=IGN|first=Jeremy|last=Durham|date=2004-07-19|accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref> The game was never officially released in Europe, though its subsequent sequels would receive European releases.<ref name=\"bfb ch10\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = We Sell Katamari }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Japanese language]], {{nihongo|''Katamari''|[[wikt:\u584a|\u584a]]}} means \"clump\" or \"clod\" and ''Damashii'' is the [[rendaku]] form of {{nihongo|''tamashii''|[[wikt:\u9b42|\u9b42]]}} which means \"soul\" or \"spirit\".

Since its release, a number of designers have developed works inspired by ''Katamari'': one example is ''[[The Wonderful End of the World]]''.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Katamari}}\n''Katamari Damacy'' has spawned numerous sequels on the PlayStation 2 and newer game consoles. The game's direct sequel on the PlayStation 2, ''[[We Love Katamari]]'', was released internationally in 2005 and 2006. Its story is [[Self-reference|self-referential]], following on the success of the first game, most of the levels are based on requests from newfound fans of the King and the Prince. Though sharing the same mechanics, ''We Love Katamari'' introduces new gameplay features, such as co-operative play, and new goals, such as collecting the most valuable objects, that would continue through its sequels.\n\nOn July 29, 2012, the game was included in an exhibit at the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], entitled \"Century of the Child: Growing by Design\". Here, the game was used to demonstrate the change in toys and \"playthings\" over the 20th century, specifically praising the game for its \"quirky manipulations of scale\" that makes it accessible for all ages.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/07/30/katamari-damacy-featured-in-new-york-moma-exhibit.aspx | title = Katamari Damacy Featured In New York MoMA Exhibit | first = Jeff | last = Cork | date = July 30, 2012 | accessdate = 2012-07-31 | work = [[Game Informer]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/centuryofthechild/#/timeline/power-play/katamari-damacy-main-visual | title = Katamari Damacy | publisher = [[New York Museum of Modern Art]] | accessdate = July 31, 2012}}</ref> Vice president of marketing for Namco Bandai Games America, Inc.

It was released in Japan in March 2004, and in North America in September 2004. The game resulted from a school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory and was developed for less than {{USD}}1 million. In designing ''Katamari Damacy'', the development team led by [[Keita Takahashi]] aimed to maintain three key points: novelty, ease of understanding, and enjoyment.\n\nThe game's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the [[star]]s, [[constellation]]s, and [[Moon]], which were inadvertently destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly [[adhesive]] ball called a ''katamari'' around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great enough to become a star. ''Katamari Damacy''{{'s}} story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production.\n\nOverall, ''Katamari Damacy'' was well received in Japan and North America. The game was dubbed a [[sleeper hit]] and won several awards. The success of the game led to the creation of the ''[[Katamari]]'' franchise, and inspired the development of other video games. A high-definition remaster of the game, ''Katamari Damacy Reroll''{{efn|''Katamari Damacy Encore'' in Japan.}}, was released on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] in December 2018. Some critics have called it one of the [[greatest games of all time]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn a drunken stupor, an eccentric, god-like entity called the King of All Cosmos destroys all the stars, Earth's Moon and other such celestial bodies in the universe, save for Earth itself. Despite acknowledging his mistake, the King charges his 5-centimeter-tall son, the Prince, to go to [[Earth]] with a \"katamari\"\u2014a magical ball that allows anything smaller than it to stick to it and make it grow\u2014and collect enough material for him to recreate the stars and the Moon.  The Prince is successful, and the universe is returned to normal.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nA side-story follows the Hoshino family as the Prince works at his tasks.  The father, an [[astronaut]], is unable to go to the moon after it is wiped out by the King, and the daughter, whose name is Michiru, \"senses\" the Prince's work\u2014she can feel when each constellation returns to the sky.  Ultimately, the family, along with their house and town, are rolled up in the katamari that is used to remake the moon.<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Kata27.jpg|left|thumb|The \"Make A Star\" mode in ''Katamari Damacy'' is the primary mode, where the player must grow the ''katamari'' to a specific size (diameter) in a limited amount of time.]]\nThe player controls the Prince as he rolls the katamari around houses, gardens, and towns in order to meet certain parameters set by the King of All Cosmos.  The player uses the two [[analog stick]]s on the [[DualShock]] controller in a manner similar to the classic [[arcade game]] ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' to control the direction the katamari rolls.  Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed, flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari and more.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nObjects that are smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to determine if an object will stick to the katamari.  This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>  Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, and they can be rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked.  In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up to the point where the katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nThe typical mission given by the King of All Cosmos is the \"Make a Star\" mode, where the player needs to grow the katamari to a specific size within a given time frame.

The first item is a ''royal present'' that contains an object that the Prince can wear. Most gifts are non-functional, but one includes a camera that can be used to take in-game screenshots.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>  The other secret item is a cousin of the Prince, which, once rolled up in main gameplay, can be used as a character in the various multiplayer modes. However, cousins can only be found and rolled up after the game is beaten. The game also tracks which objects the player has collected at any time, allowing them to review all the various objects within the game.\n\nIn the two-player mode, a player can choose to play as either the Prince or one of his numerous Cousins.  The screen is [[split screen (computer graphics)|split]] vertically; player one on the left and player two on the right. Players compete simultaneously in a small arena to collect the most objects within three minutes. The playing field is replenished with new objects periodically. Players can ram into each other, knocking items from their opponents' katamaris, and if one player leads by a fair amount, then it is possible to roll up the opponent's katamari.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Keita_Takahashi_-_2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Takahashi in 2005, with a plush version of the Prince from the game]]\n[[Keita Takahashi]] had studied art and entered the [[Musashino Art University]] to study sculpting in 1995.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = Keita's Mixed Media }}</ref> During his studies, he came to a philosophy that his art needed to combine practical elements along with a bit of whimsy and humor. After graduation, Takahashi no longer had the desire to pursue sculpting as a full-time career, and saw the potential to become involved in video games as a means to continue his art interest in a larger medium.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/> Joining Namco as an artist around 1999, Takahashi worked on a number of smaller projects for the publisher. One of these was called ''Action Drive'', inspired by ''[[Crazy Taxi]]'' but with more spy-based elements atop the driving gameplay. During this, Takahashi came up with the ideas of the characters that would be central to ''Katamari Damacy'': the King, the Queen, and the Prince of all Cosmos. His idea would have been that the queen had been kidnapped by agents on Earth, and the lazy King sends the Prince to rescue her. To do this, the player would use the diminutive Prince's head, shaped like a hammer, to stun humans, after which the Prince would then \"drive\" the humans around by putting a steering wheel on the back of the human's head. Takahashi felt this would lead to interesting and creative gameplay, allowing the player to create havoc as the Prince followed the misguided suggestions from the King, but the project leader rejected the idea. ''Action Drive'' was eventually cancelled.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/>\n\nWhile working on other projects, Takahashi continued to try to think of game ideas, seeking to grow beyond being just an artist for Namco. Takahashi cited two concepts that led to the inspiration of ''Katamari Damacy''. The first was a prototype shown by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] called ''Densen'' (Japanese for \"power line\") that had the player as a young girl traverse floating islands of various homes connected by power lines. The game, though never released, gave Takahashi that the ordinary world could be made interesting with only small changes to perception, and that a game could be fun without the need to cause violence. The second idea was from the game of ''tamakorogashi'' played in Japanese school's ''und\u014dkai'' or [[sports day]]s. In ''tamakorogashi'', students attempt to push a giant ball into a goal.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = Katamari Takes Shape }}</ref><ref name=\"gamasutra keita\"/> Both those ideas led to him thinking of a game where spinning a ball would roll ordinary stuff into it, making the ball larger and larger over time. The evening he conceived of this idea, he spoke to a friend, one of the game designers in Namco, to see if it made for a good game idea, who agreed it had potential. The next day, he spoke to his former boss, Mitsutoshi Ozaki, about the concept, further adding a way to reuse the King and Prince characters he had previously proposed, who also agreed it would make for a great game.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nHowever, as Takahashi was in Namco's art department and not in game design, there was no easy route for him to propose this idea to Namco's superiors. Ozaki suggested a novel approach for Takahashi through the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory. At the time, Namco had been following in the model that [[Konami]] had used in 1997: Konami established the Konami Computer Entertainment School to help educate new game developers which were eventually hired in Konami, and several of the experimental ideas founded by the School during this time became products within the Konami Games & Music Division (later, [[Bemani]]) that were highly successful, including ''[[Beatmania]]'', ''[[GuitarFreaks]]'', and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/> Namco hoped the Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory would follow a similar path. At the time, [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] was principal of this school, and oversaw one senior thesis class where the students were being trained on 3D modeling towards producing a game prototype with the help of other Namco employees, which could potentially be made into a full game. Ozaki suggested to Takahashi that he could have the students of this class create the 3D objects needed to populate his game world.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/><ref name=\"Ref_2004\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/blog/content/kdpostmort.htm |title=The Singular Design of Katamari Damacy |work=Game Developer Magazine | date=December 2004 |accessdate=2014-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716185305/http://cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/blog/content/kdpostmort.htm |archivedate=2009-07-16}}</ref>\n\nTakahashi took Ozaki's advice, joining the project to help produce the prototype for his game. Alongside about ten students from the Digital Hollywood program, he had been able to gain some visual design artists from Namco to help with the prototype but had difficulty in getting any game development engineers, due to the low priority of the school. He was fortunate to find that some of the engineers from Namco's arcade game division were going to be laid off, and he was able to convince three of them to join his team to retain their jobs within Namco.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nOne initial difficulty faced in developing the prototype was their choice of platform, the [[PlayStation 2]]. At the time the project started, Sony had just announced the specifications for the console, which was built from the ground-up to support 3D graphics via the [[Emotion Engine]], but had not provided any updated [[software development kit]]s, believing that developers would be able to figure out the hardware, but resultantly made the console difficult to develop for at its launch.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> In contrast, [[Nintendo]] had recently announced the [[GameCube]] and that it would provide more developer-friendly features in contrast to it previous [[Nintendo 64]] console. Thus, Takahashi's team decided to develop for the GameCube for their prototype even though the final game was expected to be a PlayStation 2 release.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> In creating the prototype, Takahashi had envisioned that while the ball the player rolled around would grow as they rolled over objects, it would also shrink if they collided with obstacles and lost objects from it. This would have been tied to an interactive music track, which would have started off simple with a small ball and become more complex and full as it got larger. Technically, the team found they could not implement this shrinking mechanic due to memory limitations, and further found that with the interactive music concept, it was not fun to shrink back down and hear the music regress to a simpler form. The shrinking concept as well as the interactive music approach were subsequently dropped.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> The prototype was completed within about six months, in time for the year's [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] for exhibition. Takahashi also presented the game for an internal review, leading Namco to green light the game's full development.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nFull work on ''Katamari Damacy'' began in late 2001. Namco assigned [[Now Production]], based in [[Osaka]], to help bring the game to the PlayStation 2. Takahashi was initially concerned that having to work with an external studio in a different location, but found that the Namco and Now Production teams worked well together. The full team consisted of about twenty members between the two companies, and Namco had allocated a budget of about {{JPY|100 million}} (about {{USD|650,000-800,000}} at the time of production) for the game;<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> this was about the tenth of the cost of budget allocated for Namco's blockbuster titles such as ''[[Ridge Racer (video game)|Ridge Racer]]'' or ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]''.<ref name=\"gamespy iwatani\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/katamari-damashii/504503p1.html|title=Katamari Damashii: The Snowball Effect (PS2)|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|first=Steven|last=Kent|date=2004-04-08|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>  The full game took a year and a half to develop, with eight months of prototyping from the Digital Hollywood version.<ref name=\"gamasutra keita\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/postcard-sheffield.htm|title=Rolling the Dice: The Risks and Rewards of Developing Katamari Damacy|first=Brandon|last=Sheffield|date=2005-03-11 |website=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2008-08-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624031512/http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/postcard-sheffield.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2008-06-24}}</ref>\n\nTakahashi said that the team was aiming for four key points in developing the game: novelty, ease of understanding, enjoyment, and humor.<ref name=\"keita comments\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/595/595110p1.html|title=Keita Takahashi talks Katamari Damacy|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2005-03-10|accessdate=2008-08-13|first=Phil|last=Theobald}}</ref>  Iwatani compared the game to Namco's ''[[Pac-Man]]'', which focused on simplicity and innovation and served as a template for future games from the company.<ref name=\"gamespy iwatani\"/>  At one point during development, Takahashi \"proactively ignored\" advice from Namco to increase the complexity of the game.<ref name=\"keita comments\"/>\n\nThe core gameplay of ''Katamari Damacy'' is the subject of U.S. Patent 7,402,104, \"Game performing method, game apparatus, storage medium, data signal and program\".

The soundtrack was released in Japan as ''[[Music of the Katamari Damacy series#Katamari Damacy|Katamari Fortissimo Damacy]]''. Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences ([[Shibuya-kei]]).

One track is sung and written by [[Charlie Kosei]], composer of the ''[[Lupin III]]'' soundtrack.\n\n==Release==\nA single-level demonstration of the final version of ''Katamari Damacy'' was exhibited at the 2003 [[Tokyo Game Show]] (TGS).

''Katamari Damacy'' was first shown in the [[United States]] at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop during the March 2004 [[Game Developers Conference]]. A group of Western developers from the [[International Game Developers Association]] had previously brought ''[[Mojib-Ribbon]]'' to the 2003 Experimental Gameplay Workshop after seeing it demonstrated at the 2002 TGS, and had been at the 2003 TGS to look for a similar title to exhibit in 2004. Discovering ''Katamari Damacy'' as an ideal title to exhibit, the group arranged with Namco to have Takahashi come to the United States to present the game. The press reaction to the session was described as \"electric\", but were disappointed to learn from Takahashi that there were no plans for a Western release.<ref name=\"bfb ch6\"/> Media attention to the game from the Workshop, often called \"Namco's snowball simulator\", led to more pressure on Namco for a Western release. Takahashi was again invited to come present the game at [[E3 2004]].<ref name=\"bfb ch6\"/> Players wanting the game to release in the West also wrote to Namco for a release.

However, others, such as ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' reviewer Mark McDonald (who gave the game 8.5 out of ten with his EGM staff), argue that the game's limitations are made up for by its strengths: \"Sure, you're basically doing the same thing each mission, but Katamari's elegant controls, killer soundtrack, and wicked humor make it perfectly suited for replay.\"<ref name=EGM>{{cite journal|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/katamari-damacy_3|title=Katamari Damacy|first=Mark|last=McDonald|issue=185|date=November 2004|page=140|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|accessdate=2006-05-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509034310/http://www.1up.com/reviews/katamari-damacy_3|archivedate=2013-05-09}}</ref> As a well-executed, non-traditional game, ''Katamari Damacy'' has been influential in the game development community.

The game's direct sequel on the PlayStation 2, ''[[We Love Katamari]]'', was released internationally in 2005 and 2006. Its story is [[Self-reference|self-referential]], following on the success of the first game, most of the levels are based on requests from newfound fans of the King and the Prince. Though sharing the same mechanics, ''We Love Katamari'' introduces new gameplay features, such as co-operative play, and new goals, such as collecting the most valuable objects, that would continue through its sequels.\n\nOn July 29, 2012, the game was included in an exhibit at the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], entitled \"Century of the Child: Growing by Design\".
