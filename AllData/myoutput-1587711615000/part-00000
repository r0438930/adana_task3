Although it was a private library, scholars with references could access it. The purpose of ''Advice on Establishing a Library'' was to identify rules for private book collectors to organize their collections in a more orderly way to increase the collection's usefulness and beauty. Naud\u00e9 developed a classification system based on seven different classes: theology, medicine, jurisprudence, history, philosophy, mathematics and the humanities.

However, in general, classification systems can be divided into three types depending on how they are used:\n\n; Universal schemes: Covers all subjects, e.g. the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], [[Universal Decimal Classification]] and [[Library of Congress Classification]].\n; Specific classification schemes: Covers particular subjects or types of materials, e.g. [[Iconclass]] (art), [[British Catalogue of Music Classification]], and [[Dickinson classification]] (music), or the [[NLM Classification]] (medicine).\n; National schemes: Specially created for certain countries, e.g. the Swedish library classification system, SAB (Sveriges Allm\u00e4nna Biblioteksf\u00f6rening).\n\nIn terms of functionality, classification systems are often described as:\n\n; [[Enumeration|Enumerative]]: Subject headings are listed alphabetically, with numbers assigned to each heading in alphabetical order.\n; [[Hierarchy|Hierarchical]]: Subjects are divided hierarchically, from most general to most specific.\n; [[Faceted classification|Faceted]]/analytico-synthetic: Subjects are divided into mutually exclusive orthogonal facets.\n\nThere are few completely enumerative systems or faceted systems; most systems are a blend but favouring one type or the other. The most common classification systems, LCC and DDC, are essentially enumerative, though with some hierarchical and faceted elements (more so for DDC), especially at the broadest and most general level. The first true faceted system was the [[colon classification]] of [[S. R. Ranganathan]].\n\n==Methods or systems==\n\nClassification types denote the classification or categorization according to the form or characteristics or qualities of a classification scheme or schemes. Method and system has similar meaning. Method or methods or system means the classification schemes like Dewey Decimal Classification or Universal Decimal Classification. The types of classification is for identifying and understanding or education or research purposes while classification method means those classification schemes like DDC, UDC.\n \n===English language universal classification systems===\nThe most common systems in [[English language|English]]-speaking countries are:\n* [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC)\n* [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC)\n* [[Colon classification]] (CC)\n* [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC)\n\nOther systems include:\n* [[Harvard-Yenching Classification]], an English classification system for Chinese language materials\n* V-LIB 1.3 (2018 Vartavan Library Classification for over 700 fields of knowledge, based on the V-FRAME (http://projectis.co.uk/v-frame) and currently sold under license in the UK by PROJECTIS CONSULTANTS Ltd (http://projectis.co.uk/v-lib)\n* [[London Education Classification]] used at the [[UCL Institute of Education]]\n* [[Garside Classification Scheme]] used in most libraries of [[University College London]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/subject-support/garside-classification-scheme | title=Garside classification scheme &#124; Library Services - UCL \u2013 University College London| date=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Bliss bibliographic classification]] used in some British libraries\n\n===Non-English universal classification systems===\n* German [[:de:Regensburger Verbundklassifikation|Regensburger Verbundklassifikation]] (RVK)\n*A system of book classification for Chinese libraries (Liu's Classification) library classification for user\n**[[New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries]]\n* [[Nippon Decimal Classification]] (NDC)\n* [[Chinese Library Classification]] (CLC)\n* [[Korean Decimal Classification]] (KDC)\n* Russian [[:ru:\u0411\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f|Library-Bibliographical Classification]] (BBK)\n\n===Universal classification systems that rely on synthesis (faceted systems)===\n* [[Bliss bibliographic classification]]\n* [[Colon classification]]\n* [[Cutter Expansive Classification]]\n* [[Universal Decimal Classification]]\n\nNewer classification systems tend to use the principle of synthesis (combining codes from different lists to represent the different attributes of a work) heavily, which is comparatively lacking in LC or DDC.\n\n==The practice of classifying==\n\nLibrary classification is associated with library (descriptive) cataloging under the rubric of ''cataloging and classification'', sometimes grouped together as ''technical services''. The library professional who engages in the process of cataloging and classifying library materials is called a ''cataloger'' or ''catalog librarian''. Library classification systems are one of the two tools used to facilitate [[subject access]].  The other consists of alphabetical indexing languages such as Thesauri and Subject Headings systems.\n\nLibrary classification of a piece of work consists of two steps. Firstly, the subject or topic of the material is ascertained. Next, a call number (essentially a book's address) based on the classification system in use at the particular library will be assigned to the work using the notation of the system.\n\nIt is important to note that unlike subject heading or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work, in library classification systems, each work can only be placed in one class. This is due to shelving purposes: A book can have only one physical place. However, in classified catalogs one may have main entries as well as added entries. Most classification systems like the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC) and [[Library of Congress Classification]] also add a [[cutter number]] to each work which adds a code for the author of the work.\n\nClassification systems in libraries generally play two roles. Firstly, they facilitate [[subject access]] by allowing the user to find out what works or documents the library has on a certain subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iva.dk/bh/lifeboat_ko/concepts/subject_access_points.htm|title=Subject access points|work=iva.dk|access-date=2011-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531001950/http://www.iva.dk/bh/lifeboat_ko/CONCEPTS/subject_access_points.htm|archive-date=2011-05-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> Secondly, they provide a known location for the information source to be located (e.g. where it is shelved).\n\nUntil the 19th century, most libraries had closed stacks, so the library classification only served to organize the subject [[library catalog|catalog]]. In the 20th century, libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing.\n\nSome classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access, rather than for shelf location. For example, [[Universal Decimal Classification]], which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons, is more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects. Similarly [[faceted classification]] schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order.\n\nDepending on the size of the library collection, some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other. In extreme cases, a public library with a small collection might just use a classification system for location of resources but might not use a complicated subject classification system. Instead all resources might just be put into a couple of wide classes (travel, crime, magazines etc.). This is known as a \"mark and park\" classification method, more formally called reader interest classification.<ref>Lynch, Sarah N., and Eugene Mulero.

For example, in the Dewey classification 598.0944 concerns \"Birds in France\", the 09 signifies geographical division, and 44 represents France.\n* Hospitality: The degree to which the system is able to accommodate new subjects.\n* Brevity: The length of the notation to express the same concept.\n* Speed of updates and degree of support: The better classification systems are frequently being reviewed.\n* Consistency \n* Simplicity\n* Usability\n\n== See also ==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Attribute-value system]]\n* [[Categorization]]\n* [[Document classification]]\n* [[Knowledge organization]]\n* [[Library management]]\n* [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Library cataloging and classification|Library classification}}\n* {{cite book|last = Chan|first = L.

Similarly [[faceted classification]] schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order.\n\nDepending on the size of the library collection, some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other. In extreme cases, a public library with a small collection might just use a classification system for location of resources but might not use a complicated subject classification system. Instead all resources might just be put into a couple of wide classes (travel, crime, magazines etc.). This is known as a \"mark and park\" classification method, more formally called reader interest classification.<ref>Lynch, Sarah N., and Eugene Mulero.

For example, in the Dewey classification 598.0944 concerns \"Birds in France\", the 09 signifies geographical division, and 44 represents France.\n* Hospitality: The degree to which the system is able to accommodate new subjects.\n* Brevity: The length of the notation to express the same concept.\n* Speed of updates and degree of support: The better classification systems are frequently being reviewed.\n* Consistency \n* Simplicity\n* Usability\n\n== See also ==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Attribute-value system]]\n* [[Categorization]]\n* [[Document classification]]\n* [[Knowledge organization]]\n* [[Library management]]\n* [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Library cataloging and classification|Library classification}}\n* {{cite book|last = Chan|first = L.
