Its home games are played at [[Modern Woodmen Park]] (formerly John O'Donnell Stadium) in [[Davenport, Iowa]], one of the [[Quad Cities]].\n\n==History==\nBeginning in 1879, Quad City area professional baseball has a history that includes three teams.  Davenport, Moline ([[Moline Plowboys]]) and Rock Island ([[Rock Island Islanders]]) all have hosted [[minor league baseball]] teams. A fourth area team played in nearby [[Kewanee, Illinois]]. The 1879 Davenport Brown Stockings, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Bid McPhee]],  finished 5-15 in the Northwestern League. The Brown Stockings played with the Dubuque Red Stockings, Omaha Green Stockings and Rockford White Stockings, before the Northwestern League folded after one season. The Davenport Onion Weeders (1888), Davenport Hawkeyes (1889) and Davenport Pilgrims (1891) played before the turn of the 20th century in the [[Western Association]] (1888), [[Central Interstate League]] (1889) and the [[Illinois-Iowa League]] (1891).<ref name=\"baseball-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/ |title=Minor League Baseball History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?id=9db35b65|title=1879 Northwestern League|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/l-NWES1/y-1879|title=1879 Northwestern League (NL) on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Northwestern_League|title=Northwestern League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Western_Association|title=Western Association - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, the [[Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League]] or \"Three-I League\" was founded, with the Davenport River Rats and Rock Island Islanders as charter members. This Davenport team set the foundation of the franchise that exists today. Other charter members of the 1901 Three-I League were the [[Bloomington Blues]], [[Cedar Rapids Rabbits]], [[Decatur Commodores]], [[Evansville River Rats]], Rockford Red Sox and [[Terre Haute Hottentots]]. The Davenport franchise changed monikers frequently in the early years, playing as the Davenport River Rats (1901\u201304), Davenport Riversides (1905), Davenport  Knickerbockers (1906), Davenport  Prodigals (1909\u201312) and [[Davenport Blue Sox]] (1913\u20131916). The Davenport Blue Sox won the 1914 Three-I League Championship.\n<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" />\n\nThe third Quad City area team was added In July, 1914. The [[Danville Speakers]] of the Three-I League relocated to Moline and the [[Moline Plowboys]] were established. The Moline Plowboys won Three-I League Championships in 1915, 1921 and 1937. A fourth area team, the nearby [[Kewanee Boilermakers]], were members of the Class C [[Central Association]] (1908-1913 and 1948-1949). Kewanee won the 1949 Central Association Championship as the Kewanee A's, affiliates of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1948-1949) after Moline relocated to Kewanee in mid-season 1948. The Moline Plowboys/Moline A's were affiliates of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1922), [[St Louis Browns]] (1931\u201332), [[Chicago Cubs]] (1937\u201340) and the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1947\u201348). The Rock Island Islanders were affiliates of the [[St. Louis Browns]] (1932) and [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1933).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kewanee,_IL|title=Kewanee, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Moline,_IL|title=Moline, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Rock_Island_Islanders|title=Rock Island Islanders - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter folding in 1916, the Davenport Blue Sox resumed play in 1929. On May 26, 1931, the Davenport Blue Sox moved into newly built Municipal Stadium, nicknamed the \"Muny.\" The Davenport Blue Sox played in the [[Mississippi Valley League]] (1929\u20131933) and [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]] (1934\u20131937). The Blue Sox were an affiliate of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1936-1937).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_Blue_Sox|title=Davenport Blue Sox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Rock Island Islanders and Davenport Blue Sox faced each other in the Mississippi Valley League Championship series in both 1932 and 1933. Rock Island won the 1932 Championship in six games. Davenport defeated the Islanders to win the 1933 Championship in the final season of the Mississippi Valley League. The 1933 Blue Sox were led by Ed Hall's 151 RBI and [[Como Cotelle]]'s .407 average. The 1936 Blue Sox continued the strong decade, winning the 1936 [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]] Championship.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=fitzpa002joh John Fitzpatrick Minor League Statistics & History] Baseball-Reference.com</ref>\n\nThe 1933 Davenport Blue Sox were ranked in [[The National Baseball Association's top 100 minor league teams]] (#58).

The Rock Island Islanders franchise folded on July 7 1937. The Western League itself then folded after the season, leaving Davenport without a team until 1946. The Rock Island Islanders franchise never played again. The Moline A's (1947-1948) moved to become the [[Kewanee A's]] (1948-1949), who folded permanently along with the Central Association in 1949. Moline played home games at [[Browning Field]] and Rock Island at [[Douglas Park (Rock Island)|Douglas Park]].

The Davenport Cubs (1946-1947) rejoined the Class B [[Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League]] (Three-I League) as an affiliate of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. Led by future MLB players [[Roy Smalley, Jr.|Roy Smalley]] and [[Rube Walker]], the 1946 Davenport Cubs won the regular season pennant.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\">Rask, Tim; Baseball at John O'Donnell Stadium (2004) Arcadia Publishing; {{ISBN|0-7385-3247-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=b26d1c3a |title=1946 Davenport Cubs Statistics \u2013 Minor Leagues |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref> \n\nThe Davenport Pirates (1948-1949) were an affiliate of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].

The Pirates swept Evansville, 3-0, to win the 1949 Three-I League Championship.

The Davenport Tigers (1951-1952) were an affiliate of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1951-1952). [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Jim Bunning]] pitched for the 1951 Davenport Tigers and [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] announcer [[Milo Hamilton]] was the Tigers' announcer on radio. [[Harvey Kuenn]] played for the 1952 tigers, hitting .340. Kuehn was called up to the Detroit Tigers after the 1952 Davenport season ended. Kuenn won the 1953 [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=2ca0259a |title=1952 Davenport Tigers Statistics \u2013 Minor Leagues |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/broadcaster-milo-hamilton-dies/c-150122950|title=Hall of Fame broadcaster Milo Hamilton dies|website=MLB.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1952 season, Davenport folded. They were replaced by the [[Peoria Chiefs]] in the 1953 Three-I League. Davenport remained without a team for four seasons. The 1957 Davenport DavSox (1957-1958) rejoined the Three-I League as an affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1957-1958). The 1958 DavSox advanced to the Three-I Championship series, where they were defeated by the [[Cedar Rapids Braves]] 3  games to 2. The 1958 season would be the last for Davenport in the Three-I League.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=6003a38a |title=1959 Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three-I_League|title=Three-I League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_DavSox|title=Davenport DavSox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\n===Midwest League:1960\u2013present===\nDespite finishing third in the league in attendance (61,522), the DavSox moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] after the 1958 season to become the [[Lincoln Chiefs]] (who drew 44,783 in the 1959 Three-I League) . This left Davenport without a team for the 1959 season. As a result, local businessman Hugo \"Hooks\" Kohn started a drive to bring a new team to Davenport. Hooks Kohn was a local baseball enthusiast and a leading pioneer/player of \"Diamond Ball\", a Davenport game that evolved into today's [[softball]]. With Kohn heading the '''Quad City Baseball Fans Association''', a team was secured for the 1960 season as a [[Milwaukee Braves]] affiliate, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Travis Jackson]] to serve as the 1960 Manager. The Quad City Baseball Fans Association would oversee operation of the Davenport franchise from 1960 through 1986.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/news/a-field-of-history/article_1f510730-2029-5b92-b576-1befeb2c0e36.html|title=A field of history|first=John Willard / QUAD-CITY|last=TIMES|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref><ref>http://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/article_776f9300-55a4-11df-99bc-001cc4c03286.html Q-C reaches 50 years in the Midwest League]</ref><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nThe 1960 [[Davenport Braves]] became a member of the fledgling [[Midwest League]], a partnership that has continued without interruption in seven decades.

The creation of the [[Midwest League]] essentially ended the Three-I, which folded after the 1961 season.

In 1962, The Quad City Angels became an affiliate of the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]]. The affiliate change was occurred because Cedar Rapids, also a Braves affiliate, was one of six former Three-I teams that joined the Midwest League in 1962 when the Three-I folded. Thus began a lengthy frnchise affiliation with the Angels. The Quad City Angels of 1963 and 1964 were managed by [[Chuck Tanner]] and the 1964 Angels became the first Midwest League franchise to draw more than 100,000 fans in a season.

The franchise generally used the nickname of its major-league affiliate from 1946 through the 1991 season. This changed in 1992, when the team created its own nickname in a \"name the team' contest. The contest winning name was: \"Quad City River Bandits\" and from 1992 through the 2003 the team kept this name. On October 20, 2003, the team was renamed the \"Swing of the Quad Cities\"; after another \"name the team\" contest was held. However, On December 13, 2007, returned to the \"Quad Cities River Bandits\" after voters in a third contest chose the River Bandits name over \"The Swing\" and four other finalists: \"Channel Cats\", \"The Current\",  \"River Eagles\", and \"Talons.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Quad Cities River Bandits (press release)|title=The Fans Have Spoken: 'River Bandits' Returns to the Quad Cities|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4317/|date=2007-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThe renaming of the Bandits has proven to be one of sports\u2019 most successful rebranding campaigns \u2013 merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.\n\n[[File:Modern Woodmen Park 2.jpg|left|thumb|Modern Woodmen Park 2]]\n\n===History of franchise ownership===\nAfter success in securing a Midwest League Franchise for Davenport beginning with the 1960 season, the non-profit Quad City Baseball Fans Association continued to operate the franchise from 1960 to 1986. In 1986 [[Chicago]] businessman [[Harry H. Semrow]] purchased the team from the association for $350,000, but Semrow was forced to sell after the 1987 season due to poor health. \n\nRichard Holtzman, another Chicago businessman who owned as many as five minor league teams, purchased the franchise from Semrow and remained as owner from 1987 until 1998. In 1998, Holtzman sold the team to Seventh Inning Stretch, a company owned by Kevin Krause, a businessman out of [[Mason City, Iowa]], and son of [[Kum & Go]] co-founder William Krause.\n\nOn December 28, 2006, Krause agreed to sell the team to [[Florida]]-based Main Street Baseball for an undisclosed price; the sale was completed on November 29, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Batterson|title=Florida Group Buys Swing of Q-C|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2006/12/29/news/local/doc4594b96650622371753668.txt|work=[[Quad-City Times]]|date=2006-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Swing of the Quad Cities (press release)|title=It's official: Main Street Iowa completes purchase of Swing|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4313/|date=2007-11-29}}</ref>\n\nUnder Main Street Baseball's ownership, led by Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt, the River Bandits sparked a stunning resurgence of baseball in the Quad Cities, winning league championships in 2011 and 2013, setting new attendance records and capturing numerous awards for their innovative promotions.<ref name=\"milb.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20071220&content_id=41529816&sid=t565&vkey=team4|title=Dave Heller's Bio &#124; Quad Cities River Bandits About<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>\n\nSince Heller and Herrfeldt took over the Bandits, sponsorship sales, suite sales, ticket sales, and concession sales have all seen annual increases. The team's average attendance in its first year under Main Street rose by more than 56%, the largest such increase in baseball, and has climbed to nearly 3,700 fans per game. The Bandits have also led one of sports' most successful rebranding campaigns \u2013 merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009!), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.\n\nMain Street Baseball has also been a trail-blazer, having hired the Midwest League's only female general manager (Stefanie Brown) then hiring the only African-American GM in minor league baseball. The River Bandits have also consistently had more women in leadership positions than most any team in baseball, and are the only minor league club to have won back-to-back Diversity Economic Impact Engagement (DEIE) Scholarships from major league baseball since MLB started awarding them in 2012.\n\nThe River Bandits have been voted Best Family Entertainment by the Quad-City Times for each of the past five years and were recently voted by the River Cities Reader as \"The Best Place for An Inexpensive Date that Doesn't Look Like It.\" The team won the prestigious \"Golden Bobblehead\" award in 2013 for best charitable promotion in Minor League Baseball for its innovative \"Photo Jersey Auction\" to benefit Autism Awareness. It also won a \"Veeckie Award\" from ESPN in 2009 for best minor league promotion (\"Tattoo Night\") and the \"Promotion of the Year\" Award from Ballpark Digest the same year for the team's \"Mega-Candy Drop\", as well as a Gold Award from the U.S. Army for its community service. The team has also won repeated awards for Heller's creative TV and radio ads, which have repeatedly been recognized as among the best in the industry.<ref name=\"milb.com\"/>\n\n==The ballparks==\nEarly Davenport teams played Sunday games on Sullivan Island outside of town, presumably to avoid Sunday activity laws.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/venues/v-675|title=Fairgrounds Park in Davenport, IA history and teams on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Davenport teams of 1901\u20131916, ending with the Davenport Blue Sox, played at '''Davenport Base Ball Park'''. It was also called \"Blue Sox Stadium\". The ballpark was located at Bowditch & Second Streets, or Third Street & Telegraph Road in Davenport, Iowa.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/venues/v-676|title=Davenport Base Ball Park in Davenport, IA history and teams on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Blue_Sox_Stadium|title=Blue Sox Stadium - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Davenport Blue Sox of 1929 and 1930 played at '''Fairgrounds Park''', located within the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds in Davenport, Iowa. the ballpark was also known as \"Blue Sox Ball Park.\" The ballpark had a capacity of 5,500 (1929). Located at West Locust & North Clark Street, with an address of with an address of 2815 West Locust Street Davenport, Iowa. The Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds are still in use today.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mvfair.com/|title=Home &#124; Mississippi Valley Fair|website=mvfair.com}}</ref>\n\nPlaying at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds, the city of Davenport realized a stadium was needed. The city preferred a [[Mississippi River]] riverfront location near downtown and a lighted stadium. Subsequently, the Davenport Levee Commission proposed a new, lighted, brick stadium along the Davenport riverfront.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOn May 26, 1931, the new Municipal Stadium opened. It is still the franchise ballpark today. With a site on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], the new stadium was constructed entirely with local labor for a total construction cost $165,000. It had light towers (first night game was June 4, 1931) with the grandstand facing the Mississippi River. Municipal Stadium was fondly nicknamed \"The Muny.\" In 1971, Municipal Stadium was renamed '''John O'Donnell Stadium''' after the longtime sports editor of the ''[[Quad-City Times]]''. Over time, the ballpark has shown its unique view, versatility and staying power, continuing to host baseball today as [[Modern Woodmen Park]].<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mwlguide.com/cities/davenport/park.html |title=Davenport's Modern Woodmen Park |publisher=MWLguide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.delcotimes.com/news/hallowed-grounds-top-classic-minor-league-ballparks/article_d088d232-1d57-5f3f-8ef9-d7c98e1712d3.html|title=Hallowed grounds: Top 10 classic minor league ballparks|first=The|last=Highwayman|website=The Delaware County Daily Times}}</ref>\n\nMany baseball events have been held at the Stadium through the years. Some of historical note:\n* Hosting eight [[Midwest League]] All-Star Games in six different decades: 1964, 1968, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1990, 2006 and 2011\n* The [[Davenport Blue Sox]] had several exhibitions against [[Negro League]] teams in the 1930s.\n* The Major League [[St. Louis Browns]] played the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a 1942 exhibition game.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/>\n\n[[File:Joshua Hill (baseball player).jpg|thumb|Joshua Hill, (2003)]]\n\n===Modern Woodman Park renovations===\nSitting on the banks of the river, the stadium has survived many floods, including major [[Mississippi River floods]] of 1965, 1969, 1993 and 2001, all of which breached the facility. Pictures of the flooded stadium are plentiful in the news media. The [[Great Flood of 1993]] was especially damaging to the facility.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/floods-are-big-part-of-ballpark-s-legacy/article_97e8b50f-2990-5a31-be66-5d1190ec0f3c.html|title=Floods are big part of ballpark's legacy|first=Don|last=Doxsie|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref>\n\nDesigned to combat the recurring and costly toll of flooding, a project was undertaken in 2004 to modernize and protect the facility in a joint effort of The River Bandits and the City of Davenport. The result was a massive redesign of the field and grounds at [[Modern Woodmen Park]]. The entire structure and field of the original 1931 stadium were redone. Only the exterior fa\u00e7ade of the old stadium remained, with concessions, concourses, level loge boxes, and seating areas being reconstructed. The improvements essentially created a new ballpark within the shell of the old park. The resulting 2004 renovations included a raised playing field; a slight shift of the playing field to better face the river; removal of the drive behind the outfield fence; the addition of a berm in the outfield and the addition of exterior brick/metal columns, put in place for decoration and also to hold portable flood walls to be inserted outside the stadium. The new protections secured and protected the facility during other major [[Mississippi River floods]] in 2008, 2011 and 2013. Before the 2004 renovations, flooding created financial and logistical problems, as the team was regularly forced to move \"home\" games to local facilities or other MWL venues such as [[Clinton, Iowa]], [[North Scott High School]], Brady Street Stadium or [[Black Hawk College]].<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe ballpark has incorporated modern and creative features.

plays in the [[Midwest League]]. Its home games are played at [[Modern Woodmen Park]] (formerly John O'Donnell Stadium) in [[Davenport, Iowa]], one of the [[Quad Cities]].\n\n==History==\nBeginning in 1879, Quad City area professional baseball has a history that includes three teams.  Davenport, Moline ([[Moline Plowboys]]) and Rock Island ([[Rock Island Islanders]]) all have hosted [[minor league baseball]] teams. A fourth area team played in nearby [[Kewanee, Illinois]]. The 1879 Davenport Brown Stockings, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Bid McPhee]],  finished 5-15 in the Northwestern League. The Brown Stockings played with the Dubuque Red Stockings, Omaha Green Stockings and Rockford White Stockings, before the Northwestern League folded after one season. The Davenport Onion Weeders (1888), Davenport Hawkeyes (1889) and Davenport Pilgrims (1891) played before the turn of the 20th century in the [[Western Association]] (1888), [[Central Interstate League]] (1889) and the [[Illinois-Iowa League]] (1891).<ref name=\"baseball-reference\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/ |title=Minor League Baseball History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?id=9db35b65|title=1879 Northwestern League|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/l-NWES1/y-1879|title=1879 Northwestern League (NL) on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Northwestern_League|title=Northwestern League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Western_Association|title=Western Association - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, the [[Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League]] or \"Three-I League\" was founded, with the Davenport River Rats and Rock Island Islanders as charter members. This Davenport team set the foundation of the franchise that exists today. Other charter members of the 1901 Three-I League were the [[Bloomington Blues]], [[Cedar Rapids Rabbits]], [[Decatur Commodores]], [[Evansville River Rats]], Rockford Red Sox and [[Terre Haute Hottentots]]. The Davenport franchise changed monikers frequently in the early years, playing as the Davenport River Rats (1901\u201304), Davenport Riversides (1905), Davenport  Knickerbockers (1906), Davenport  Prodigals (1909\u201312) and [[Davenport Blue Sox]] (1913\u20131916). The Davenport Blue Sox won the 1914 Three-I League Championship.\n<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" />\n\nThe third Quad City area team was added In July, 1914. The [[Danville Speakers]] of the Three-I League relocated to Moline and the [[Moline Plowboys]] were established. The Moline Plowboys won Three-I League Championships in 1915, 1921 and 1937. A fourth area team, the nearby [[Kewanee Boilermakers]], were members of the Class C [[Central Association]] (1908-1913 and 1948-1949). Kewanee won the 1949 Central Association Championship as the Kewanee A's, affiliates of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1948-1949) after Moline relocated to Kewanee in mid-season 1948. The Moline Plowboys/Moline A's were affiliates of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1922), [[St Louis Browns]] (1931\u201332), [[Chicago Cubs]] (1937\u201340) and the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] (1947\u201348). The Rock Island Islanders were affiliates of the [[St. Louis Browns]] (1932) and [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1933).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kewanee,_IL|title=Kewanee, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Moline,_IL|title=Moline, IL - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Rock_Island_Islanders|title=Rock Island Islanders - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter folding in 1916, the Davenport Blue Sox resumed play in 1929. On May 26, 1931, the Davenport Blue Sox moved into newly built Municipal Stadium, nicknamed the \"Muny.\" The Davenport Blue Sox played in the [[Mississippi Valley League]] (1929\u20131933) and [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]] (1934\u20131937). The Blue Sox were an affiliate of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1936-1937).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_Blue_Sox|title=Davenport Blue Sox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Rock Island Islanders and Davenport Blue Sox faced each other in the Mississippi Valley League Championship series in both 1932 and 1933. Rock Island won the 1932 Championship in six games. Davenport defeated the Islanders to win the 1933 Championship in the final season of the Mississippi Valley League. The 1933 Blue Sox were led by Ed Hall's 151 RBI and [[Como Cotelle]]'s .407 average. The 1936 Blue Sox continued the strong decade, winning the 1936 [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]] Championship.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=fitzpa002joh John Fitzpatrick Minor League Statistics & History] Baseball-Reference.com</ref>\n\nThe 1933 Davenport Blue Sox were ranked in the [[The National Baseball Association's top 100 minor league teams]] (#58).

The Rock Island Islanders franchise folded on July 7 1937. The Western League itself then folded after the season, leaving Davenport without a team until 1946. The Rock Island Islanders franchise never played again. The Moline A's (1947-1948) moved to become the [[Kewanee A's]] (1948-1949), who folded permanently along with the Central Association in 1949. Moline played home games at [[Browning Field]] and Rock Island at [[Douglas Park (Rock Island)|Douglas Park]]. Both Browning Field and Douglas Park are in use today.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref name=\"baseball-reference\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Western_League|title=Western League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kewanee_A%27s|title=Kewanee A's - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter a nine-season baseball hiatus during [[World War II]], baseball returned to Davenport in 1946. The Davenport Cubs (1946-1947) rejoined the Class B [[Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League]] (Three-I League) as an affiliate of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. Led by future MLB players [[Roy Smalley, Jr.|Roy Smalley]] and [[Rube Walker]], the 1946 Davenport Cubs won the regular season pennant.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\">Rask, Tim; Baseball at John O'Donnell Stadium (2004) Arcadia Publishing; {{ISBN|0-7385-3247-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=b26d1c3a |title=1946 Davenport Cubs Statistics \u2013 Minor Leagues |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref> \n\nThe Davenport Pirates (1948-1949) were an affiliate of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].  [[Bob Purkey]], [[Frank Thomas (outfielder)|Frank Thomas]] and future [[Cy Young Award]] Winner [[Vern Law]] were on the 1949 Pirates. The Pirates swept Evansville, 3-0, to win the 1949 Three-I League Championship. In 1949 Davenport drew 133,505 fans, a franchise record that would stand until 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/about/page.jsp?ymd=20090224&content_id=514556&vkey=about_t565&fext=.js |title=pre-1960s &#124; MiLB.com About &#124; The Official Site of Minor League Baseball |publisher=Milb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref>\n\nRemaining in the Three-I League, the 1950 Davenport Quads operated as an Independent team. The Davenport Tigers (1951-1952) were an affiliate of the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1951-1952). [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Jim Bunning]] pitched for the 1951 Davenport Tigers and [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] announcer [[Milo Hamilton]] was the Tigers' announcer on radio. [[Harvey Kuenn]] played for the 1952 tigers, hitting .340. Kuehn was called up to the Detroit Tigers after the 1952 Davenport season ended. Kuenn won the 1953 [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=2ca0259a |title=1952 Davenport Tigers Statistics \u2013 Minor Leagues |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/broadcaster-milo-hamilton-dies/c-150122950|title=Hall of Fame broadcaster Milo Hamilton dies|website=MLB.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1952 season, Davenport folded. They were replaced by the [[Peoria Chiefs]] in the 1953 Three-I League. Davenport remained without a team for four seasons. The 1957 Davenport DavSox (1957-1958) rejoined the Three-I League as an affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1957-1958). The 1958 DavSox advanced to the Three-I Championship series, where they were defeated by the [[Cedar Rapids Braves]] 3  games to 2. The 1958 season would be the last for Davenport in the Three-I League.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=6003a38a |title=1959 Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Three-I_League|title=Three-I League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Davenport_DavSox|title=Davenport DavSox - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\n===Midwest League:1960\u2013present===\nDespite finishing third in the league in attendance (61,522), the DavSox moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] after the 1958 season to become the [[Lincoln Chiefs]] (who drew 44,783 in the 1959 Three-I League) . This left Davenport without a team for the 1959 season. As a result, local businessman Hugo \"Hooks\" Kohn started a drive to bring a new team to Davenport. Hooks Kohn was a local baseball enthusiast and a leading pioneer/player of \"Diamond Ball\", a Davenport game that evolved into today's [[softball]]. With Kohn heading the '''Quad City Baseball Fans Association''', a team was secured for the 1960 season as a [[Milwaukee Braves]] affiliate, with [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Travis Jackson]] to serve as the 1960 Manager. The Quad City Baseball Fans Association would oversee operation of the Davenport franchise from 1960 through 1986.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/news/a-field-of-history/article_1f510730-2029-5b92-b576-1befeb2c0e36.html|title=A field of history|first=John Willard / QUAD-CITY|last=TIMES|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref><ref>http://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/article_776f9300-55a4-11df-99bc-001cc4c03286.html Q-C reaches 50 years in the Midwest League]</ref><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nThe 1960 [[Davenport Braves]] became a member of the fledgling [[Midwest League]], a partnership that has continued without interruption in seven decades. The 1960 Davenport Braves joined the [[Waterloo Hawks]], [[Keokuk Cardinals]], [[Dubuque Packers]], [[Clinton C-Sox]], [[Kokomo Dodgers]], [[Quincy Giants]] and [[Decatur Commodores]] to form the 8-team 1960 Midwest League. The creation of the [[Midwest League]] essentially ended the Three-I, which folded after the 1961 season. In its long history, the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League hosted teams in 31 cities.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=373abb77 1960 Midwest League Statistics] Baseball-Reference.com</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/midwest-league/era-comes-to-close-for-q-c-minor-league-baseball/article_6bb44a98-44f1-11de-b57e-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Era comes to close for Q-C minor league baseball|first=Steve|last=Batterson|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the franchise permanently dropped \"Davenport\" and became the \"Quad City\" Braves. In 1962, The Quad City Angels became an affiliate of the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]]. The affiliate change was occurred because Cedar Rapids, also a Braves affiliate, was one of six former Three-I teams that joined the Midwest League in 1962 when the Three-I folded. Thus began a lengthy frnchise affiliation with the Angels. The Quad City Angels of 1963 and 1964 were managed by [[Chuck Tanner]] and the 1964 Angels became the first Midwest League franchise to draw more than 100,000 fans in a season. The Quad City Angels won the 1968 and 1971 Midwest League titles.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTFA9XC7D4UC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=quad+city+baseball+fans+association&source=bl&ots=HQ4x2AbKWG&sig=5cxzXezcfICO2JU6D5Hxdn1-w2E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GHnYUIC0KcH0qAHslYDoAg&ved=0CHEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=quad+city+baseball+fans+association&f=false|title=Baseball at Davenport's John O'Donnell Stadium|first=Tim|last=Rask|date=March 10, 2004|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|via=Google Books}}</ref> <ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=a292d12e 1971 Quad Cities Angels Statistics \u2013 Minor Leagues] Baseball-Reference.com</ref>\n\nThe Angels affiliation ran from 1962 through the 1992 season, minus the six-year affiliation with the [[Chicago Cubs]] (1979\u201384), with the [[Quad Cities Cubs]] winning the 1979 Midwest League Championship.

The franchise generally used the nickname of its major-league affiliate from 1946 through the 1991 season. This changed in 1992, when the team created its own nickname in a \"name the team' contest.

In 1986 [[Chicago]] businessman [[Harry H. Semrow]] purchased the team from the association for $350,000, but Semrow was forced to sell after the 1987 season due to poor health. \n\nRichard Holtzman, another Chicago businessman who owned as many as five minor league teams, purchased the franchise from Semrow and remained as owner from 1987 until 1998. In 1998, Holtzman sold the team to Seventh Inning Stretch, a company owned by Kevin Krause, a businessman out of [[Mason City, Iowa]], and son of [[Kum & Go]] co-founder William Krause.\n\nOn December 28, 2006, Krause agreed to sell the team to [[Florida]]-based Main Street Baseball for an undisclosed price; the sale was completed on November 29, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Batterson|title=Florida Group Buys Swing of Q-C|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2006/12/29/news/local/doc4594b96650622371753668.txt|work=[[Quad-City Times]]|date=2006-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Swing of the Quad Cities (press release)|title=It's official: Main Street Iowa completes purchase of Swing|url=http://www.swingbaseball.com/news/story/4313/|date=2007-11-29}}</ref>\n\nUnder Main Street Baseball's ownership, led by Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt, the River Bandits sparked a stunning resurgence of baseball in the Quad Cities, winning league championships in 2011 and 2013, setting new attendance records and capturing numerous awards for their innovative promotions.<ref name=\"milb.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20071220&content_id=41529816&sid=t565&vkey=team4|title=Dave Heller's Bio &#124; Quad Cities River Bandits About<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>\n\nSince Heller and Herrfeldt took over the Bandits, sponsorship sales, suite sales, ticket sales, and concession sales have all seen annual increases. The team's average attendance in its first year under Main Street rose by more than 56%, the largest such increase in baseball, and has climbed to nearly 3,700 fans per game. The Bandits have also led one of sports' most successful rebranding campaigns \u2013 merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009!), sponsorships jumped more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top eight in minor league baseball.\n\nMain Street Baseball has also been a trail-blazer, having hired the Midwest League's only female general manager (Stefanie Brown) then hiring the only African-American GM in minor league baseball. The River Bandits have also consistently had more women in leadership positions than most any team in baseball, and are the only minor league club to have won back-to-back Diversity Economic Impact Engagement (DEIE) Scholarships from major league baseball since MLB started awarding them in 2012.\n\nThe River Bandits have been voted Best Family Entertainment by the Quad-City Times for each of the past five years and were recently voted by the River Cities Reader as \"The Best Place for An Inexpensive Date that Doesn't Look Like It.\" The team won the prestigious \"Golden Bobblehead\" award in 2013 for best charitable promotion in Minor League Baseball for its innovative \"Photo Jersey Auction\" to benefit Autism Awareness. It also won a \"Veeckie Award\" from ESPN in 2009 for best minor league promotion (\"Tattoo Night\") and the \"Promotion of the Year\" Award from Ballpark Digest the same year for the team's \"Mega-Candy Drop\", as well as a Gold Award from the U.S. Army for its community service.

The city preferred a [[Mississippi River]] riverfront location near downtown and a lighted stadium. Subsequently, the Davenport Levee Commission proposed a new, lighted, brick stadium along the Davenport riverfront.<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOn May 26, 1931, the new Municipal Stadium opened. It is still the franchise ballpark today. With a site on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], the new stadium was constructed entirely with local labor for a total construction cost $165,000. It had light towers (first night game was June 4, 1931) with the grandstand facing the Mississippi River. Municipal Stadium was fondly nicknamed \"The Muny.\" In 1971, Municipal Stadium was renamed '''John O'Donnell Stadium''' after the longtime sports editor of the ''[[Quad-City Times]]''. Over time, the ballpark has shown its unique view, versatility and staying power, continuing to host baseball today as [[Modern Woodmen Park]].<ref name=\"Rask, Tim 2004\"/><ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mwlguide.com/cities/davenport/park.html |title=Davenport's Modern Woodmen Park |publisher=MWLguide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.delcotimes.com/news/hallowed-grounds-top-classic-minor-league-ballparks/article_d088d232-1d57-5f3f-8ef9-d7c98e1712d3.html|title=Hallowed grounds: Top 10 classic minor league ballparks|first=The|last=Highwayman|website=The Delaware County Daily Times}}</ref>\n\nMany baseball events have been held at the Stadium through the years.

Pictures of the flooded stadium are plentiful in the news media. The [[Great Flood of 1993]] was especially damaging to the facility.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/professional/minor/floods-are-big-part-of-ballpark-s-legacy/article_97e8b50f-2990-5a31-be66-5d1190ec0f3c.html|title=Floods are big part of ballpark's legacy|first=Don|last=Doxsie|website=The Quad-City Times}}</ref>\n\nDesigned to combat the recurring and costly toll of flooding, a project was undertaken in 2004 to modernize and protect the facility in a joint effort of The River Bandits and the City of Davenport. The result was a massive redesign of the field and grounds at [[Modern Woodmen Park]]. The entire structure and field of the original 1931 stadium were redone. Only the exterior fa\u00e7ade of the old stadium remained, with concessions, concourses, level loge boxes, and seating areas being reconstructed. The improvements essentially created a new ballpark within the shell of the old park. The resulting 2004 renovations included a raised playing field; a slight shift of the playing field to better face the river; removal of the drive behind the outfield fence; the addition of a berm in the outfield and the addition of exterior brick/metal columns, put in place for decoration and also to hold portable flood walls to be inserted outside the stadium. The new protections secured and protected the facility during other major [[Mississippi River floods]] in 2008, 2011 and 2013. Before the 2004 renovations, flooding created financial and logistical problems, as the team was regularly forced to move \"home\" games to local facilities or other MWL venues such as [[Clinton, Iowa]], [[North Scott High School]], Brady Street Stadium or [[Black Hawk College]].<ref name=\"charliesballparks1\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe ballpark has incorporated modern and creative features.
