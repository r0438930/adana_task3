It is complemented by [[Get Help]], a feature introduced in [[Windows 10]] that enables the user to contact Microsoft directly but does not allow for remote desktoping or screen sharing.\n\nBefore Quick Assist has been introduced in Windows 10,  [[Windows XP]] and later Windows versions offered a similar feature called '''Windows Remote Assistance'''.\n\n==Overview==\nHelpers offering remote assistance can open multiple simultaneous sessions\u2014one for each remote computer. However, users seeking assistance from helpers can have only one RA session waiting for a connection. Connect invitations can be sent to multiple recipients\u2014any of which may connect. All subsequent connect attempts will be blocked until the first helper disconnects, after which another helper may connect. If the user disconnects the session, the RA application terminates and no further connections are allowed.\n\nQuick Assist is installed by default on Windows clients, but is not available on [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] servers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Remote Assistance and Resulting Internet Communication in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee126163%28v=ws.10%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396|website=TechNet|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref> The name of the tool differs depending on Windows language, search for \u201cQuick Assist\u201d in the Start menu will locate the tool regardless of the language settings.\n\nQuick Assist requests a code in order to match users to a session.
