It is about an 11-year-old girl and her best friend Tico, a female [[orca]].\n\nUnlike the other series in Nippon Animation's ''[[World Masterpiece Theater]]'' line, ''Tico of the Seven Seas'' is an entirely original story. An English dub of the series, entitled ''Tico & Friends'', was produced by [[Ocean Productions|Ocean Studios]]. The dubbed series makes two significant alterations to the original Japanese series; the secondary protagonist Tico and the main antagonist Adrienne Bennex, survive while their original counterparts die. Some violent, bloody and death scenes are also edited out.\n\n==Plot==\nNanami Simpson is a young Japanese-American girl. Having lost her mother when was young, she now to lives with her marine biologist father, Scott Simpson, on board his research vessel, the ''Peperonchino''. Scott has been in search of a creature known as the Luminous Whale, a whale that can glow brightly underwater, for many years and is determined to eventually see it and preserve it's exsistence. Nanami also is close friends with an orca named Tico, who was rescued as a baby just before Nanami was born. The two have an unbreakable bond and swim with each other every day. As a result, Nanami gradually learns to hold her breath longer and swim deeper than other humans can. \n\nScott's search from the Luminous Whale soon puts him at odds with the Gaiatron Corporation, a greedy research conglomerate led by the ruthless and ambitious Adrienne Benex, who wishes to exploit the creature for a rare element it seemingly carries in its body. Aiding Benex are her right-hand man, Gaulois, and Dr. Charles LeConte, an old acquaintance of Scott's who is obsessed with the Luminous Whale.\n\nTogether, Nanami, Scott, and Tico, along with Scott's first-mate and right-hand man, Al Andretti, look to locate the Luminous Whale before Benex and Gaiatron can. As their journey goes on, they are joined by new crew members:\n* Cheryl Melville, an English-American heiress looking for adventure.\n* James McIntyre, Cheryl's loyal butler.\n* Thomas LeConte, Dr. LeConte's introverted and lonely, but intelligent son, who wishes to prove himself capable in the real world.\n* Junior, Tico's calf, born nearly halfway through the series.\n\nAs the journey goes on, the crew of ''Peperonchino'' encounter and make both new friends and enemies as they race against the corrupt Benex and Gaiatron to find the Luminous Whale first.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n; Nanami Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Megumi Hayashibara]]; [[Chantal Strand]] in the English dub\n: Nanami is the main protagonist in the series. At 11-years old, she claims all from the sea are her friends. She has been friends with Tico ever since she was a baby, and has a close relationship with her father Scott, and friendships with all of their crew members throughout the series.\n\n; Tico\n: A [[killer whale]] who is a life-long friend to Nanami. In the Japanese version, she dies freeing Al's submersible from an iceberg crevice, which mortally injures her, and her body sinks to the depths of the sea, while Nanami looks on helplessly. In the last episode, \"The Shining Circle\" her spirit reunites with Nanami and her son via the Luminous Whale. In the English dub, she is still injured, but survives and the crew is forced to leave her behind to let her recover. She returns a few episodes later, shortly after her son Junior leaves the crew to join a super-pod of killer whales. In the final episode, the spirit that Tico reunites with turns out to be her own long-lost mother.\n\n; Junior\n: Junior is Tico's calf. In the Japanese original series, he takes Tico's place as Nanami's companion, along with her name, after the former sacrifices herself to save Al. He meets his mother again the series finale, \"The Shining Circle\". In the English dub, his mother survives, and is left behind to recover, returning not long after he leaves to join a super-pod of killer whales.\n\n; Scott Simpson\n: Voiced by [[Shuuichi Ikeda]]; [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] in the English dub\n: Nanami's father, who is a marine biologist, and captain of the ''Peperoncino''. He has been searching for the Luminous Whale for seven years. He is a dedicated father to his daughter and is often the level-headed one for his crew. Scott is also very protective of his research of the Luminous Whale, refusing to let it or the creature itself fall into the wrong hands.\n\n; Alfonso \"Al\" Andretti\n: A fat Italian man who works with Scott, and always on the lookout for treasure. He is the chef and engineer of ''Peperoncino'' and often comes up with get-rich quick schemes in order to make the crew money. He serves as something of an uncle and mentor to Nanami and later to Thomas as well. A scene where he punches Professor LeConte in the stomach is removed.\n\n; Cheryl Christina Melville\n: Voiced by [[Venus Terzo]] in the English dub.\n: An English-American woman who comes from a wealthy family and craves adventure. She initially has a frosty relationship with the crew, particularly Nanami and Al (due to her joining the crew on a whim, and her initial reluctance to due any actual work), but they all soon warm up to her, and she ends up becoming a valued member and even something of a big sister to Nanami and Thomas. Due to her wealth, she often serves as the source for emergency funds when the crew needs them. Initially, she relies on her butler James to do the crew work for her, but later starts contributing by herself following his brief departure from the crew in the seventh episode, and becomes more independent as a result.\n\n; James McIntyre\n: Voiced by David Kaye in the English dub\n: Cheryl's loyal butler. Born near the Cliffs of Dover, he has served the Melville family faithfully for many years, and is charged with looking after Cheryl while she attends college in New York. James joins the crew of the ''Peperoncino'' at the same time as Cheryl, but leaves in the seventh episode and joins the crew of the Gaiatron ship ''Scorpio'', after switching places with Thomas LeConte. He returns to the ''Peperoncino'' ten episodes later, and remains with the crew up to the series finale.\n\n; Thomas LeConte\n: A boy the ''Peperoncino'' crew met in the Bahamas and the son of scientist Dr. Charles LeConte. Intelligent and computer-savvy, but also introverted, lonely, and somewhat cautious, he craves attention from his father, but is often pushed aside and neglected due to Dr. LeConte's research regarding the Luminous Whale. In his first appearance in the second episode, he cons Nanami and Al in helping him return to his ship in return for a treasure map that turns out to be fake. Several episodes later, the crew meets him again on his father's ship, and after being rescued after getting trapped underwater in the ''Peperoncino'''s mini-sub, he decides to join their crew to go out into the world and become more extroverted, becoming Al's unofficial apprentice and Nanami's closest human friend. By the end of the series, he mananges to patch things up with his father.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n; Nagisa Suzuki\n: Nanami's aunt from her mother, Yuko's side of the family.\n\n; Gayle\n: A con-man with a heart of gold, and a crush on Cheryl. He also has a fear of fish.\n\n; Richard\n: A free-lance photographer who informs the ''Peperoncino'' crew about Metal Claw's activities.\n\n; Lolo\n: Richard's pet parrot.\n\n; Metal Claw\n: Voiced by [[Daisuke Gouri]]; [[Scott McNeil]] in the English dub\n: A villain from the earlier part in the series, he is a man who has a metal hand in place of his right hand. Captain of the ''Mentil''.\n\n; Professor Charles LeConte\n: A scientist who is an old acquaintance of Scott Simpson, and Thomas's father. Obsessed with the Luminous Whale, LeConte's determination to find it causes him to ally himself with the corrupt Gaiatron Corporation, and neglect his son. By the end of the series, however, he learns the error of his ways and reconciles with Thomas. A scene where he slaps his son is edited out in the English Dub.\n\n; Stephen\n: A member of the crew on the ''Scorpio''.\n\n; Topia\n: Voiced by [[Akiko Yajima]]\n\n; Enrico Andretti\n: Voiced by [[Bin Shimada]]\n: A cousin of Al's, who lives with their 94-year-old grandmother.\n\n; Don Gould (Mr. Krang in the English dub)\n: Head of the Rio Connection.\n\n; Rozalint\n: Voiced by [[Hisako Ky\u014dda]]\n\n; Adrienne Benex\n: Voiced by [[Chiyoko Kawashima]]\n: The main villain of the series. Professor LeConte's superior, she owns the Gaiatron Corporation. She wants the luminous whale due to an element it is said to have, called trontium. In the Japanese series, she is killed when seagulls attack and incapacitate the pilots of her escape helicopter, causing it to crash into her Antarctic Base, The Iron City, with her in it. The seagulls were summoned, along with other animals, by the luminous whale to attack the base. This is edited out in the English dub.\n\n; Gaulois\n: Voiced by [[Keisuke Yamashita]]\n: Benex's underling.\n\n; Terry Taft\n: Voiced by [[Yumi T\u014dma]]\n: A wheelchair-bound boy Nanami meets.

It is semi-supernatural, as it summoned animals to attack the iron city base, showed Nanami her future, and brought the Ghost of Tico for a final Goodbye to her friend and Son. It can still die though, as evidence by its fossils being found by Scott Simpson, and it almost drying up when hoisted out of the Ocean by Adrienne Bennex's men.\n\n==Staff==\n* '''Produced by''' Koichi Motohashi\n* '''Production Management:''' Juichi Motohashi\n* '''Planning:''' Kenji Shimizu, Shoji Sato\n* '''Character Design:''' Satoko Morikawa\n* '''Art Setting by''' Kazue It\u00f4\n* '''Art Director:''' Shigeru Morimoto\n* '''Director of Photography:''' Toshiaki Morita\n* '''Music by''' [[Michiru \u014cshima]]\n* '''Sound Director:''' Sadayoshi Fujino\n* '''Producers:''' Yoshihiro Suzuki, Akio Yogo\n* '''Directed by''' Jun Takagi\n* '''Produced by''' [[Fuji TV]], [[Nippon Animation]]\n\n===English dub===\n* '''Voices:''' [[Lisa Ann Beley]], Don Brown, [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]], [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]], [[Andrew Francis]], [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]], [[Scott McNeil]], John Payne, [[Chantal Strand]], [[Venus Terzo]], [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]\n\n==Episodes==\n# Nanami, A Little Adventurer (''The Girl With the Killer Whale!
