It serves as the project's international [[lead single]] and her debut release with [[Universal Motown]]. It was co-written by American songwriter [[Rico Love]], who described the song as a \"fun and aggressive club record\" with themes of female empowerment and lyrics with deliberate grammatical errors. French disc jockeys and producers [[David Guetta]] and [[Sandy Vee]] produced \"Commander\" with [[synthesizer|synthesized]] [[dance music|dance]] beats that blend [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with [[electronica]] and [[house music]]. Rowland and Guetta had previously topped charts around the world with a similar dance production, \"[[When Love Takes Over]]\", in 2009. The song was premiered at the 2010 ''[[Winter Music Conference]]'' and subsequently garnered acclaim from contemporary critics for Rowland's vocal performance as well as Guetta's musical production.\n\nJust over a month after release, it topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and later peaked within the top-ten in the United Kingdom and top-twenty in Ireland and New Zealand. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named \"Commander\" the number-one summer jam of 2010 and named by [[Fitness Magazine]] as one of The Top 100 Workout Songs of 2010. The song was nominated at the [[International Dance Music Awards]] for Best R&B/Urban Dance Track. An accompanying music video was directed by Masashi Muto, and portrays Rowland facing herself in various [[dance competition|dance-off]] scenes. Promotion for the release included performing the song live on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]] and ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''. The Extended Dance Mix, also produced by Guetta, was released alongside the main single worldwide, whereas the urban remix with American rapper [[Nelly]] was released in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n== Background and context ==\n[[File:David Guetta One Love Tour M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Guetta during a DJ set on his One Love World Tour]]\nIn 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for \"When Love Takes Over\", the media reported that [[Columbia Records]] and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a233039/kelly-rowland-old-label-dumped-me.html |title=Kelly Rowland \"Old Label Dumped Me\" |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |work=[[Digital Spy]] |last=Copsey |first=Robert |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> However in a 2010 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Rowland stated the decision to leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record ''[[Ms. Kelly]]'' did not sell sufficiently well.

It serves as the project's international [[lead single]] and her debut release with [[Universal Motown]]. It was co-written by American songwriter [[Rico Love]], who described the song as a \"fun and aggressive club record\" with themes of female empowerment and lyrics with deliberate grammatical errors. French disc jockeys and producers [[David Guetta]] and [[Sandy Vee]] produced \"Commander\" with [[synthesizer|synthesized]] [[dance music|dance]] beats that blend [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with [[electronica]] and [[house music]]. Rowland and Guetta had previously topped charts around the world with a similar dance production, \"[[When Love Takes Over]]\", in 2009. The song was premiered at the 2010 ''[[Winter Music Conference]]'' and subsequently garnered acclaim from contemporary critics for Rowland's vocal performance as well as Guetta's musical production.\n\nJust over a month after release, it topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and later peaked within the top-ten in the United Kingdom and top-twenty in Ireland and New Zealand. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named \"Commander\" the number-one summer jam of 2010 and named by [[Fitness Magazine]] as one of The Top 100 Workout Songs of 2010. The song was nominated at the [[International Dance Music Awards]] for Best R&B/Urban Dance Track. An accompanying music video was directed by Masashi Muto, and portrays Rowland facing herself in various [[dance competition|dance-off]] scenes. Promotion for the release included performing the song live on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]] and ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''. The Extended Dance Mix, also produced by Guetta, was released alongside the main single worldwide, whereas the urban remix with American rapper [[Nelly]] was released in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n== Background and context ==\n[[File:David Guetta One Love Tour M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Guetta during a DJ set on his One Love World Tour]]\nIn 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for \"When Love Takes Over\", the media reported that [[Columbia Records]] and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a233039/kelly-rowland-old-label-dumped-me.html |title=Kelly Rowland \"Old Label Dumped Me\" |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |work=[[Digital Spy]] |last=Copsey |first=Robert |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> However in a 2010 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Rowland stated the decision to leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record ''[[Ms. Kelly]]'' did not sell sufficiently well. After the release of \"When Love Takes Over\" she would go on to fire [[Mathew Knowles]].<ref name=\"EW interview\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Kelly Rowland \"My Old Label Dumped Me & Why I Had to Fire Matthew\" |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |issue=1109 |pages=43\u201345}}</ref> It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow [[Destiny's Child]] singer [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]]. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video (\"[[Why Don't You Love Me (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles song)|Why Don't You Love Me]]\") from her album ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' just before Rowland released \"Commander\" was unfair on Rowland.<ref name=\"kelly vs beyonce\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tmf.nl/artiesten/nieuws/101778/kelly_rowland_vs_beyonc.html |title=Kelly Rowland vs Beyonce |language=Dutch |publisher=[[The Music Factory|TMF]] |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2010-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prosieben.de/stars-lifestyle/news/kelly-rowland-hat-keinen-zoff-mit-beyonce-knowles-1.1681535/ |title=Kelly Rowland has no qualms with Beyonc\u00e9 |language=German |publisher=Prosieben.com |last=F. |first=I. |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2010-05-11}}</ref> These claims would be denied by the singer who said that despite the clip for \"Why Don't You Love Me\" airing several days before \"Commander\", the media was \"making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn't exist.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a218870/kelly-rowland-denies-beyonce-rivalry.html |title=Kelly Rowland denies Beyonc\u00e9 rivalry |publisher=Hachette Filipacchi UK |work=Digital Spy |last=Minaya |first=Marcell |date=2010-05-08 |accessdate=2010-05-11}}</ref> She also said, \"we all came out at the same time and it really doesn't matter&nbsp;...
