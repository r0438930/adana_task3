The word Durger means 'invincible' in several Northern Indian languages, and could be an allusion to the ruggedness of the Duggar terrain and the historically militarized and autonomous Dogra societies. In Himachal, Dogri is majorly spoken in Hamirpur, Barsar, Una, Chintpurni, Kangra, and Bilaspur regions.\n\nIn 1976, the experts attending the Language Session of the 'All India Oriental Conference' held in Dharwad, [[Karnataka]], could not reach consensus on the 'Dwigart' and 'Durger' hypotheses, but did manage agreement on a Doonger-Duggar connection. In a subsequent 'All India Oriental Conference' held at [[Jaipur]] in 1982, the linguists agreed that the culture, language and history of Rajasthan and Duggar share some similarities. It was also suggested that the words 'Duggar' and 'Dogra' are common in some parts of Rajasthan. Specifically, it was asserted that areas with many forts are called Duggar, and their inhabitants are accordingly known as Dogras. The land of Duggar also has many forts, which may support the opinion above. An article by Dharam Chand Prashant in the literary magazine Shiraza Dogri suggested that ''\"the opinion that the word 'Duggar' is a form of the word 'Duggarh' sounds appropriate.\"''<ref name=\"book0b3\">\n{{Cite journal\n  | last = Prashant\n  | first = Dharam Chand\n  | title = Duggar Shabad di Vayakha\n  | journal = Shiraza Dogri\n  | date = April\u2013May 1991\n  }}</ref>\n\nThe Turkish ''D\u00f6\u011fer'' is also the name of a Turkmen O\u011fuz tribe originating in Central Asia and also found amongst the Kurds.

The word Durger means 'invincible' in several Northern Indian languages, and could be an allusion to the ruggedness of the Duggar terrain and the historically militarized and autonomous Dogra societies. In Himachal, Dogri is majorly spoken in Hamirpur, Barsar, Una, Chintpurni, Kangra, and Bilaspur regions.\n\nIn 1976, the experts attending the Language Session of the 'All India Oriental Conference' held in Dharwad, [[Karnataka]], could not reach consensus on the 'Dwigart' and 'Durger' hypotheses, but did manage agreement on a Doonger-Duggar connection. In a subsequent 'All India Oriental Conference' held at [[Jaipur]] in 1982, the linguists agreed that the culture, language and history of Rajasthan and Duggar share some similarities. It was also suggested that the words 'Duggar' and 'Dogra' are common in some parts of Rajasthan. Specifically, it was asserted that areas with many forts are called Duggar, and their inhabitants are accordingly known as Dogras. The land of Duggar also has many forts, which may support the opinion above. An article by Dharam Chand Prashant in the literary magazine Shiraza Dogri suggested that ''\"the opinion that the word 'Duggar' is a form of the word 'Duggarh' sounds appropriate.\"''<ref name=\"book0b3\">\n{{Cite journal\n  | last = Prashant\n  | first = Dharam Chand\n  | title = Duggar Shabad di Vayakha\n  | journal = Shiraza Dogri\n  | date = April\u2013May 1991\n  }}</ref>\n\nThe Turkish ''D\u00f6\u011fer'' is also the name of a Turkmen O\u011fuz tribe originating in Central Asia and also found amongst the Kurds.

Popular recent songs include ''Pala Shpaiya Dogarya'', ''Manney di Mauj'' and ''Shhori Deya''. The noted Pakistani singer [[Malika Pukhraj]] had roots in the Duggar region,<ref name=\"book0c03\">\n{{Cite book\n|title=Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures\n|first1=Suad\n|last1=Joseph\n|first2=Afsaneh\n|last2=Najmabadi\n|publisher=Brill\n|location= Leiden\n|year=2003\n|isbn=978-90-04-12821-7\n|pages=75\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VluzAAAAIAAJ\n}}</ref> and her renditions of several Dogri songs continue to be popular in the region. Some devotional songs, or [[bhajan]]s, composed by [[Karan Singh]] have gained increasing popularity over time, including ''Kaun Kareyaan Teri Aarti''.\n\nDogri programming features regularly on [[Radio Kashmir]] (a division of [[All India Radio]]), and [[Doordarshan]] (Indian state television) broadcasts in Jammu and Kashmir. However, Dogri does not have a dedicated state television channel yet, unlike Kashmiri (which has the Doordarshan Koshur channel, available on cable and satellite television throughout India).\n\nOfficial recognition of the language has been gradual, but progressive. On 2 August 1969, the General Council of the [[Sahitya Academy]], Delhi recognized Dogri as an \"independent modern literary language\" of India, based on the unanimous recommendation of a panel of linguists.<ref name=\"book0c1\">\n{{cite book\n|title=Five Decades; the National Academy of Letters, India: a Short History of Sahitya Akademi\n|first=S.\n|last=Rao\n|publisher=Sahitya Akademi\n|location=\n|year=2004\n|isbn=\n|pages=\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=12pjAAAAMAAJ\n}}</ref> (Indian Express, New Delhi, 3 August 1969). Dogri is one of the state languages of the [[India]]n state of Jammu and Kashmir. On 22 December 2003, in a major milestone for the official status of the language, Dogri was recognized as a national language of India in the [[Constitution of India|Indian constitution]].<ref name=\"book0c20\">\n{{Cite news\n |title=Lok Sabha passes bill recognising Dogri, 3 other languages \n |newspaper=Daily Excelsior \n |location=Jammu and Kashmir \n |date=2003-12-23 \n |accessdate=2008-10-31 \n |url=http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/web1/03dec23/news.htm \n |quote=Dogri among other three languages has been included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution when Lok Sabha unanimously approved an amendment in the Constitution \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202165131/http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/web1/03dec23/news.htm \n |archivedate=2008-12-02 \n}}</ref><ref name=\"book0c2\">\n{{cite book\n|title=Language Policy, Culture, and Identity in Asian Contexts\n|first=Amy\n|last=Tsui\n|publisher=Routledge\n|location=\n|year=2007\n|isbn=978-0-8058-5694-1\n|pages=\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xuci1lT08fsC\n}}</ref> In Pakistan, the language (under the name \"Pahari\") continues to thrive, but is not known to have received official patronage to date.
