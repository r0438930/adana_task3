In 1430, an ancestor, also called Sir Robert Logan (d. 1439), and his wife Dame Katherine founded the monastery of St Anthony which was near [[South Leith Parish Church]] with an outlying chapel at [[Arthur's Seat]] in [[Holyrood Park]], which survives as a ruin.<ref>Roger, Charles, ''Historical Notices of St Anthony's Monastery, Leith and Reheasal of Events'' (Grampian Club, 1877), pp. 7, 28.</ref>\n\nRobert inherited [[Fast Castle]] and other lands near the border with England, as 'nephew' and heir of Elizabeth Martene, Lady Fastcastle, widow of Cuthbert Home who had fallen at [[Flodden Field]]. In the 1570s Robert was lord of half of the lands of Fastcastle, and Sir George Ogilvie of Dunlugus was lord of the other half.\n\nIn 1597 he surrendered a number of lands and rights connected to Fast Castle (but not the Castle itself), which he had inherited from George Ogilvy of Dunlugus, to the Hume of [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]] family. The rights included the keeping of [[Berwick Castle]], which had not been in [[capture of Berwick (1482)|Scottish hands since 1482]].<ref>''HMC Milne Home of Wedderburn'' (London, 1902), p. 64.</ref> Fast Castle had been a possession of Coldingham Priory, but after 1598 the lands of the Priory were annexed to the crown, and so Logan now held Fastcastle and Flemington directly from the crown. On 5 April 1603, [[James VI of Scotland]] raised the status of the Restalrig estate into a free barony, which gave Robert extra jurisdictions over his tenants.<ref>''HMC 5th report: Miss M. E.

On 29 July 1586, he wrote from Restalrig to [[Archibald Douglas, Parson of Douglas|Archibald Douglas]] in London, offering his service to [[Francis Walsingham]]. Logan conveyed letters secretly from England for the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Gray]].<ref>''HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield'', vol. 3 (London, 1889), nos. 312, 489.</ref>\n\nJames VI had hoped that Archibald Douglas, a Scotsman resident in London, but not an accredited ambassador, might be able to intervene and save his mother from execution after the revelation of the [[Babington plot]] in 1586. The Master of Gray and Logan corresponded with Douglas on this unofficial diplomacy. The Master of Gray's letters show that he was reluctant to become involved in a project with such doubtful outcomes, but he sent Logan to Douglas in December 1586. After he returned to Fast Castle, Logan wrote back to Douglas on 25 February 1587. By now Mary had been executed and James VI was angry with Gray's actions, and Logan told Douglas not to write to Gray anymore:<blockquote>\"he wryt to me, desirenge me to wryt to your Lordship that ye shuld wryt no moir to hem, for your letters doithe hem very muche harme, and he was no thenge the wisar of your intelligens.
