The '''virtual dedicated server''' ('''VDS''') also has a similar meaning.\n\nA VPS runs its own copy of an operating system (OS), and customers may have [[superuser]]-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. For many purposes they are functionally equivalent to a [[Dedicated hosting service|dedicated physical server]], and being software-defined, are able to be much more easily created and configured. They are priced much lower than an equivalent physical server. However, as they share the underlying physical hardware with other VPSes, performance may be lower, depending on the workload of any other executing virtual machines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-private-server |title=Virtual Private Server (VPS) or Virtual Dedicated Server (VDS)|work=searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com |date=March 2017 |accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Virtualization ==\nThe force driving server virtualization is similar to that which led to the development of [[time-sharing]] and [[multiprogramming]] in the past. Although the resources are still shared, as under the time-sharing model, virtualization provides a higher level of security, dependent on the type of virtualization used, as the individual virtual servers are mostly isolated from each other and may run their own full-fledged [[operating system]] which can be independently rebooted as a virtual instance.\n\nPartitioning a single server to appear as multiple servers has been increasingly common on [[microcomputer]]s since the launch of [[VMware ESX Server]] in 2001. The physical server typically runs a [[hypervisor]] which is tasked with creating, releasing, and managing the resources of \"guest\" operating systems, or [[virtual machine]]s. These guest operating systems are allocated a share of resources of the physical server, typically in a manner in which the guest is not aware of any other physical resources save for those allocated to it by the hypervisor. As a VPS runs its own copy of its operating system, customers have [[superuser]]-level access to that operating system instance, and can install almost any software that runs on the OS; however, due to the number of virtualization clients typically running on a single machine, a VPS generally has limited processor time, [[random access memory|RAM]], and disk space.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.online-sciences.com/computer/vps-web-hosting-virtual-private-server-advantages-and-disadvantages/ |title=VPS Web Hosting ( Virtual Private Server ) advantages and disadvantages|work=online-sciences.com |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Motivation ==\nUltimately, it is used to decrease hardware costs by condensing a failover cluster to a single machine. Thus decreasing costs dramatically while providing the same services. Server roles and features are generally designed to operate in isolation. For example, Windows Server 2019 requires a certificate authority and a domain controller to exist on independent servers with independent instances of windows server. This is because additional roles and features adds areas of potential failure as well as adding visible security risks (placing a certificate authority on a domain controller poses the potential for root access to the root certificate). This directly motivates demand for virtual private servers in order to retain conflicting server roles and features on a single hosting machine. Also, the advent of virtual machine encrypted networks decreases pass-through risks that might have otherwise discouraged VPS usage as a legitimate hosting server.\n\n== Hosting ==\nMany companies offer virtual private server hosting or virtual dedicated server hosting as an extension for [[web hosting]] services.  There are several challenges to consider when licensing proprietary software in multi-tenant virtual environments.\n\nWith ''unmanaged'' or ''self-managed'' hosting, the customer is left to administer their own server instance.\n\n''Unmetered'' hosting is generally offered with no limit on the amount of data-transferred on a fixed bandwidth line. Usually, [https://freewindowsvpslifetime.com/ free windows vps lifetime] unmetered hosting is offered with 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s or 1000 Mbit/s (with some as high as 10Gbit/s). This means that the customer is theoretically able to use ~3 TB on 10 Mbit/s or up to ~300 TB on a 1000 Mbit/s line per month, although in practice the values will be significantly less. In a virtual private server, this will be shared bandwidth and a fair usage policy should be involved.
