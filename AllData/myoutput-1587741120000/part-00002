The opening in the [[wall]] can be referred to as a \"portal\". A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide [[security]] by controlling access to the portal (doorway). [[Convention (norm)|Conventionally]], it is a panel that fits into the portal of a [[building]], [[room]], or [[vehicle]]. Doors are generally made of a material suited to the task of which it is to perform. Doors are commonly attached by hinges within the portal but can be moved by other means such as slides or counterbalancing.\n\nThe door may be moved in various ways (at angles away from the portal, by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) to allow or prevent ingress or egress. In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side. But in other cases (e.g., a [[car door|vehicle door]]) the two sides are radically different.\n\n[[File:Clevelandart 1964.91.jpg|thumb|False door of [[Nykara]], c. 2408 BC, painted limestone, 168 x 111.5 x 6 cm, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]\n\nDoors often incorporate [[lock (security device)|locking]] mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them. Doors can have devices such as knockers or [[doorbell]]s by which people outside can announce their presence and summon someone either to open the door for them or give permission to open and enter. Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors can have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing [[light]] to pass into and out of a space, of controlling [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] or [[air draft]]s so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening [[noise]], and of blocking the spread of [[fire]].\n\nDoors may have [[aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[symbol]]ic, [[ritual]]istic purposes. To be given the [[key (lock)|key]] to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider.<ref>See, for example the doorkeeping duties of the [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]].</ref> Doors and doorways frequently appear in [[literature]] and [[the arts]] with [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegory|allegorical]] import as a portent of change.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section contains verbatim text from the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' (1911) article on doors. See References.-->\n\nThe earliest in records are those represented in the paintings of some [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs, in which they are shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there was no fear of their warping, but in other countries it was necessary to frame them, which according to [[Vitruvius]] (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails ''(see: [[Frame and panel]])'': the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, [[Mortise and tenon|tenoned]] or [[hinge]]d, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the top rail, bottom rail, and middle or intermediate rails.\n\nThe most ancient doors were made of timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's temple]] being in [[olive wood]] (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in [[Homer]] appear to have been cased in silver or brass. Besides olive wood, [[elm (wood)|elm]], [[cedar (wood)|cedar]], [[oak (wood)|oak]] and [[cypress (wood)|cypress]] were used. A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in [[Switzerland]].<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ Swiss archaeologists find 5000-year-old door] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108222716/http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 550\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = stone door.jpg\n| width1 =\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Stone door in [[Hampi]] ([[India]])\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Door-Post Socket (4690606141).jpg\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = A massive door socket from [[Persepolis]] (modern-day [[Iran]])\n}}\n\nAll ancient doors were hung by pivots at the top and bottom of the hanging stile which worked in sockets in the [[lintel]] and [[sill plate|sill]], the latter being always in some hard stone such as [[basalt]] or [[granite]]. Those found at [[Nippur]] by Dr. Hilprecht dating from 2000 BC were in [[dolerite]]. The tenons of the [[gate]]s at [[Balawat]] were sheathed with bronze (now in the [[British Museum]]). These doors or gates were hung in two leaves, each about {{convert|2.54|m|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; they were encased with bronze bands or strips, {{convert|25.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, covered with [[repouss\u00e9]] decoration of figures. The wood doors would seem to have been about {{convert|7.62|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, but the hanging stile was over {{convert|360|mm|in}} diameter. Other sheathings of various sizes in bronze have been found, which proves this to have been the universal method adopted to protect the wood pivots. In the [[Hauran]] in Syria, where timber is scarce the doors were made in stone, and one measuring {{convert|1.63|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|0.79|m|in|abbr=on}} is in the British Museum; the band on the meeting stile shows that it was one of the leaves of a double door. At Kuffeir near Bostra in Syria, Burckhardt found stone doors, {{convert|2.74|to|3.048|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, being the entrance doors of the town. In [[Etruria]] many stone doors are referred to by Dennis.\n\n[[File:Plaster cast of folding doors, Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] folding doors at [[Pompeii]], from the 1st century AD, similar with Neoclassical doors from the 19th century]]\n\nAncient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] doors were either single doors, double doors, triple doors, [[sliding door]]s or [[folding door]]s, in the last case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In [[Eumachia]], is a painting of a door with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at [[Agrigentum]] there is a single four-panel door carved in stone. In the Blundell collection is a [[bas-relief]] of a temple with double doors, each leaf with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the [[Santi Cosma e Damiano|church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano]], in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle. Two other bronze doors of the Roman period are in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Lateran Basilica]].\n\nThe Greek scholar [[Heron of Alexandria]] created the earliest known automatic door in the 1st century AD during the era of [[Roman Egypt]].<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 162\">Needham, Joseph.

The doors of the [[church of the Nativity]] at [[Bethlehem]] (6th century) are covered with plates of bronze, cut out in patterns. Those of [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]], of the 8th and 9th century, are wrought in bronze, and the west doors of the cathedral of [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] (9th century), of similar manufacture, were probably brought from Constantinople, as also some of those in [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Marks, Venice]]. The bronze doors on the Aachen Cathedral in Germany date back to about 800 AD. Bronze baptistery doors at the Cathedral of Florence were completed in 1423 by Ghiberti.<ref>Architecture, European Copper Institute; {{cite web |url=http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009005711/http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |archivedate=2012-10-09 }}</ref> ''(For more information, see: [[Copper in architecture]]).''\n\n[[File:T\u00fcr, Villa Boscoreale.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] wall painting of an ornate door, in the [[Villa Boscoreale]] ([[Italy]]), from the 1st century AD]]\n\nOf the 11th and 12th centuries there are numerous examples of bronze doors, the earliest being one at [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]] (1015). The Hildesheim design affected the concept of [[Gniezno Doors|Gniezno door]] in Poland. Of others in South Italy and Sicily, the following are the finest: in Sant Andrea, [[Amalfi]] (1060); [[Salerno]] (1099); [[Canosa]] (1111); [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], two doors (1119 and 1124); [[Ravello]] (1179), by Barisano of Trani, who also made doors for [[Trani]] cathedral; and in [[Monreale]] and [[Duomo di Pisa|Pisa]] cathedrals, by Bonano of Pisa. In all these cases the hanging stile had pivots at the top and bottom. The exact period when the hinge was substituted is not quite known, but the change apparently brought about another method of strengthening and decorating doors, viz, with wrought-iron bands of infinite varieties of design. As a rule three bands from which the ornamental work springs constitute the hinges, which have rings outside the hanging stiles fitting on to vertical tenons run into the masonry or wooden frame. There is an early example of the 12th century in [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]]; in France the metal work of the doors of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] at Paris is perhaps the most beautiful in execution, but examples are endless throughout France and England.\n\nReturning to Italy, the most celebrated doors are those of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)]], which together with the door frames are all in bronze, the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable: the modeling of the figures, birds and foliage of the south doorway, by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330), and of the east doorway by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] (1425\u20131452), are of great beauty; in the north door (1402\u20131424) Ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as Andrea Pisano, but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled, with bas-reliefs, in which Scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures, these being probably the gates of Paradise of which [[Michelangelo]] speaks.\n\nThe doors of the mosques in [[Cairo]] were of two kinds; those which, externally, were cased with sheets of bronze or iron, cut out in decorative patterns, and incised or inlaid, with bosses in relief; and those in wood, which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond, this latter description of work being [[Copt]]ic in its origin. The doors of the palace at [[Palermo]], which were made by Saracenic workmen for the [[Normans]], are fine examples and in good preservation. A somewhat similar decorative class of door to these latter is found in [[Verona]], where the edges of the stiles and rails are beveled and notched.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433.JPG|thumb|Glass door decorated with [[Art Nouveau]] elements, from the [[Singer House]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nIn the Renaissance period the Italian doors are quite simple, their architects trusting more to the doorways for effect; but in France and Germany the contrary is the case, the doors being elaborately carved, especially in the [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] periods, and sometimes with architectural features such as columns and entablatures with pediment and niches, the doorway being in plain masonry. While in Italy the tendency was to give scale by increasing the number of panels, in France the contrary seems to have been the rule; and one of the great doors at [[Fontainebleau]], which is in two leaves, is entirely carried out as if consisting of one great panel only.\n\nThe earliest [[Renaissance]] doors in France are those of the [[Aix Cathedral|cathedral of St. Sauveur]] at [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] (1503). In the lower panels there are figures {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[niche (architecture)|niches]], and in the upper panels a double range of niches with figures about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high with canopies over them, all carved in [[cedrus|cedar]]. The south door of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] is in some respects the finest in France; the upper panels are carved in high relief with figure subjects and canopies over them. The doors of the church at [[Gisors]] (1575) are carved with figures in niches subdivided by classic pilasters superimposed. In St. Maclou at [[Rouen]] are three magnificently carved doors; those by Jean Goujon have figures in niches on each side, and others in a group of great beauty in the center. The other doors, probably about forty to fifty years later, are enriched with [[bas-reliefs]], landscapes, figures and elaborate interlaced borders.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at the Kennedy Space Center contains the four largest doors. The Vehicle Assembly Building was originally built for the assembly of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions' [[Saturn V|Saturn]] vehicles and was then used to support Space Shuttle operations.

The most common type is the '''single-leaf door''', which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway. There are many variations on this basic design, such as the '''double-leaf door''' or '''double door and French windows''', which have two adjacent independent panels hinged on each side of the doorway.\n* A '''half door''' or '''[[Dutch door]]'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103193405/http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas/ |archivedate=2018-01-03 }} Door design ideas</ref> or '''stable door''' is divided in half horizontally. Traditionally the top half can be opened to allow a [[horse]] or other animal to be fed, while the bottom half remains closed to keep the animal inside. This style of door has been adapted for homes.\n* '''[[Western saloon|Saloon]] doors''' are a pair of lightweight swing doors often found in public bars, and especially associated with the American west. Saloon doors, also known as '''[[wikt:cafe|cafe]] doors''', often use bidirectional [[hinge]]s that close the door regardless of which direction it is opened by incorporating [[spring (device)|springs]]. Saloon doors that only extend from knee-level to chest-level are known as '''batwing doors'''.\n* A '''blind door''', '''Gibb door''', or '''jib door''' has no visible trim or operable components. It is designed to blend with the adjacent wall in all finishes, and visually to be a part of the wall, a disguised door.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Peter |title=The New and Improved Practical Builder |location=London |publisher=Thomas Kelly|date=1841 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n* A '''French door''' consists of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a '''French window''', as it resembles a door-height [[casement window]]. When a pair of French doors is used as a French window, the application does not generally include a central [[mullion]] (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An [[espagnolette]] bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.\n* A '''[[louvred door]]''' has fixed or movable wooden fins (often called slats or [[louver]]s) which permit open ventilation while preserving privacy and preventing the passage of light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for [[wardrobe]]s and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form [[window shutter]]s. Double louvred doors were introduced into ''[[Powel Crosley, Jr.#Seagate in Florida|Seagate]]'', built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy in that it is impossible to see through the fins in any direction.\n* A '''composite door''' is a single leaf door that can be solid or with glass, and is usually filled with high density foam. In the United Kingdom, it is common for composite doors to be certified to BS PAS 23/24<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean/|title=What does 'certificated' to PAS 24 actually mean?|work=thecrimepreventionwebsite.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125223650/http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean|archivedate=2014-01-25}}</ref> and be compliant with Secured by Design, an official UK police initiative.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doors and Locks |url=https://www.securedbydesign.com/guidance/standards-explained#doors-and-locks |website=Secured by Design |publisher=Police Crime Prevention Initiative |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n* A '''steel security door''' is one which is made from strong steel, often for use on [[Bank vault|vaults]] and [[safe room]]s to withstand attack. These may also be fitted with wooden outer panels to resemble standard internal and external doors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|title=Henleys Security Doors|website=Henleys Security Doors|access-date=25 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530035319/http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|archivedate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n* A '''flush door''' is a completely smooth door, having [[plywood]] or [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] fixed over a light timber frame, the hollow parts of which are often filled with a cardboard core material. Skins can also be made out of hardboards, the first of which was invented by William H Mason in 1924. Called [[Masonite]], its construction involved pressing and steaming wood chips into boards. Flush doors are most commonly employed in the interior of a dwelling, although slightly more substantial versions are occasionally used as exterior doors, especially within hotels and other buildings containing many independent dwellings.\n* A '''moulded door''' has the same structure as that of flush door. The only difference is that the surface material is a moulded skin made of MDF. Skins can also be made out of [[Masonite|hardboards]].\n* A '''ledge and brace door''' often called board and batten doors are made from multiple vertical boards fixed together by two or more horizontal timbers called ledges (or battens)and sometimes kept square by additional diagonal timbers called braces.\n* A '''[[wicket gate|wicket door]]''' is a pedestrian door built into a much larger door allowing access without requiring the opening of the larger door. Examples might be found on the ceremonial door of a cathedral or in a large vehicle door in a garage or hangar.\n* A '''bifold door'''<span id=\"bifold\"></span><!-- The preceding tag is a target for links on other pages, probably including the Dab [[Folding]]. --> is a unit that has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood is the most common material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most commonly made for [[closet]]s, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|title=Front Doors, Garage Doors Insights from The Door Zone|website=The Door Zone|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507074631/http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|archivedate=2017-05-07}}</ref>\n* A '''[[sliding glass door]]''', sometimes called an Arcadia door or patio door, is a door made of [[glass]] that slides open and sometimes has a screen (a removable metal mesh that covers the door).\n* '''Australian doors''' are a pair of plywood swinging doors often found in Australian public houses. These doors are generally red or brown in color and bear a resemblance to the more formal doors found in other British Colonies' public houses.\n* A '''false door''' is a wall decoration that looks like a window. In ancient [[Egyptian architecture]], this was a common element in a tomb, the false door representing a gate to the afterlife. They can also be found in the funerary architecture of the desert tribes (e.g., [[Libya]]n Ghirza).\n* A '''[[Mat|doormat]]''' (also called door mat) is a mat placed typically in front of or behind a door of a home.

The axis of rotation is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged [[garage door]]s, the axis may be horizontal, above the door opening.\n\nDoors can be hinged so that the axis of rotation is not in the plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the door opens. This requires a mechanism so that the axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the door opens. This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as for the door to the toilet, which opens inward.\n\nA '''swing door''' has special single-action hinges that allow it to open either outwards or inwards, and is usually sprung to keep it closed.\n\n'''French doors''' are derived from an original French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels would be in a casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel at the bottom of the door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.\n\nA '''Mead door''', developed by S Mead of Leicester, swings both ways. It is susceptible to forced entry due to its design.\n\nA '''Dutch door''' or stable door consists of two halves. The top half operates independently from the bottom half. A variant exists in which opening the top part separately is possible, but because the lower part has a lip on the inside, closing the top part, while leaving the lower part open, is not.\n\nA '''garden door''' resembles a French window (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the operating door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch is located at the wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an [[espagnolette]] bolt.\n\n=== Sliding doors ===\nIt is often useful to have doors which slide along tracks, often for space or aesthetic considerations.\n\nA '''bypass door''' is a door unit that has two or more sections. The doors can slide in either direction along one axis on parallel overhead tracks, sliding past each other. They are most commonly used in closets, in order to access one side of the closet at a time. The doors in a bypass unit will overlap slightly when viewed from the front, in order not to have a visible gap between them.\n\nDoors which slide inside a wall cavity are called '''[[pocket door]]s'''. This type of door is used in tight spaces where privacy is also required. The door slab is mounted to roller and a track at the top of the door and slides inside a wall.\n\nSliding glass doors are common in many houses, particularly as an entrance to the backyard. Such doors are also popular for use for the entrances to commercial structures, although they are not counted as fire exit doors. The door that moves is called the \"active leaf\", while the door that remains fixed is called the \"inactive leaf\".\n\n=== Rotating doors ===\nA '''[[revolving door]]''' has several wings or leaves, generally four, radiating from a central shaft, forming compartments that rotate about a vertical axis. A revolving door allows people to pass in both directions without colliding, and forms an airlock maintaining a seal between inside and out.\n\nA '''pivot door''', instead of hinges, is supported on a bearing some distance away from the edge, so that there is more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the opening side. In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.\n\n=== High-speed door ===\nA '''[[high-speed door]]''' is a very fast door some with opening speeds of up to 4&nbsp;m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where the speed of a door has an effect on production logistics, temperature and pressure control. high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded.\n\nHigh-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200,000 a year. They need to be built with heavy-duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections. High Speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the [[Green energy|Green]] and [[Energy saving]] requirements.\n\nIn North America, the Door and Access Systems Manufacturing Association (DASMA) defines high-performance doors as non-residential, powered doors, characterized by rolling, folding, sliding or swinging action, that are either high-cycle (minimum 100 cycles/day) or high-speed (minimum 20 inches(508&nbsp;mm)/second), and two out of three of the following: made-to-order for exact size and custom features, designed to be able to withstand equipment impact (break-away if accidentally hit by vehicle) or designed to sustain heavy usage with minimal maintenance.\n\n=== Automatic ===\n'''[[Automatic door|Automatically opening doors]]''' are powered open and closed either by electricity, spring, or both. There are several methods by which an automatically opening door is activated:\n\n# A [[sensor]] detects traffic is approaching. Sensors for automatic doors are generally:\n#* A [[pressure sensor]] \u2013 e.g., a floor mat which reacts to the pressure of someone standing on it.\n#* An [[infrared]] [[curtain]] or beam which shines invisible light onto sensors; if someone or something blocks the beam the door is triggered open.\n#* A [[motion sensor]] which uses low-power microwave [[radar]] for the same effect.\n#* A remote sensor (e.g. based on infrared or radio waves) can be triggered by a portable [[remote control]], or is installed inside a vehicle. These are popular for garage doors.\n# A [[switch]] is operated manually, perhaps after security checks. This can be a push button switch or a swipe card.\n# The act of pushing or pulling the door triggers the open and close cycle. These are also known as power-assisted doors.\n\nIn addition to activation sensors automatically opening doors are generally fitted with safety sensors. These are usually an infrared curtain or beam, but can be a pressure mat fitted on the swing side of the door. The purpose of the safety sensor is to prevent the door from colliding with an object in its path by stopping or slowing its motion.A mechanism is set in modern automatic doors to ensure that door will be in open state in case of power failure.\n\n=== Others ===\n[[Image:Puertas seccionales.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Sectional doors for industry.]]\n[[File:Torggler evolutiondoor.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|''Evolution Door'', 2013]]\n'''Up-and-over''' or '''overhead''' doors are often used in garages. Instead of hinges it has a mechanism, often [[counterbalance]]d or [[torsion spring|sprung]], that allows it to be lifted so that it rests horizontally above the opening. A [[roller shutter]] or '''sectional overhead door''' is one variant of this type.\n\nA '''[[tambour door]]''' or roller door is an up-and-over door made of narrow horizontal slats and \"rolls\" up and down by sliding along vertical tracks and is typically found in entertainment centres and cabinets.\n\n'''Inward opening doors''' are doors that can only be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a substantial fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards in the event of an emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.\n\n'''Rebated doors''', a term chiefly used in Britain, are double doors having a lip or overlap (i.e. a [[Rabbet]]) on the vertical edge(s) where they meet. Fire-rating can be achieved with an applied edge-guard or astragal molding on the meeting stile, in accordance with the American [[Fire door]].\n\n'''Evolution Door''' is a trackless door that moves in the same closure level as a sliding door. The system is an invention of the Austrian artist Klemens Torggler. It is a further development of the '''{{ill|Drehplattent\u00fcr|de|Drehplattent\u00fcr|vertical-align=sup}}''' that normally consists of two rotatable, connected panels which move to each other when opening.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|title=Kinematics with MicroStation Ch01C-I Grueblers Criteria for 3D 5 Bar|date=20 February 2014|work=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409090618/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|archivedate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Miersch, 17 rue Nicolas Welter-001.jpg|thumb|250px|Transparent awning in [[Luxembourg]]]]\nArchitectural doors have numerous general and specialized uses. Doors are generally used to separate interior spaces (closets, rooms, etc.) for [[convenience]], [[privacy]], [[safety]], and [[security]] reasons. Doors are also used to secure passages into a building from the exterior, for reasons of [[climate]] control and safety.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nDoors also are applied in more specialized cases:\n* A '''[[blast door|Blast-proof door]]''' is constructed to allow access to a structure as well as to provide protection from the force of explosions.\n* A '''garden door''' is any door that opens to a backyard or [[garden]]. This term is often used specifically for French windows, double French doors (with lites instead of panels), in place of a [[sliding glass door]]. The term also may refer to what is known as ''patio doors''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A jib door is a concealed door, whose surface reflects the moldings and finishes of the wall. These were used in historic English houses, mainly as servants' doors.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A '''[[pet door]]''' (also known as a [[cat flap]] or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a [[rubber]] flap, or it may be an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only allowing pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.\n* A '''[[trapdoor]]''' is a door that is oriented horizontally in a [[ceiling]] or [[floor]], often accessed via a [[ladder]].\n* A '''water door''' or '''water entrance''', such as those used in [[Venice, Italy]], is a door leading from a building built on the water, such as a canal, to the water itself where, for example, one may enter or exit a private boat or [[water taxi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|website=See Venice, Italy|title=Doors in Venice: among water, art and architecture|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103074300/http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|archivedate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>Water doors make frequent appearances in [[Donna Leon]]'s books, and in some are important plot devices, as in [[Donna Leon#Commissario Guido Brunetti novels|''Acqua Alta'' aka ''Death in High Water'' (1996) and ''Beastly Things'' (2012)]].</ref>\n\n== Construction and components ==\n[[File:Door-glossary.png|thumb|Parts of a panel or glazed door]]\n[[File:Door-midrail-detail.png|thumb|Joint between midrail, lockrail and a gunstock stile]]\n[[File:Frame-filled-door.gif|thumb|A frame and filled door]]\n[[File:hollow door.jpg|thumb|A hollow door with one face removed]]\n\n=== Panel doors ===\nPanel doors, also called stile and rail doors, are built with [[frame and panel]] construction. EN 12519 is describing the terms which are officially used in European Member States. The main parts are listed below:\n* [[Stile]]s \u2013 Vertical boards that run the full height of a door and compose its right and left edges. The hinges are mounted to the fixed side (known as the \"hanging stile\"), and the handle, lock, bolt or latch are mounted on the swinging side (known as the \"latch stile\").\n* [[Frame and panel|Rails]] \u2013 Horizontal boards at the top, bottom, and optionally in the middle of a door that join the two stiles and split the door into two or more rows of panels. The \"top rail\" and \"bottom rail\" are named for their positions. The bottom rail is also known as \"kick rail\". A middle rail at the height of the bolt is known as the \"lock rail\", other middle rails are commonly known as \"cross rails\".\n* [[Mullion]]s \u2013 Smaller optional vertical boards that run between two rails, and split the door into two or more columns of panels, the term is used sometimes for verticals in doors, but more often (UK and Australia) it refers to verticals in windows.\n* Muntin \u2013 Optional vertical members that divide the door into smaller panels.\n* Panels \u2013 Large, wider boards used to fill the space between the stiles, rails, and mullions. The panels typically fit into grooves in the other pieces, and help to keep the door rigid. Panels may be flat, or in raised panel designs. Can be glued in or stay as a floating panel.\n* Light \u2013 a piece of glass used in place of a panel, essentially giving the door a window.\n\n=== Board batten doors ===\nAlso known as ledges and braced,\nBoard and batten doors are an older design consisting primarily of vertical slats:\n* Planks \u2013 Boards wider than 9\" that extend the full height of the door, and are placed side by side filling the door's width.\n* Ledges and braces \u2013 Ledges extend horizontally across the door which the boards are affixed to. The ledges hold the planks together. When diagonally they are called braces which prevent the door from skewing. On some doors, especially antique ones, the ledges are replaced with iron bars that are often built into the hinges as extensions of the door-side plates.\n\n=== Ledged and braced doors ===\nAs board and Batten doors\n\n=== Impact-resistant doors ===\nImpact-resistant doors have rounded stile edges to dissipate energy and minimize edge chipping, scratching and denting. The formed edges are often made of an engineered material. Impact-resistant doors excel in high traffic areas such as hospitals, schools, hotels and coastal areas.\n\n=== Frame and filled doors ===\nThis type consists of a solid timber frame, filled on one face, face with Tongue and Grooved boards. Quite often used externally with the boards on the weather face.\n\n=== Flush doors ===\nMany modern doors, including most interior doors, are flush doors:\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* Core material: Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce drumminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core flush doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board and batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are then covered with [[wood veneer]], thin [[plywood]], [[sheet metal]], [[fiberglass]], or [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]]. The wooden materials are usually layered with the grain alternating direction between layers to prevent warping. Fiberglass and metal-faced doors are sometimes given a layer of cellulose so that they may be stained to look like wood.\n\n=== Moulded doors ===\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* '''Core material''': Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce druminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], extruded polystyrene foam, or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core molded doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board & batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are covered with HDF / [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] skins.\n\n=== Swing direction ===\n'''Door swings'''\n[[File:Art Nouveau entrance in Pia\u021ba Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu (Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Square), from Bucharest (Romania).jpg|thumb|225px|[[Art Nouveau]] door in [[Bucharest]] (Romania), with a [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]] above it]]\nFor most of the world {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}, door swings, or handing, are determined while standing on the outside or less secure side of the door while facing the door (i.e., standing on the side requiring a key to open, going from outside to inside, or from public to private).\n\nIt is especially important to get the hand and swing correct on exterior doors, as the transom is usually sloped and sealed to resist water entry, and to properly drain. In some custom [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] (or with some master carpenters), the manufacture or installer will bevel the leading edge (the first edge to meet the jamb as the door is closing) so that the door fits tight without binding. Specifying an incorrect hand or swing will cause the door to bind, not close properly or leak (for exterior doors). Fixing this specification error will be expensive or time-consuming. In North America, many doors now come with factory-installed hinges, pre-hung on the jamb and sills.\n\nWhile facing the door from the outside or less secure side, if the hinge is on the right side of the door, the door is \"right handed\"; or if the hinge is on the left, it is \"left handed\". If the door swings toward you, it is \"reverse swing\"; or if the door swings away from you, it is \"Normal swing\".\n\nIn other words,\n*In the United States:\n** '''Left hand hinge (LHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side, or on the public side of the door), the hinges are on the left and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Right hand hinge (RHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Left hand reverse (LHR):''' Standing outside the house (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the left, knob on right, on opening the door it swings towards you (i.e. the door swings open towards the outside, or \"outswing\")\n** '''Right hand reverse (RHR):''' Standing outside the house (i.e. on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right, knob on left, opening the door by pulling the door towards you (i.e. open swings to the outside, or \"outswing\")\n*In Europe:\nOne of the oldest [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]] standard applies: DIN 107 \"Building construction; identification of right and left side\" (first 1922\u201305, current 1974-04) defines that '''doors are categorized from the side where the door hinges can be seen'''. If the hinges are on the left, it is a DIN Left door (DIN links, DIN gauche), if the hinges are on the right, it is a DIN Right door (DIN rechts, DIN droite). The DIN Right and DIN Left marking are also used to categorize matching installation material such as [[mortise lock]]s (referenced in DIN 107). The European Standard DIN EN 12519 \"Windows and pedestrian doors. Terminology\" includes these definitions of orientation.\n*In Australia:\nThe \"refrigerator rule\" applies, and a refrigerator door is not opened from the inside. If the hinges are on the right then it is a right hand (or right hung) door. (Australian Standards for Installation of Timber Doorsets, AS 1909\u20131984 pg 6.)\n\nIn public buildings, exterior doors should open to the outside in order to comply with any fire codes that may be in force in that jurisdiction. If the door opens inward and there is a fire, there can be a crush of people who run for the door and they will not be able to open it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|title=Why do the entry doors to most homes open inward, while in most public buildings, the entry doors open outward?|date=2001-03-02|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920044229/http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|archivedate=2017-09-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Types ===\nNew exterior doors are largely defined by the type of materials they are made from: [[wood]], [[steel]], [[fiberglass]], [[UPVC]]/vinyl, [[aluminum]], composite, [[Glass|glass (patio doors)]]...\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 350\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 =Strasbourg 1 rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Castelnau (2).jpg \n| width1 = 140\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Wooden door of a building from [[Strasbourg]] (France), decorated with [[pediment]]s on it\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Pierre Rousseau - Double-Leaf Doors - 1942.2.12.a - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] double-leaf doors by [[Pierre Rousseau]], 1790s\n}}\n[[File:Glass and metal door on Calea Victoriei (Victory's Avenue) in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|200px|right|thumb|Glass and metal door, decoarted with Neoclassical ornaments, in [[Bucharest]] (Romania)]]\n'''Wooden doors''' \u2013 including solid wood doors \u2013 are a top choice for many homeowners, largely because of the aesthetic qualities of wood. Many wood doors are custom-made, but they have several downsides: their price, their maintenance requirements (regular painting and staining) and their limited insulating value<ref>Exterior Doors; Energy.gov; {{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304181502/http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |archivedate=2015-03-04 }}</ref> (R-5 to R-6, not including the effects of the glass elements of the doors). Wood doors often have an overhang requirement to maintain a warranty. An overhang is a roof, porch area or awning that helps to protect the door and its finish from [[Ultraviolet|UV]] rays.\n\n'''Steel doors''' are another major type of residential front doors; most of them come with a [[polyurethane]] or other type of [[foam]] insulation core \u2013 a critical factor in a building's overall comfort and efficiency. Steel doors mostly in default comes along with frame and lock system, which is a high cost efficiency factor compared to ''Wooden doors''\n\nMost modern exterior walls are designed to provide [[thermal insulation]] and [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]], which can be indicated by the [[Energy Star]] label or the [[Passive House]] standards. Premium '''composite''' (including steel doors with a thick core of polyurethane or other foam), '''fiberglass''' and '''vinyl doors''' benefit from the materials they are made from, from a thermal perspective.\n\n=== Insulation and weatherstrips ===\n{{Context|section|date=November 2015}}\nBut there are very few door models with an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] close to 10 (which is far less than the R-40 walls or the R-50 ceilings of super-insulated buildings \u2013 [[Passive Solar]] and [[Zero-energy building|Zero Energy Buildings]]). Typical doors are not thick enough to provide very high levels of energy efficiency.\n\nMany doors may have good R-values at their center, but their overall energy efficiency is reduced because of the presence of glass and reinforcing elements, or because of poor [[weatherstripping]] and the way the door is manufactured.\n\nDoor weatherstripping is particularly important for energy efficiency. German-made Passive House doors use multiple weatherstrips, including magnetic strips, to meet higher standards. These weatherstrips are critical to reduce to a minimum energy losses due to air leakage.\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n{{Globalize|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== United States ====\nThe standard door sizes in the US run along 2\" increments. Customary sizes have a height of 78\" (1981&nbsp;mm) or 80\" (2032&nbsp;mm) and a width of 18\" (472&nbsp;mm), 24\" (610&nbsp;mm), 26\" (660&nbsp;mm), 28\" (711&nbsp;mm), 30\" (762&nbsp;mm) or 36\" (914&nbsp;mm).<ref>options at homedepot.com</ref> Most residential passage (room to room) doors are 30\" x 80\" (762&nbsp;mm x 2032&nbsp;mm).\n\nA standard US residential (exterior) door size is 36\" x 80\" (91 x 203&nbsp;cm). Interior doors for wheelchair access must also have a minimum width of 3'-0\" (91&nbsp;cm). Residential interior doors are often somewhat smaller being 6'-8\" high, as are many small stores, offices, and other light commercial buildings. Larger commercial, public buildings and grand homes often use doors of greater height. Older buildings often have smaller doors.\n\nThickness: Most pre-fabricated doors are 1 3/8\" thick (for interior doors) or 1 3/4\" (exterior).\n\n'''Closets:''' small spaces such as closets, dressing rooms, half-baths, storage rooms, cellars, etc. often are accessed through doors smaller than passage doors in one or both dimensions but similar in design.\n\n'''Garages:''' Garage doors are generally 7'-0\" or 8'-0\" wide for a single-car opening. Two car garage doors (sometimes called double car doors) are a single door 16'-0\". Because of size and weight these doors are usually sectional. That is split into four or five horizontal sections so that they can be raised more easily and don't require a lot of additional space above the door when opening and closing. There are single piece double garage doors found in some older homes. circa 1950's\n\n==== Europe ====\nThe standard DIN doors are defined in DIN 18101 (published 1955\u201307, 1985\u201301, 2014-08). The door sizes are also given in the construction standard for wooden door panels (DIN 68706-1). The DIN commission was also responsible for the harmonized European standard DIN EN 14351-1 for exterior doors and DIN EN 14351-2 for interior doors (published 2006\u201307, 2010-08), which defines the requirements for the [[CE marking]] giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix.\n\nThe DIN 18101 standard has a normative size (Nennma\u00df) slightly larger than the panel size (T\u00fcrblatt) as the standard derives the panel sizes from the normative size being different single door vs double door and molded vs unmolded doors. The DIN 18101/1985 defines interior single molded doors to have a common panel height of 1985&nbsp;mm (normativ height 2010&nbsp;mm) at panel widths of 610&nbsp;mm, 735&nbsp;mm, 860&nbsp;mm, 985&nbsp;mm, 1110&nbsp;mm, plus a larger door panel size of 1110&nbsp;mm x 2110&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|title=T\u00fcrblattgr\u00f6\u00dfen nach DIN 18101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219203924/http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|archivedate=2015-02-19}}</ref> The newer DIN 18101/2014 drops the definition of just five standard door sizes in favor of a basic raster running along 125&nbsp;mm increments where the height and width are independent.

When a door has more than one movable section, one of the sections may be called a ''leaf''. See [[door furniture]] for a discussion of attachments to doors such as [[door handle]]s, [[doorknob]]s, and [[door knocker]]s.\n* [[Lintel]] \u2013 A horizontal beam above a door that supports the wall above it. (Also known as a ''header'')\n* [[Jamb]]s or legs \u2013 The vertical posts that form the sides of a door frame, where the hinges are mounted, and with which the bolt interacts.\n* Sill (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal [[sill plate]] below the door that supports the door frame.

This includes items such as hinges, handles, door stops, etc.\n\n== Related accidents ==\n'''Door safety''' relates to prevention of door-related [[accident]]s. Such accidents take place in various forms, and in a number of locations; ranging from car doors to garage doors. Accidents vary in severity and frequency. According to the [[National Safety Council]] in the [[United States]], 300,000 injuries are caused by doors every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|title=Protecting Children\u2019s Fingers from Door Injuries|work=The Redwoods Group|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324033919/http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24}}</ref>\n\nThe types of accidents vary from relatively minor cases where doors cause damage to other objects, such as walls, to serious cases resulting in human injury, particularly to fingers, hands, and feet. A closing door can exert up to 40 [[ton]]s per square inch of [[pressure]] between the [[hinge]]s. Because of the number of accidents taking place, there has been a surge in the number of [[lawsuit]]s. Thus organisations may be at risk when car doors or doors within buildings are unprotected.\n\nAccording to the US [[General Services Administration]], discussing child care centres:\n{{quote|...It is essential that children's fingers be protected from being crushed or otherwise injured in the hinge space of a swinging door or gate. There are simple devices available to attach to the hinge side, ensuring that this type of injury does not occur. As the door closes, the hand is pushed out of the opening, away from harm. In addition, young children are vulnerable to injury when they fall against the other (hinged) side of doors and gates, striking projected hinges. Piano hinges are not recommended to alleviate this problem as they tend to sag over time with heavy use. Instead, an inexpensive device fitting over hinges is available on the market and should be used to ensure safety...<ref>USA General Services Administration Child Care Center Design Guide, June 1998</ref>}}\n\n=== Outward and inward opening ===\nWhenever a door is opened outwards there is a risk that it could strike another person. In many cases this can be avoided by [[architectural design]] which favors doors which open inwards into rooms (from the perspective of a common area such as a corridor, the door opens outwards). In cases where this is infeasible, it may be possible to avoid an accident by placing [[vision panel]]s in the door.<ref>Home Safety Guidelines for Architects & Builders, NBS GCR 78-156, BOSTI, December 1978</ref>\n\nHowever, inward-hinged doors can also escalate an accident by preventing people from escaping the building: people inside the building may press against the doors, and thus prevent the doors from opening. Related accidents include:\n* [[Grue Church fire]] - Grue, Norway in 1822\n* [[Victoria Hall Disaster]] - Sunderland, UK in 1883\n* [[Glen Cinema disaster]] - Paisley, UK in 1929\n* [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] - Boston, USA in 1942\n\nToday, the exterior doors of most large (especially public) buildings open outward, while interior doors such as doors to individual rooms, offices, suites, etc. open inward, as do many exterior doors of houses, particularly in North America.\n\n=== Doorstops ===\n[[Doorstop]]s are simple devices used to prevent a door from coming into contact with another object (typically a wall). Without the door stop damage might be done to the wall. They may either absorb the force of a moving door, or hold the door in place to prevent unintended motion.\n\n=== Door guards ===\nThe purpose of door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger trapping devices, or finger guards) is to reduce the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.\n\nThere are various levels of door protection. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear hinge pin side of the door unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.\nWhich level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a [[risk assessment]] of the door.\n\nThere is also handle-side door protection, which prevents the door from slamming shut on the frame, which can cause injury to fingers/hands.\n\n=== Safety doors ===\nA safety door prevents finger injuries near the hinges without the use of door guards. Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular (\"bull-nose\" shaped) extension to the door, which moves in and out of a cavity as the door opens and closes. This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges \u2013 either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a [[doorstop]]).\n\n=== Glass doors ===\n[[Arcadia door|Glass doors]] pose the risk of unintentional collision if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, [[sticker]]s or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface to make it more visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated, tempered or toughened glass.\n\n=== Fire ===\n{{Main|Fire door}}\n\nSpecial purpose fire doors are often employed in buildings to reduce the overall risk of fire, particularly by preventing the spread of fire and smoke. In cases where they are improperly installed, employed, or tampered with, the risk of fire can be increased. [[Door closer]]s are sometimes used to ensure fire doors remain closed.\n\nAn additional risk in a fire is that doors may prevent access to [[emergency service]]s personnel in order to fight the fire, rescue occupants, etc. [[Door breaching]] techniques may be required in these situations to gain access.\n\n[[Panic bar]]s are often used in buildings so that a door locked from the exterior can quickly and easily be opened from the inside in the event of a fire or other emergency.\n\n=== Vehicle doors ===\n{{Main|Vehicle door}}\nThere may be an increased risk of trapping hands or fingers in car doors compared to other types of doors, due to the proximity in which the occupant sits. In some car accidents, injury to occupants from the movement of car doors may occur.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nBicyclists cycling on public roads fear [[dooring]]: collision with an abruptly opened vehicle door. Because cyclists often ride near parked cars along the side of the road they are particularly vulnerable.\n\n=== Aircraft doors ===\nDoors which lead from interior, pressurized, sections of an aircraft to exterior or unpressurized areas can pose extreme risk if they are inadvertently opened during flight. This can be mitigated by having doors that open inwardly and are designed to be forced into their door frames by the internal cabin pressure \u2013 most cabin doors are of this type. However, an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space, and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure.\n\nA number of accidents have occurred where outward-opening aircraft doors were opened in flight, often accidentally:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 96]] (1972)\n* [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] (1974)\n* [[United Airlines Flight 811]] (1989)\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Hinge bender]], a tool for adjusting door hinges\n* [[Biometrics]]\n* [[Closed-circuit television]]\n* [[Coal hole]]\n* [[Door security]]\n* [[Double margin doors]]\n* [[Electronic lock]]\n* [[Identity document]]\n* [[IP camera]]\n* [[Janus]], Roman god of doors\n* [[Keycard]]s\n* [[Locksmithing]]\n* [[Lock picking]]\n* [[Logical security]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911 |last=Spiers |first=Richard Phen\u00e9 |wstitle=Door |volume=8 |pages=419\u2013420}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Doors}}\n{{Room}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Doors| ]]\n[[Category:Types of gates]]\n[[https://www.thecivilengineeringtopicshindi4u.com/2020/04/types-of-door-in-civil-engineering.html]Types of door]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Doors|the band|The Doors|other uses|Door (disambiguation)}}\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=600\n| image1 = 57 Rue du Faubourg de Pierre (27353042388).jpg\n| image2 = 1 bis place de l'Alma (Paris).jpg\n| image3 = P1250574 Paris V rue Malebranche n3 porte gothique bis encours.jpg\n| image4 = Qila-i-Kuhna mosque side door.jpg\n| image5 = 16, Stationsstraat, Maastricht.jpg|width5=300|height5=\n| image6 = The Marble Temple-Door (Bangkok).jpg\n| footer = Various examples of doors throughout history\n}}\n\nA '''door''' is a [[hinge]]d or otherwise movable barrier that allows ingress and egress into an \"enclosure\". The opening in the [[wall]] can be referred to as a \"portal\". A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide [[security]] by controlling access to the portal (doorway). [[Convention (norm)|Conventionally]], it is a panel that fits into the portal of a [[building]], [[room]], or [[vehicle]]. Doors are generally made of a material suited to the task of which it is to perform. Doors are commonly attached by hinges within the portal but can be moved by other means such as slides or counterbalancing.\n\nThe door may be moved in various ways (at angles away from the portal, by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) to allow or prevent ingress or egress. In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side. But in other cases (e.g., a [[car door|vehicle door]]) the two sides are radically different.\n\n[[File:Clevelandart 1964.91.jpg|thumb|False door of [[Nykara]], c. 2408 BC, painted limestone, 168 x 111.5 x 6 cm, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]\n\nDoors often incorporate [[lock (security device)|locking]] mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them. Doors can have devices such as knockers or [[doorbell]]s by which people outside can announce their presence and summon someone either to open the door for them or give permission to open and enter. Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors can have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing [[light]] to pass into and out of a space, of controlling [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] or [[air draft]]s so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening [[noise]], and of blocking the spread of [[fire]].\n\nDoors may have [[aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[symbol]]ic, [[ritual]]istic purposes. To be given the [[key (lock)|key]] to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider.<ref>See, for example the doorkeeping duties of the [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]].</ref> Doors and doorways frequently appear in [[literature]] and [[the arts]] with [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegory|allegorical]] import as a portent of change.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section contains verbatim text from the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' (1911) article on doors. See References.-->\n\nThe earliest in records are those represented in the paintings of some [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs, in which they are shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there was no fear of their warping, but in other countries it was necessary to frame them, which according to [[Vitruvius]] (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails ''(see: [[Frame and panel]])'': the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, [[Mortise and tenon|tenoned]] or [[hinge]]d, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the top rail, bottom rail, and middle or intermediate rails.\n\nThe most ancient doors were made of timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's temple]] being in [[olive wood]] (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in [[Homer]] appear to have been cased in silver or brass. Besides olive wood, [[elm (wood)|elm]], [[cedar (wood)|cedar]], [[oak (wood)|oak]] and [[cypress (wood)|cypress]] were used. A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in [[Switzerland]].<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ Swiss archaeologists find 5000-year-old door] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108222716/http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 550\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = stone door.jpg\n| width1 =\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Stone door in [[Hampi]] ([[India]])\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Door-Post Socket (4690606141).jpg\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = A massive door socket from [[Persepolis]] (modern-day [[Iran]])\n}}\n\nAll ancient doors were hung by pivots at the top and bottom of the hanging stile which worked in sockets in the [[lintel]] and [[sill plate|sill]], the latter being always in some hard stone such as [[basalt]] or [[granite]]. Those found at [[Nippur]] by Dr. Hilprecht dating from 2000 BC were in [[dolerite]]. The tenons of the [[gate]]s at [[Balawat]] were sheathed with bronze (now in the [[British Museum]]). These doors or gates were hung in two leaves, each about {{convert|2.54|m|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; they were encased with bronze bands or strips, {{convert|25.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, covered with [[repouss\u00e9]] decoration of figures. The wood doors would seem to have been about {{convert|7.62|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, but the hanging stile was over {{convert|360|mm|in}} diameter. Other sheathings of various sizes in bronze have been found, which proves this to have been the universal method adopted to protect the wood pivots. In the [[Hauran]] in Syria, where timber is scarce the doors were made in stone, and one measuring {{convert|1.63|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|0.79|m|in|abbr=on}} is in the British Museum; the band on the meeting stile shows that it was one of the leaves of a double door. At Kuffeir near Bostra in Syria, Burckhardt found stone doors, {{convert|2.74|to|3.048|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, being the entrance doors of the town. In [[Etruria]] many stone doors are referred to by Dennis.\n\n[[File:Plaster cast of folding doors, Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] folding doors at [[Pompeii]], from the 1st century AD, similar with Neoclassical doors from the 19th century]]\n\nAncient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] doors were either single doors, double doors, triple doors, [[sliding door]]s or [[folding door]]s, in the last case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In [[Eumachia]], is a painting of a door with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at [[Agrigentum]] there is a single four-panel door carved in stone. In the Blundell collection is a [[bas-relief]] of a temple with double doors, each leaf with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the [[Santi Cosma e Damiano|church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano]], in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle. Two other bronze doors of the Roman period are in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Lateran Basilica]].\n\nThe Greek scholar [[Heron of Alexandria]] created the earliest known automatic door in the 1st century AD during the era of [[Roman Egypt]].<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 162\">Needham, Joseph.

The doors of the [[church of the Nativity]] at [[Bethlehem]] (6th century) are covered with plates of bronze, cut out in patterns. Those of [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]], of the 8th and 9th century, are wrought in bronze, and the west doors of the cathedral of [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] (9th century), of similar manufacture, were probably brought from Constantinople, as also some of those in [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Marks, Venice]]. The bronze doors on the Aachen Cathedral in Germany date back to about 800 AD. Bronze baptistery doors at the Cathedral of Florence were completed in 1423 by Ghiberti.<ref>Architecture, European Copper Institute; {{cite web |url=http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009005711/http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |archivedate=2012-10-09 }}</ref> ''(For more information, see: [[Copper in architecture]]).''\n\n[[File:T\u00fcr, Villa Boscoreale.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] wall painting of an ornate door, in the [[Villa Boscoreale]] ([[Italy]]), from the 1st century AD]]\n\nOf the 11th and 12th centuries there are numerous examples of bronze doors, the earliest being one at [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]] (1015). The Hildesheim design affected the concept of [[Gniezno Doors|Gniezno door]] in Poland. Of others in South Italy and Sicily, the following are the finest: in Sant Andrea, [[Amalfi]] (1060); [[Salerno]] (1099); [[Canosa]] (1111); [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], two doors (1119 and 1124); [[Ravello]] (1179), by Barisano of Trani, who also made doors for [[Trani]] cathedral; and in [[Monreale]] and [[Duomo di Pisa|Pisa]] cathedrals, by Bonano of Pisa. In all these cases the hanging stile had pivots at the top and bottom. The exact period when the hinge was substituted is not quite known, but the change apparently brought about another method of strengthening and decorating doors, viz, with wrought-iron bands of infinite varieties of design. As a rule three bands from which the ornamental work springs constitute the hinges, which have rings outside the hanging stiles fitting on to vertical tenons run into the masonry or wooden frame. There is an early example of the 12th century in [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]]; in France the metal work of the doors of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] at Paris is perhaps the most beautiful in execution, but examples are endless throughout France and England.\n\nReturning to Italy, the most celebrated doors are those of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)]], which together with the door frames are all in bronze, the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable: the modeling of the figures, birds and foliage of the south doorway, by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330), and of the east doorway by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] (1425\u20131452), are of great beauty; in the north door (1402\u20131424) Ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as Andrea Pisano, but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled, with bas-reliefs, in which Scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures, these being probably the gates of Paradise of which [[Michelangelo]] speaks.\n\nThe doors of the mosques in [[Cairo]] were of two kinds; those which, externally, were cased with sheets of bronze or iron, cut out in decorative patterns, and incised or inlaid, with bosses in relief; and those in wood, which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond, this latter description of work being [[Copt]]ic in its origin. The doors of the palace at [[Palermo]], which were made by Saracenic workmen for the [[Normans]], are fine examples and in good preservation. A somewhat similar decorative class of door to these latter is found in [[Verona]], where the edges of the stiles and rails are beveled and notched.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433.JPG|thumb|Glass door decorated with [[Art Nouveau]] elements, from the [[Singer House]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nIn the Renaissance period the Italian doors are quite simple, their architects trusting more to the doorways for effect; but in France and Germany the contrary is the case, the doors being elaborately carved, especially in the [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] periods, and sometimes with architectural features such as columns and entablatures with pediment and niches, the doorway being in plain masonry. While in Italy the tendency was to give scale by increasing the number of panels, in France the contrary seems to have been the rule; and one of the great doors at [[Fontainebleau]], which is in two leaves, is entirely carried out as if consisting of one great panel only.\n\nThe earliest [[Renaissance]] doors in France are those of the [[Aix Cathedral|cathedral of St. Sauveur]] at [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] (1503). In the lower panels there are figures {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[niche (architecture)|niches]], and in the upper panels a double range of niches with figures about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high with canopies over them, all carved in [[cedrus|cedar]]. The south door of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] is in some respects the finest in France; the upper panels are carved in high relief with figure subjects and canopies over them. The doors of the church at [[Gisors]] (1575) are carved with figures in niches subdivided by classic pilasters superimposed. In St. Maclou at [[Rouen]] are three magnificently carved doors; those by Jean Goujon have figures in niches on each side, and others in a group of great beauty in the center. The other doors, probably about forty to fifty years later, are enriched with [[bas-reliefs]], landscapes, figures and elaborate interlaced borders.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at the Kennedy Space Center contains the four largest doors.

Traditionally the top half can be opened to allow a [[horse]] or other animal to be fed, while the bottom half remains closed to keep the animal inside. This style of door has been adapted for homes.\n* '''[[Western saloon|Saloon]] doors''' are a pair of lightweight swing doors often found in public bars, and especially associated with the American west. Saloon doors, also known as '''[[wikt:cafe|cafe]] doors''', often use bidirectional [[hinge]]s that close the door regardless of which direction it is opened by incorporating [[spring (device)|springs]]. Saloon doors that only extend from knee-level to chest-level are known as '''batwing doors'''.\n* A '''blind door''', '''Gibb door''', or '''jib door''' has no visible trim or operable components. It is designed to blend with the adjacent wall in all finishes, and visually to be a part of the wall, a disguised door.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Peter |title=The New and Improved Practical Builder |location=London |publisher=Thomas Kelly|date=1841 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n* A '''French door''' consists of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a '''French window''', as it resembles a door-height [[casement window]]. When a pair of French doors is used as a French window, the application does not generally include a central [[mullion]] (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An [[espagnolette]] bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.\n* A '''[[louvred door]]''' has fixed or movable wooden fins (often called slats or [[louver]]s) which permit open ventilation while preserving privacy and preventing the passage of light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for [[wardrobe]]s and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form [[window shutter]]s. Double louvred doors were introduced into ''[[Powel Crosley, Jr.#Seagate in Florida|Seagate]]'', built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy in that it is impossible to see through the fins in any direction.\n* A '''composite door''' is a single leaf door that can be solid or with glass, and is usually filled with high density foam. In the United Kingdom, it is common for composite doors to be certified to BS PAS 23/24<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean/|title=What does 'certificated' to PAS 24 actually mean?|work=thecrimepreventionwebsite.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125223650/http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean|archivedate=2014-01-25}}</ref> and be compliant with Secured by Design, an official UK police initiative.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doors and Locks |url=https://www.securedbydesign.com/guidance/standards-explained#doors-and-locks |website=Secured by Design |publisher=Police Crime Prevention Initiative |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n* A '''steel security door''' is one which is made from strong steel, often for use on [[Bank vault|vaults]] and [[safe room]]s to withstand attack. These may also be fitted with wooden outer panels to resemble standard internal and external doors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|title=Henleys Security Doors|website=Henleys Security Doors|access-date=25 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530035319/http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|archivedate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n* A '''flush door''' is a completely smooth door, having [[plywood]] or [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] fixed over a light timber frame, the hollow parts of which are often filled with a cardboard core material. Skins can also be made out of hardboards, the first of which was invented by William H Mason in 1924. Called [[Masonite]], its construction involved pressing and steaming wood chips into boards. Flush doors are most commonly employed in the interior of a dwelling, although slightly more substantial versions are occasionally used as exterior doors, especially within hotels and other buildings containing many independent dwellings.\n* A '''moulded door''' has the same structure as that of flush door. The only difference is that the surface material is a moulded skin made of MDF. Skins can also be made out of [[Masonite|hardboards]].\n* A '''ledge and brace door''' often called board and batten doors are made from multiple vertical boards fixed together by two or more horizontal timbers called ledges (or battens)and sometimes kept square by additional diagonal timbers called braces.\n* A '''[[wicket gate|wicket door]]''' is a pedestrian door built into a much larger door allowing access without requiring the opening of the larger door. Examples might be found on the ceremonial door of a cathedral or in a large vehicle door in a garage or hangar.\n* A '''bifold door'''<span id=\"bifold\"></span><!-- The preceding tag is a target for links on other pages, probably including the Dab [[Folding]]. --> is a unit that has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood is the most common material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most commonly made for [[closet]]s, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|title=Front Doors, Garage Doors Insights from The Door Zone|website=The Door Zone|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507074631/http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|archivedate=2017-05-07}}</ref>\n* A '''[[sliding glass door]]''', sometimes called an Arcadia door or patio door, is a door made of [[glass]] that slides open and sometimes has a screen (a removable metal mesh that covers the door).\n* '''Australian doors''' are a pair of plywood swinging doors often found in Australian public houses. These doors are generally red or brown in color and bear a resemblance to the more formal doors found in other British Colonies' public houses.\n* A '''false door''' is a wall decoration that looks like a window. In ancient [[Egyptian architecture]], this was a common element in a tomb, the false door representing a gate to the afterlife. They can also be found in the funerary architecture of the desert tribes (e.g., [[Libya]]n Ghirza).\n* A '''[[Mat|doormat]]''' (also called door mat) is a mat placed typically in front of or behind a door of a home. This practice originated so that mud and dirt would be less prevalent on floors inside a building.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170\" heights=\"170\">\nBronze door, Basilica di San Giovanni, 2013.jpg|[[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] bronze doors of the [[Curia Julia]], now in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (Rome)\n\nDoorway detail, St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney.jpg|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] door of the [[St Magnus Cathedral]] ([[Kirkwall]], [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom|UK]])\n\nFile:Door in Morocco, 2010.jpg|An Islamic door decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], in [[Morocco]]\n\nFile:Brooklyn Museum 1994.92 Door with Lock (2).jpg|Door with lock, late 19th or early 20th century, wood with iron, from [[Burkina Faso]], in the [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City)\n\nFile:Amsterdam (NL), Kloveniersburgwal -- 2015 -- 7252.jpg|Door of the Laboratorium voor Artsenijbereidkunde, an example of Dutch [[Renaissance architecture]], in [[Amsterdam]] (the [[Netherlands]])\n\nFile:Bohemian court chancellery door - Vienna.jpg|[[Baroque]] entrance in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]])\n\nLe portail du Palais Rohan (14456681043).jpg|Detail of a [[Rococo]] of the [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg|Palais Rohan]] from [[Strasbourg]] (France)\n\nFile:Porte d'entr\u00e9e du palais de Justice de Bruxelles (HDR) - 2043-0077-0.jpg|[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] door of the main entrance of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] ([[Brussels]], Belgium)\n\nSimple door inside the BCR Headquarters Building, in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|Neoclassical door without ornaments, in the BCR Headquarters Building from Bucharest\n\nFile:Tsentralny District, St Petersburg, Russia - panoramio (259).jpg|[[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian Revival]] door from [[Saint Petersburg]] (Russia)\n\n9, Strada Sp\u0103tarului, Bucharest (Romania) 1.jpg|Double door of a city-house from [[Bucharest]] (Romania)\n\nAn entrance of the National Museum of Romanian History, in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|A door of the [[National Museum of Romanian History]] (Bucharest)\n\nPorte et marquise CCI Nancy.jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] metal and glass door in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (France), with a big transparent [[awning]] above it\n\nFile:Maison Huot de style art nouveau (Nancy) (7965996816).jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] door from Nancy\n\nFile:Tenghua Jiuguan 21 2015-04.JPG|Traditional folding doors in [[The Old Museum of Wisteria]] ([[Changzhou]], China)\n\nFile:Zesp\u00f3\u0142 klasztoru Gandan (39).jpg|A decorated door from the [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery]] (Mongolia)\n</gallery>\n\n== Different types of door mechanism ==\n[[File:Types of doors.png|thumb|The main types of door mechanisms]]\n\n=== Hinged doors ===\nMost doors are [[hinge]]d along one side to allow the door to pivot away from the doorway in one direction, but not the other. The axis of rotation is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged [[garage door]]s, the axis may be horizontal, above the door opening.\n\nDoors can be hinged so that the axis of rotation is not in the plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the door opens. This requires a mechanism so that the axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the door opens. This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as for the door to the toilet, which opens inward.\n\nA '''swing door''' has special single-action hinges that allow it to open either outwards or inwards, and is usually sprung to keep it closed.\n\n'''French doors''' are derived from an original French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels would be in a casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel at the bottom of the door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.\n\nA '''Mead door''', developed by S Mead of Leicester, swings both ways. It is susceptible to forced entry due to its design.\n\nA '''Dutch door''' or stable door consists of two halves. The top half operates independently from the bottom half. A variant exists in which opening the top part separately is possible, but because the lower part has a lip on the inside, closing the top part, while leaving the lower part open, is not.\n\nA '''garden door''' resembles a French window (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the operating door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch is located at the wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an [[espagnolette]] bolt.\n\n=== Sliding doors ===\nIt is often useful to have doors which slide along tracks, often for space or aesthetic considerations.\n\nA '''bypass door''' is a door unit that has two or more sections. The doors can slide in either direction along one axis on parallel overhead tracks, sliding past each other. They are most commonly used in closets, in order to access one side of the closet at a time. The doors in a bypass unit will overlap slightly when viewed from the front, in order not to have a visible gap between them.\n\nDoors which slide inside a wall cavity are called '''[[pocket door]]s'''. This type of door is used in tight spaces where privacy is also required. The door slab is mounted to roller and a track at the top of the door and slides inside a wall.\n\nSliding glass doors are common in many houses, particularly as an entrance to the backyard. Such doors are also popular for use for the entrances to commercial structures, although they are not counted as fire exit doors. The door that moves is called the \"active leaf\", while the door that remains fixed is called the \"inactive leaf\".\n\n=== Rotating doors ===\nA '''[[revolving door]]''' has several wings or leaves, generally four, radiating from a central shaft, forming compartments that rotate about a vertical axis. A revolving door allows people to pass in both directions without colliding, and forms an airlock maintaining a seal between inside and out.\n\nA '''pivot door''', instead of hinges, is supported on a bearing some distance away from the edge, so that there is more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the opening side. In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.\n\n=== High-speed door ===\nA '''[[high-speed door]]''' is a very fast door some with opening speeds of up to 4&nbsp;m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where the speed of a door has an effect on production logistics, temperature and pressure control. high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded.\n\nHigh-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200,000 a year. They need to be built with heavy-duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections. High Speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the [[Green energy|Green]] and [[Energy saving]] requirements.\n\nIn North America, the Door and Access Systems Manufacturing Association (DASMA) defines high-performance doors as non-residential, powered doors, characterized by rolling, folding, sliding or swinging action, that are either high-cycle (minimum 100 cycles/day) or high-speed (minimum 20 inches(508&nbsp;mm)/second), and two out of three of the following: made-to-order for exact size and custom features, designed to be able to withstand equipment impact (break-away if accidentally hit by vehicle) or designed to sustain heavy usage with minimal maintenance.\n\n=== Automatic ===\n'''[[Automatic door|Automatically opening doors]]''' are powered open and closed either by electricity, spring, or both. There are several methods by which an automatically opening door is activated:\n\n# A [[sensor]] detects traffic is approaching. Sensors for automatic doors are generally:\n#* A [[pressure sensor]] \u2013 e.g., a floor mat which reacts to the pressure of someone standing on it.\n#* An [[infrared]] [[curtain]] or beam which shines invisible light onto sensors; if someone or something blocks the beam the door is triggered open.\n#* A [[motion sensor]] which uses low-power microwave [[radar]] for the same effect.\n#* A remote sensor (e.g. based on infrared or radio waves) can be triggered by a portable [[remote control]], or is installed inside a vehicle. These are popular for garage doors.\n# A [[switch]] is operated manually, perhaps after security checks. This can be a push button switch or a swipe card.\n# The act of pushing or pulling the door triggers the open and close cycle. These are also known as power-assisted doors.\n\nIn addition to activation sensors automatically opening doors are generally fitted with safety sensors. These are usually an infrared curtain or beam, but can be a pressure mat fitted on the swing side of the door. The purpose of the safety sensor is to prevent the door from colliding with an object in its path by stopping or slowing its motion.A mechanism is set in modern automatic doors to ensure that door will be in open state in case of power failure.\n\n=== Others ===\n[[Image:Puertas seccionales.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Sectional doors for industry.]]\n[[File:Torggler evolutiondoor.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|''Evolution Door'', 2013]]\n'''Up-and-over''' or '''overhead''' doors are often used in garages. Instead of hinges it has a mechanism, often [[counterbalance]]d or [[torsion spring|sprung]], that allows it to be lifted so that it rests horizontally above the opening. A [[roller shutter]] or '''sectional overhead door''' is one variant of this type.\n\nA '''[[tambour door]]''' or roller door is an up-and-over door made of narrow horizontal slats and \"rolls\" up and down by sliding along vertical tracks and is typically found in entertainment centres and cabinets.\n\n'''Inward opening doors''' are doors that can only be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a substantial fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards in the event of an emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.\n\n'''Rebated doors''', a term chiefly used in Britain, are double doors having a lip or overlap (i.e. a [[Rabbet]]) on the vertical edge(s) where they meet. Fire-rating can be achieved with an applied edge-guard or astragal molding on the meeting stile, in accordance with the American [[Fire door]].\n\n'''Evolution Door''' is a trackless door that moves in the same closure level as a sliding door. The system is an invention of the Austrian artist Klemens Torggler. It is a further development of the '''{{ill|Drehplattent\u00fcr|de|Drehplattent\u00fcr|vertical-align=sup}}''' that normally consists of two rotatable, connected panels which move to each other when opening.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|title=Kinematics with MicroStation Ch01C-I Grueblers Criteria for 3D 5 Bar|date=20 February 2014|work=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409090618/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|archivedate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Miersch, 17 rue Nicolas Welter-001.jpg|thumb|250px|Transparent awning in [[Luxembourg]]]]\nArchitectural doors have numerous general and specialized uses. Doors are generally used to separate interior spaces (closets, rooms, etc.) for [[convenience]], [[privacy]], [[safety]], and [[security]] reasons. Doors are also used to secure passages into a building from the exterior, for reasons of [[climate]] control and safety.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nDoors also are applied in more specialized cases:\n* A '''[[blast door|Blast-proof door]]''' is constructed to allow access to a structure as well as to provide protection from the force of explosions.\n* A '''garden door''' is any door that opens to a backyard or [[garden]]. This term is often used specifically for French windows, double French doors (with lites instead of panels), in place of a [[sliding glass door]]. The term also may refer to what is known as ''patio doors''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A jib door is a concealed door, whose surface reflects the moldings and finishes of the wall. These were used in historic English houses, mainly as servants' doors.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A '''[[pet door]]''' (also known as a [[cat flap]] or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a [[rubber]] flap, or it may be an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only allowing pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.\n* A '''[[trapdoor]]''' is a door that is oriented horizontally in a [[ceiling]] or [[floor]], often accessed via a [[ladder]].\n* A '''water door''' or '''water entrance''', such as those used in [[Venice, Italy]], is a door leading from a building built on the water, such as a canal, to the water itself where, for example, one may enter or exit a private boat or [[water taxi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|website=See Venice, Italy|title=Doors in Venice: among water, art and architecture|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103074300/http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|archivedate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>Water doors make frequent appearances in [[Donna Leon]]'s books, and in some are important plot devices, as in [[Donna Leon#Commissario Guido Brunetti novels|''Acqua Alta'' aka ''Death in High Water'' (1996) and ''Beastly Things'' (2012)]].</ref>\n\n== Construction and components ==\n[[File:Door-glossary.png|thumb|Parts of a panel or glazed door]]\n[[File:Door-midrail-detail.png|thumb|Joint between midrail, lockrail and a gunstock stile]]\n[[File:Frame-filled-door.gif|thumb|A frame and filled door]]\n[[File:hollow door.jpg|thumb|A hollow door with one face removed]]\n\n=== Panel doors ===\nPanel doors, also called stile and rail doors, are built with [[frame and panel]] construction. EN 12519 is describing the terms which are officially used in European Member States. The main parts are listed below:\n* [[Stile]]s \u2013 Vertical boards that run the full height of a door and compose its right and left edges. The hinges are mounted to the fixed side (known as the \"hanging stile\"), and the handle, lock, bolt or latch are mounted on the swinging side (known as the \"latch stile\").\n* [[Frame and panel|Rails]] \u2013 Horizontal boards at the top, bottom, and optionally in the middle of a door that join the two stiles and split the door into two or more rows of panels. The \"top rail\" and \"bottom rail\" are named for their positions. The bottom rail is also known as \"kick rail\". A middle rail at the height of the bolt is known as the \"lock rail\", other middle rails are commonly known as \"cross rails\".\n* [[Mullion]]s \u2013 Smaller optional vertical boards that run between two rails, and split the door into two or more columns of panels, the term is used sometimes for verticals in doors, but more often (UK and Australia) it refers to verticals in windows.\n* Muntin \u2013 Optional vertical members that divide the door into smaller panels.\n* Panels \u2013 Large, wider boards used to fill the space between the stiles, rails, and mullions. The panels typically fit into grooves in the other pieces, and help to keep the door rigid. Panels may be flat, or in raised panel designs. Can be glued in or stay as a floating panel.\n* Light \u2013 a piece of glass used in place of a panel, essentially giving the door a window.\n\n=== Board batten doors ===\nAlso known as ledges and braced,\nBoard and batten doors are an older design consisting primarily of vertical slats:\n* Planks \u2013 Boards wider than 9\" that extend the full height of the door, and are placed side by side filling the door's width.\n* Ledges and braces \u2013 Ledges extend horizontally across the door which the boards are affixed to. The ledges hold the planks together. When diagonally they are called braces which prevent the door from skewing. On some doors, especially antique ones, the ledges are replaced with iron bars that are often built into the hinges as extensions of the door-side plates.\n\n=== Ledged and braced doors ===\nAs board and Batten doors\n\n=== Impact-resistant doors ===\nImpact-resistant doors have rounded stile edges to dissipate energy and minimize edge chipping, scratching and denting. The formed edges are often made of an engineered material. Impact-resistant doors excel in high traffic areas such as hospitals, schools, hotels and coastal areas.\n\n=== Frame and filled doors ===\nThis type consists of a solid timber frame, filled on one face, face with Tongue and Grooved boards. Quite often used externally with the boards on the weather face.\n\n=== Flush doors ===\nMany modern doors, including most interior doors, are flush doors:\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* Core material: Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce drumminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core flush doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board and batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are then covered with [[wood veneer]], thin [[plywood]], [[sheet metal]], [[fiberglass]], or [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]]. The wooden materials are usually layered with the grain alternating direction between layers to prevent warping. Fiberglass and metal-faced doors are sometimes given a layer of cellulose so that they may be stained to look like wood.\n\n=== Moulded doors ===\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* '''Core material''': Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce druminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], extruded polystyrene foam, or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core molded doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board & batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are covered with HDF / [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] skins.\n\n=== Swing direction ===\n'''Door swings'''\n[[File:Art Nouveau entrance in Pia\u021ba Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu (Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Square), from Bucharest (Romania).jpg|thumb|225px|[[Art Nouveau]] door in [[Bucharest]] (Romania), with a [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]] above it]]\nFor most of the world {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}, door swings, or handing, are determined while standing on the outside or less secure side of the door while facing the door (i.e., standing on the side requiring a key to open, going from outside to inside, or from public to private).\n\nIt is especially important to get the hand and swing correct on exterior doors, as the transom is usually sloped and sealed to resist water entry, and to properly drain. In some custom [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] (or with some master carpenters), the manufacture or installer will bevel the leading edge (the first edge to meet the jamb as the door is closing) so that the door fits tight without binding. Specifying an incorrect hand or swing will cause the door to bind, not close properly or leak (for exterior doors). Fixing this specification error will be expensive or time-consuming. In North America, many doors now come with factory-installed hinges, pre-hung on the jamb and sills.\n\nWhile facing the door from the outside or less secure side, if the hinge is on the right side of the door, the door is \"right handed\"; or if the hinge is on the left, it is \"left handed\". If the door swings toward you, it is \"reverse swing\"; or if the door swings away from you, it is \"Normal swing\".\n\nIn other words,\n*In the United States:\n** '''Left hand hinge (LHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side, or on the public side of the door), the hinges are on the left and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Right hand hinge (RHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Left hand reverse (LHR):''' Standing outside the house (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the left, knob on right, on opening the door it swings towards you (i.e. the door swings open towards the outside, or \"outswing\")\n** '''Right hand reverse (RHR):''' Standing outside the house (i.e. on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right, knob on left, opening the door by pulling the door towards you (i.e. open swings to the outside, or \"outswing\")\n*In Europe:\nOne of the oldest [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]] standard applies: DIN 107 \"Building construction; identification of right and left side\" (first 1922\u201305, current 1974-04) defines that '''doors are categorized from the side where the door hinges can be seen'''. If the hinges are on the left, it is a DIN Left door (DIN links, DIN gauche), if the hinges are on the right, it is a DIN Right door (DIN rechts, DIN droite). The DIN Right and DIN Left marking are also used to categorize matching installation material such as [[mortise lock]]s (referenced in DIN 107). The European Standard DIN EN 12519 \"Windows and pedestrian doors. Terminology\" includes these definitions of orientation.\n*In Australia:\nThe \"refrigerator rule\" applies, and a refrigerator door is not opened from the inside. If the hinges are on the right then it is a right hand (or right hung) door. (Australian Standards for Installation of Timber Doorsets, AS 1909\u20131984 pg 6.)\n\nIn public buildings, exterior doors should open to the outside in order to comply with any fire codes that may be in force in that jurisdiction. If the door opens inward and there is a fire, there can be a crush of people who run for the door and they will not be able to open it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|title=Why do the entry doors to most homes open inward, while in most public buildings, the entry doors open outward?|date=2001-03-02|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920044229/http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|archivedate=2017-09-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Types ===\nNew exterior doors are largely defined by the type of materials they are made from: [[wood]], [[steel]], [[fiberglass]], [[UPVC]]/vinyl, [[aluminum]], composite, [[Glass|glass (patio doors)]]...\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 350\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 =Strasbourg 1 rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Castelnau (2).jpg \n| width1 = 140\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Wooden door of a building from [[Strasbourg]] (France), decorated with [[pediment]]s on it\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Pierre Rousseau - Double-Leaf Doors - 1942.2.12.a - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] double-leaf doors by [[Pierre Rousseau]], 1790s\n}}\n[[File:Glass and metal door on Calea Victoriei (Victory's Avenue) in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|200px|right|thumb|Glass and metal door, decoarted with Neoclassical ornaments, in [[Bucharest]] (Romania)]]\n'''Wooden doors''' \u2013 including solid wood doors \u2013 are a top choice for many homeowners, largely because of the aesthetic qualities of wood. Many wood doors are custom-made, but they have several downsides: their price, their maintenance requirements (regular painting and staining) and their limited insulating value<ref>Exterior Doors; Energy.gov; {{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304181502/http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |archivedate=2015-03-04 }}</ref> (R-5 to R-6, not including the effects of the glass elements of the doors). Wood doors often have an overhang requirement to maintain a warranty. An overhang is a roof, porch area or awning that helps to protect the door and its finish from [[Ultraviolet|UV]] rays.\n\n'''Steel doors''' are another major type of residential front doors; most of them come with a [[polyurethane]] or other type of [[foam]] insulation core \u2013 a critical factor in a building's overall comfort and efficiency. Steel doors mostly in default comes along with frame and lock system, which is a high cost efficiency factor compared to ''Wooden doors''\n\nMost modern exterior walls are designed to provide [[thermal insulation]] and [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]], which can be indicated by the [[Energy Star]] label or the [[Passive House]] standards. Premium '''composite''' (including steel doors with a thick core of polyurethane or other foam), '''fiberglass''' and '''vinyl doors''' benefit from the materials they are made from, from a thermal perspective.\n\n=== Insulation and weatherstrips ===\n{{Context|section|date=November 2015}}\nBut there are very few door models with an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] close to 10 (which is far less than the R-40 walls or the R-50 ceilings of super-insulated buildings \u2013 [[Passive Solar]] and [[Zero-energy building|Zero Energy Buildings]]). Typical doors are not thick enough to provide very high levels of energy efficiency.\n\nMany doors may have good R-values at their center, but their overall energy efficiency is reduced because of the presence of glass and reinforcing elements, or because of poor [[weatherstripping]] and the way the door is manufactured.\n\nDoor weatherstripping is particularly important for energy efficiency. German-made Passive House doors use multiple weatherstrips, including magnetic strips, to meet higher standards. These weatherstrips are critical to reduce to a minimum energy losses due to air leakage.\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n{{Globalize|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== United States ====\nThe standard door sizes in the US run along 2\" increments. Customary sizes have a height of 78\" (1981&nbsp;mm) or 80\" (2032&nbsp;mm) and a width of 18\" (472&nbsp;mm), 24\" (610&nbsp;mm), 26\" (660&nbsp;mm), 28\" (711&nbsp;mm), 30\" (762&nbsp;mm) or 36\" (914&nbsp;mm).<ref>options at homedepot.com</ref> Most residential passage (room to room) doors are 30\" x 80\" (762&nbsp;mm x 2032&nbsp;mm).\n\nA standard US residential (exterior) door size is 36\" x 80\" (91 x 203&nbsp;cm). Interior doors for wheelchair access must also have a minimum width of 3'-0\" (91&nbsp;cm). Residential interior doors are often somewhat smaller being 6'-8\" high, as are many small stores, offices, and other light commercial buildings. Larger commercial, public buildings and grand homes often use doors of greater height. Older buildings often have smaller doors.\n\nThickness: Most pre-fabricated doors are 1 3/8\" thick (for interior doors) or 1 3/4\" (exterior).\n\n'''Closets:''' small spaces such as closets, dressing rooms, half-baths, storage rooms, cellars, etc. often are accessed through doors smaller than passage doors in one or both dimensions but similar in design.\n\n'''Garages:''' Garage doors are generally 7'-0\" or 8'-0\" wide for a single-car opening. Two car garage doors (sometimes called double car doors) are a single door 16'-0\". Because of size and weight these doors are usually sectional. That is split into four or five horizontal sections so that they can be raised more easily and don't require a lot of additional space above the door when opening and closing. There are single piece double garage doors found in some older homes. circa 1950's\n\n==== Europe ====\nThe standard DIN doors are defined in DIN 18101 (published 1955\u201307, 1985\u201301, 2014-08). The door sizes are also given in the construction standard for wooden door panels (DIN 68706-1). The DIN commission was also responsible for the harmonized European standard DIN EN 14351-1 for exterior doors and DIN EN 14351-2 for interior doors (published 2006\u201307, 2010-08), which defines the requirements for the [[CE marking]] giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix.\n\nThe DIN 18101 standard has a normative size (Nennma\u00df) slightly larger than the panel size (T\u00fcrblatt) as the standard derives the panel sizes from the normative size being different single door vs double door and molded vs unmolded doors. The DIN 18101/1985 defines interior single molded doors to have a common panel height of 1985&nbsp;mm (normativ height 2010&nbsp;mm) at panel widths of 610&nbsp;mm, 735&nbsp;mm, 860&nbsp;mm, 985&nbsp;mm, 1110&nbsp;mm, plus a larger door panel size of 1110&nbsp;mm x 2110&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|title=T\u00fcrblattgr\u00f6\u00dfen nach DIN 18101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219203924/http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|archivedate=2015-02-19}}</ref> The newer DIN 18101/2014 drops the definition of just five standard door sizes in favor of a basic raster running along 125&nbsp;mm increments where the height and width are independent. The panel width may be in the range 485&nbsp;mm to 1360 mmm, and the height may be in the range of 1610&nbsp;mm to 2735&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeg-holz.de/news/aktuelle-news/article/17/din-18101-ma.html?no_cache=1|title=DIN 18101 Ma\u00dfnorm f\u00fcr T\u00fcren grundlegend \u00fcberarbeitet|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122032619/http://www.zeg-holz.de/news/aktuelle-news/article/17/din-18101-ma.html?no_cache=1|archivedate=2015-01-22}}</ref> The most common interior door is 860&nbsp;mm x 1985&nbsp;mm (33.8\" x 78.1\").\n\n=== Doorway components ===\n[[File:Panel door.jpg|right|thumb|A diagram illustrating the components of a panel door]]\nWhen framed in wood for snug fitting of a door, the doorway consists of two vertical ''jambs'' on either side, a ''lintel'' or ''head jamb'' at the top, and perhaps a ''threshold'' at the bottom. When a door has more than one movable section, one of the sections may be called a ''leaf''. See [[door furniture]] for a discussion of attachments to doors such as [[door handle]]s, [[doorknob]]s, and [[door knocker]]s.\n* [[Lintel]] \u2013 A horizontal beam above a door that supports the wall above it. (Also known as a ''header'')\n* [[Jamb]]s or legs \u2013 The vertical posts that form the sides of a door frame, where the hinges are mounted, and with which the bolt interacts.\n* Sill (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal [[sill plate]] below the door that supports the door frame. Similar to a [[Window Sill]] but for a door\n* [[Threshold (door)|Threshold]] (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal plate below the door that bridges the crack between the interior floor and the sill.\n* [[Doorstop]] \u2013 a thin slat built inside the frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed, an act which might break the hinges.\n* [[Architrave]] \u2013 The decorative [[molding (decorative)|molding]] that outlines a door frame. (called an [[Archivolt]] if the door is arched). Called ''door casing'' or ''brickmold'' in North America.\n\n=== Related hardware ===\n{{Main|Door furniture}}\n[[File:Door lock.jpg|thumb|Front door of a house with typical [[door furniture]]: a [[letter box]], [[door knocker]], a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] and two [[Lock (security device)|locks]]]]\n[[File:Paris Rue de Douai5134.JPG|thumb|A door knocker with [[putti]]s holding a [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]], in Paris]]\n\nDoor furniture or hardware refers to any of the items that are attached to a door or a drawer to enhance its functionality or appearance. This includes items such as hinges, handles, door stops, etc.\n\n== Related accidents ==\n'''Door safety''' relates to prevention of door-related [[accident]]s. Such accidents take place in various forms, and in a number of locations; ranging from car doors to garage doors. Accidents vary in severity and frequency. According to the [[National Safety Council]] in the [[United States]], 300,000 injuries are caused by doors every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|title=Protecting Children\u2019s Fingers from Door Injuries|work=The Redwoods Group|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324033919/http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24}}</ref>\n\nThe types of accidents vary from relatively minor cases where doors cause damage to other objects, such as walls, to serious cases resulting in human injury, particularly to fingers, hands, and feet. A closing door can exert up to 40 [[ton]]s per square inch of [[pressure]] between the [[hinge]]s. Because of the number of accidents taking place, there has been a surge in the number of [[lawsuit]]s. Thus organisations may be at risk when car doors or doors within buildings are unprotected.\n\nAccording to the US [[General Services Administration]], discussing child care centres:\n{{quote|...It is essential that children's fingers be protected from being crushed or otherwise injured in the hinge space of a swinging door or gate. There are simple devices available to attach to the hinge side, ensuring that this type of injury does not occur. As the door closes, the hand is pushed out of the opening, away from harm. In addition, young children are vulnerable to injury when they fall against the other (hinged) side of doors and gates, striking projected hinges. Piano hinges are not recommended to alleviate this problem as they tend to sag over time with heavy use. Instead, an inexpensive device fitting over hinges is available on the market and should be used to ensure safety...<ref>USA General Services Administration Child Care Center Design Guide, June 1998</ref>}}\n\n=== Outward and inward opening ===\nWhenever a door is opened outwards there is a risk that it could strike another person. In many cases this can be avoided by [[architectural design]] which favors doors which open inwards into rooms (from the perspective of a common area such as a corridor, the door opens outwards). In cases where this is infeasible, it may be possible to avoid an accident by placing [[vision panel]]s in the door.<ref>Home Safety Guidelines for Architects & Builders, NBS GCR 78-156, BOSTI, December 1978</ref>\n\nHowever, inward-hinged doors can also escalate an accident by preventing people from escaping the building: people inside the building may press against the doors, and thus prevent the doors from opening. Related accidents include:\n* [[Grue Church fire]] - Grue, Norway in 1822\n* [[Victoria Hall Disaster]] - Sunderland, UK in 1883\n* [[Glen Cinema disaster]] - Paisley, UK in 1929\n* [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] - Boston, USA in 1942\n\nToday, the exterior doors of most large (especially public) buildings open outward, while interior doors such as doors to individual rooms, offices, suites, etc. open inward, as do many exterior doors of houses, particularly in North America.\n\n=== Doorstops ===\n[[Doorstop]]s are simple devices used to prevent a door from coming into contact with another object (typically a wall). Without the door stop damage might be done to the wall. They may either absorb the force of a moving door, or hold the door in place to prevent unintended motion.\n\n=== Door guards ===\nThe purpose of door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger trapping devices, or finger guards) is to reduce the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.\n\nThere are various levels of door protection. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear hinge pin side of the door unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.\nWhich level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a [[risk assessment]] of the door.\n\nThere is also handle-side door protection, which prevents the door from slamming shut on the frame, which can cause injury to fingers/hands.\n\n=== Safety doors ===\nA safety door prevents finger injuries near the hinges without the use of door guards. Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular (\"bull-nose\" shaped) extension to the door, which moves in and out of a cavity as the door opens and closes. This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges \u2013 either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a [[doorstop]]).\n\n=== Glass doors ===\n[[Arcadia door|Glass doors]] pose the risk of unintentional collision if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, [[sticker]]s or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface to make it more visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated, tempered or toughened glass.\n\n=== Fire ===\n{{Main|Fire door}}\n\nSpecial purpose fire doors are often employed in buildings to reduce the overall risk of fire, particularly by preventing the spread of fire and smoke. In cases where they are improperly installed, employed, or tampered with, the risk of fire can be increased. [[Door closer]]s are sometimes used to ensure fire doors remain closed.\n\nAn additional risk in a fire is that doors may prevent access to [[emergency service]]s personnel in order to fight the fire, rescue occupants, etc. [[Door breaching]] techniques may be required in these situations to gain access.\n\n[[Panic bar]]s are often used in buildings so that a door locked from the exterior can quickly and easily be opened from the inside in the event of a fire or other emergency.\n\n=== Vehicle doors ===\n{{Main|Vehicle door}}\nThere may be an increased risk of trapping hands or fingers in car doors compared to other types of doors, due to the proximity in which the occupant sits. In some car accidents, injury to occupants from the movement of car doors may occur.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nBicyclists cycling on public roads fear [[dooring]]: collision with an abruptly opened vehicle door. Because cyclists often ride near parked cars along the side of the road they are particularly vulnerable.\n\n=== Aircraft doors ===\nDoors which lead from interior, pressurized, sections of an aircraft to exterior or unpressurized areas can pose extreme risk if they are inadvertently opened during flight. This can be mitigated by having doors that open inwardly and are designed to be forced into their door frames by the internal cabin pressure \u2013 most cabin doors are of this type. However, an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space, and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure.\n\nA number of accidents have occurred where outward-opening aircraft doors were opened in flight, often accidentally:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 96]] (1972)\n* [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] (1974)\n* [[United Airlines Flight 811]] (1989)\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Hinge bender]], a tool for adjusting door hinges\n* [[Biometrics]]\n* [[Closed-circuit television]]\n* [[Coal hole]]\n* [[Door security]]\n* [[Double margin doors]]\n* [[Electronic lock]]\n* [[Identity document]]\n* [[IP camera]]\n* [[Janus]], Roman god of doors\n* [[Keycard]]s\n* [[Locksmithing]]\n* [[Lock picking]]\n* [[Logical security]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911 |last=Spiers |first=Richard Phen\u00e9 |wstitle=Door |volume=8 |pages=419\u2013420}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Doors}}\n{{Room}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Doors| ]]\n[[Category:Types of gates]]\n", "name_user": "2402:3a80:6d7:66c3:f170:851c:4aa5:fe41", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door"}
