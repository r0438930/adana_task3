In order to try and garner interest, he would later change the name to Capitol City as he had also dreamed of becoming the state's governor.\n\nLee built a beautiful home here with brick hauled from Pueblo at $1 per brick. It reportedly had a generous living room, theater with an orchestral pit and a few guest ballrooms. In addition to his house, he built the Henson Creek smelter and sawmill.
