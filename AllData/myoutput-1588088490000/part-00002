A Gujarati origin for scripts of [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]] and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a '''South Sulawesi script''', probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of [[Virama|vowel canceller marker]]s in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have [[virama|vowel canceller marker]]s, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines. It is a legal document with the inscribed date of Saka era 822, corresponding to April 21, 900 AD. It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].\n\n[[Image:Laguna Copperplate Inscription.gif|thumb|left| The Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nOne hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century.\n\n==History==\nThe best known evidence of where Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered. From these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:75%; margin:auto; line-height:1.25em;\"\n|+ Variants of Baybayin\n!Script\n!Region\n!Sample\n|-\n|[[Old Tagalog|Tagalog script]]\n|[[Tagalog people|Tagalog region]]\n|[[File:Sula_tagalo_babayi.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Sambal language|Sambal script]]\n|[[Zambales]]\n|[[File:scriptsambal.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Ilocano language|Kur-itan script]]\n|[[Ilocos]]\n|[[File:kurdita.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Kulitan alphabet|Kulitan script]]\n|[[Central Luzon]]\n|[[File:old_kulitan.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[:bcl: Iskriturang Basahan|Basahan script]]\n|[[Bicol Region]]\n|[[File:Surat Basahan.jpg|150px|Surat Basahan]]\n|-\n|[[Pangasinan language|Pangasinense script]]\n|[[Pangasinan]]\n|[[File: pangasinensescript.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Hanun\u00f3'o alphabet|Hanun\u00f3'o script]]\n|[[Mindoro]]\n|[[File:Hanunoo script sample.svg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Buhid script|Buhid script]]\n|[[Mindoro]]\n|[[File:Buhid script sample.svg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Tagbanwa script]]\n|Central and Northern [[Palawan]]\n|[[File:Tagbanwa script sample.svg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Palawan people#Language|Ibalnan script]]\n|[[Palawan]]\n|[[File:scriptofpalawano.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Visayan languages|Badlit script]]\n|[[Visayas]]\n|[[File:ayasib2.jpg|150px]]\n|}\n<br/>\nFrom what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s. So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]]. This theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n}} \n\nAccording to other sources, the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:DoctrinaChristianaEspanolaYTagala8-9.jpg|thumb|Pages of the ''Doctrina Christiana'', [[First book of the Spanish Philippines|an early Christian book]] in Spanish and Tagalog (1593)]]\n\nThe earliest printed book in a Philippine language, featuring both Tagalog in Baybayin and transliterated into Latin script, is the 1593 [[Doctrina Christiana|''Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espa\u00f1ola y Tagala'']]. The Tagalog text was based mainly on a manuscript written by [[Juan de Plasencia|Fr. Juan de Placencia]]. Friars Domingo de Nieva and Juan de San Pedro Martyr supervised the preparation and printing of the book, which was carried out by an unnamed Chinese artisan. This is the earliest example of Baybayin that exists today and it is the only example from the 1500s. There is also series of legal documents containing Baybayin, preserved in Spanish and Philippine archives that span more than a century: the three oldest, all in the Archivo General de \u00cdndias in Seville, are from 1591 and 1599. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Christopher |title=A survey of indigenous scripts of Indonesia and the Philippines |date=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/15915312/A_Survey_of_Indigenous_Scripts_of_Indonesia_and_the_Philippines}}</ref> <ref name=pmorrowchart/>\n\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\nIn 1620, Fr. Francisco Lopez wrote his ''Ilokano Doctrina'' based on the catechism written by Cardinal Belarmine. This is an important moment in the history of Baybayin, because the +-kudl\u00edt was introduced for the first time, which allowed for unvoiced consonants. He commented the following on his decision <ref name=\"baybayin\"/>:\n\n{{quote\n|text=The reason for putting the text of the Doctrina in Tagalog type... has been to begin the correction of the said Tagalog script, which, as it is, is so defective and confused (because of not having any method until now for expressing final consonants - I mean, those without vowels) that the most learned reader has to stop and ponder over many words to decide on the pronunciation which the writer intended.}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the [[Tagbanwa script|Palaw'an script]] inherited from the [[Tagbanwa]] in Palawan, the [[Buhid script|Buhid]] and [[Hanunuo script|Hanun\u00f3o]] scripts in [[Mindoro]]. The ancient [[Kulitan alphabet|Kapampangan script]] used in the 1600s has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\". There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system use in Baybayin is [[Abugida]] (alphasyllabary), that use consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels.

And the other one \" \u1734\" was introduced by Antoon Postma. \n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same symbol is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nA single character represented '''nga'''. The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n<br>\n<gallery>\nFile:Abakada_tagalog.png|thumb|350px|The [[Abakada alphabet|abakada]] in [[Old Tagalog|Tagalog script]]\nFile:ayasib2.jpg|thumb|300px|Various [[Bisayan languages|Badlit scripts]]\nFile:Kulitan.svg|thumb|110px|The word '''kulitan''' in [[Kulitan alphabet|Modern Kulitan]]\nFile:Buhid script sample.svg|thumb|300px|The Abakada alphabet|[[abakada]] in [[Buhid script]]\nFile:pay lantege.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Lantege''' a Tagbanwa and Palaw'an love song, written in [[Tagbanwa script]]\nFile:Mayadpagyabi.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Mayad pagyabi''' (Good morning), written in [[hanunuo script]] using ''b17'' and ''b17x'' method respectively.\n</gallery>\n\n==== Virama Kudlit====\nThe original writing method was particularly difficult for the Spanish priests who were translating books into the [[Philippine languages|vernaculars]], because originally Baybayin omitted the final consonant without a vowel. This could cause confusion for readers over which word or pronunciation a writer originally intended. Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound and which allowed a final consonant to be written. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. \n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n=== Punctuation and spacing===\nBaybayin writing makes use of only two punctuation marks (originally only one), the Philippine single ({{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}) punctuation, acting today as a comma or verse splitter in poetry, and the double punctuation ({{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}), acting today as a period or end of paragraph. These punctuation marks are similar to single and double [[danda]] signs in other Indic Abugidas and may be presented vertically like Indic dandas, or slanted like forward slashes. The signs are unified across Philippines scripts and were encoded by Unicode in the [[Hanunoo alphabet|Hanun\u00f3o script]] block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch17.pdf#G26723|title=Chapter 17: Indonesia and Oceania, Philippine Scripts|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=March 2020}}</ref> Space separation of words was historically not used as words were written in a continuous flow, but is common today.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n=== Collation ===\n* In the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', the letters of Baybayin were collated (without any connection with other similar script, except sorting vowels before consonants) as:\n*: '''A, U/O, I/E; Ha, Pa, Ka, Sa, La, Ta, Na, Ba, Ma, Ga, Da/Ra, Ya, NGa, Wa'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16119/16119-h/16119-h.htm#d0e129 |title=Doctrina Cristiana |website=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>\n* In Unicode the letters are collated in coherence with other Indic scripts, by phonetic proximity for consonnants:\n*: '''A, I/E, U/O; Ka, Ga, Nga; Ta, Da/Ra, Na; Pa, Ba, Ma; Ya, La, Wa, Sa, Ha'''.<ref name=\"UnicodeTagalog\">[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1700.pdf Unicode Baybayin Tagalog variant]</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Pre-colonial and colonial usage===\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Philippine passport (2016 edition) Baybayin.jpg|thumb|250px|Philippine passport (2016 edition) showing the Baybayin script]]\n\nA number of legislative bills have been proposed periodically aiming to promote the writing system, among them is the \"National Writing System Act\" (House Bill 1022<ref>{{cite web| url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB01022.pdf|title=House Bill 1022|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#House of Representatives|17th Philippine House of Representatives]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=4 July 2016}}</ref>/Senate Bill 433<ref>{{cite web| url=https://senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=17&q=SBN-433|title=Senate Bill 433|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#Senate|17th Philippine Senate]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=19 July 2016}}</ref>).

However this doesn't apply to modern kulitan script (popularized during the 1990s), but it applies to Old kulitan, documented around 1690s.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''baybay\u00edn'' means \"to write or to spell(syllabize)\" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].\n\n'''Baybayin''' refers to other indigenous writings in the Philippines that are Abugida, including [[Buhid alphabet|Buhid script]], [[Hanun\u00f3'o alphabet|Hanun\u00f3'o script]], [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa script (Apurahuano)]], [[Kulitan alphabet|Kulitan script]], [[Old Tagalog|Tagalog script]] and others.

A Gujarati origin for scripts of [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]] and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a '''South Sulawesi script''', probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of [[Virama|vowel canceller marker]]s in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have [[virama|vowel canceller marker]]s, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines. It is a legal document with the inscribed date of Saka era 822, corresponding to April 21, 900 AD. It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].\n\n[[Image:Laguna Copperplate Inscription.gif|thumb|left| The Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nOne hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century.\n\n==History==\nThe best known evidence of where Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered. From these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:75%; margin:auto; line-height:1.25em;\"\n|+ Variants of Baybayin\n!Script\n!Region\n!Sample\n|-\n|[[Old Tagalog|Tagalog script]]\n|[[Tagalog people|Tagalog region]]\n|[[File:Sula_tagalo_babayi.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Sambal language|Sambal script]]\n|[[Zambales]]\n|[[File:scriptsambal.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Ilocano language|Kur-itan script]]\n|[[Ilocos]]\n|[[File:kurdita.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Kulitan alphabet|Kulitan script]]\n|[[Central Luzon]]\n|[[File:old_kulitan.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[:bcl: Iskriturang Basahan|Basahan script]]\n|[[Bicol Region]]\n|[[File:Surat Basahan.jpg|150px|Surat Basahan]]\n|-\n|[[Pangasinan language|Pangasinense script]]\n|[[Pangasinan]]\n|[[File: pangasinensescript.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Hanun\u00f3'o alphabet|Hanun\u00f3'o script]]\n|[[Mindoro]]\n|[[File:Hanunoo script sample.svg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Buhid script|Buhid script]]\n|[[Mindoro]]\n|[[File:Buhid script sample.svg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Tagbanwa script]]\n|Central and Northern [[Palawan]]\n|[[File:Tagbanwa script sample.svg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Palawan people#Language|Ibalnan script]]\n|[[Palawan]]\n|[[File:scriptofpalawano.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[Visayan languages|Badlit script]]\n|[[Visayas]]\n|[[File:ayasib2.jpg|150px]]\n|}\n<br/>\nFrom what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s. So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]]. This theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n}} \n\nAccording to other sources, the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:DoctrinaChristianaEspanolaYTagala8-9.jpg|thumb|Pages of the ''Doctrina Christiana'', [[First book of the Spanish Philippines|an early Christian book]] in Spanish and Tagalog (1593)]]\n\nThe earliest printed book in a Philippine language, featuring both Tagalog in Baybayin and transliterated into Latin script, is the 1593 [[Doctrina Christiana|''Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espa\u00f1ola y Tagala'']]. The Tagalog text was based mainly on a manuscript written by [[Juan de Plasencia|Fr. Juan de Placencia]]. Friars Domingo de Nieva and Juan de San Pedro Martyr supervised the preparation and printing of the book, which was carried out by an unnamed Chinese artisan. This is the earliest example of Baybayin that exists today and it is the only example from the 1500s. There are is also series of legal documents containing Baybayin, preserved in Spanish and Philippine archives that span more than a century: the three oldest, all in the Archivo General de \u00cdndias in Seville, are from 1591 and 1599. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Christopher |title=A survey of indigenous scripts of Indonesia and the Philippines |date=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/15915312/A_Survey_of_Indigenous_Scripts_of_Indonesia_and_the_Philippines}}</ref> <ref name=pmorrowchart/>\n\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\nIn 1620, Fr. Francisco Lopez wrote his ''Ilokano Doctrina'' based on the catechism written by Cardinal Belarmine. This is an important moment in the history of Baybayin, because the +-kudl\u00edt was introduced for the first time, which allowed for unvoiced consonants. He commented the following on his decision <ref name=\"baybayin\"/>:\n\n{{quote\n|text=The reason for putting the text of the Doctrina in Tagalog type... has been to begin the correction of the said Tagalog script, which, as it is, is so defective and confused (because of not having any method until now for expressing final consonants - I mean, those without vowels) that the most learned reader has to stop and ponder over many words to decide on the pronunciation which the writer intended.}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the [[Tagbanwa script|Palaw'an script]] inherited from the [[Tagbanwa]] in Palawan, the [[Buhid script|Buhid]] and [[Hanunuo script|Hanun\u00f3o]] scripts in [[Mindoro]]. The ancient [[Kulitan alphabet|Kapampangan script]] used in the 1600s has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\". There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system use in Baybayin is [[Abugida]] (alphasyllabary), that use consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels.

And the other one \" \u1734\" was introduced by Antoon Postma. \n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same symbol is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nA single character represented '''nga'''. The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n<br>\n<gallery>\nFile:Abakada_tagalog.png|thumb|350px|The [[Abakada alphabet|abakada]] in [[Old Tagalog|Tagalog script]]\nFile:ayasib2.jpg|thumb|300px|Various [[Bisayan languages|Badlit scripts]]\nFile:Kulitan.svg|thumb|110px|The word '''kulitan''' in [[Kulitan alphabet|Modern Kulitan]]\nFile:Buhid script sample.svg|thumb|300px|The Abakada alphabet|[[abakada]] in [[Buhid script]]\nFile:pay lantege.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Lantege''' a Tagbanwa and Palaw'an love song, written in [[Tagbanwa script]]\nFile:Mayadpagyabi.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Mayad pagyabi''' (Good morning), written in [[hanunuo script]] using ''b17'' and ''b17x'' method respectively.\n</gallery>\n\n==== Virama Kudlit====\nThe original writing method was particularly difficult for the Spanish priests who were translating books into the [[Philippine languages|vernaculars]], because originally Baybayin omitted the final consonant without a vowel. This could cause confusion for readers over which word or pronunciation a writer originally intended. Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound and which allowed a final consonant to be written. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. \n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n=== Punctuation and spacing===\nBaybayin writing makes use of only two punctuation marks (originally only one), the Philippine single ({{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}) punctuation, acting today as a comma or verse splitter in poetry, and the double punctuation ({{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}), acting today as a period or end of paragraph. These punctuation marks are similar to single and double [[danda]] signs in other Indic Abugidas and may be presented vertically like Indic dandas, or slanted like forward slashes. The signs are unified across Philippines scripts and were encoded by Unicode in the [[Hanunoo alphabet|Hanun\u00f3o script]] block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch17.pdf#G26723|title=Chapter 17: Indonesia and Oceania, Philippine Scripts|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=March 2020}}</ref> Space separation of words was historically not used as words were written in a continuous flow, but is common today.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n=== Collation ===\n* In the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', the letters of Baybayin were collated (without any connection with other similar script, except sorting vowels before consonants) as:\n*: '''A, U/O, I/E; Ha, Pa, Ka, Sa, La, Ta, Na, Ba, Ma, Ga, Da/Ra, Ya, NGa, Wa'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16119/16119-h/16119-h.htm#d0e129 |title=Doctrina Cristiana |website=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>\n* In Unicode the letters are collated in coherence with other Indic scripts, by phonetic proximity for consonnants:\n*: '''A, I/E, U/O; Ka, Ga, Nga; Ta, Da/Ra, Na; Pa, Ba, Ma; Ya, La, Wa, Sa, Ha'''.<ref name=\"UnicodeTagalog\">[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1700.pdf Unicode Baybayin Tagalog variant]</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Pre-colonial and colonial usage===\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Philippine passport (2016 edition) Baybayin.jpg|thumb|250px|Philippine passport (2016 edition) showing the Baybayin script]]\n\nA number of legislative bills have been proposed periodically aiming to promote the writing system, among them is the \"National Writing System Act\" (House Bill 1022<ref>{{cite web| url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB01022.pdf|title=House Bill 1022|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#House of Representatives|17th Philippine House of Representatives]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=4 July 2016}}</ref>/Senate Bill 433<ref>{{cite web| url=https://senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=17&q=SBN-433|title=Senate Bill 433|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#Senate|17th Philippine Senate]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=19 July 2016}}</ref>).
