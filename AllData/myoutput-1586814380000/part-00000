It is spread by transfer from the oral/nasal secretions of an infected individual to the [[oral cavity]] of an uninfected individual. Once in the oral cavity, the virus invades, reproduces in, establishes its lytic phase in, and [[lysis]] (i.e. bursts open) [[epithelial]] cells that line the oral [[mucosa]] of the newly infected individual. The freed virus then invades [[na\u00efve B cell]]s located in [[submucosa]]l lymphoid tissue e.g. [[tonsils]] or [[adenoids]]. Here, it establishes either a lytic phase that allows it to infect other lymphoid cells or expresses genes that suppress the lytic cycle and impose one of four latency phases. Initially, the virus establishes '''latency III''' by expressing [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latency|''EBNA-1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, LP, LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''-2B'']] and [[Epstein-Barr virus#Protein/genes|BART]] genes; [[cell membrane|cell surface membrane]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latent antigens|''LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''3A'']] genes; and [[microRNA]]s encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-1'']] and [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-2'']] genes. The products of these genes immortalize, promote the growth and survival, and regulate the maturation of the infected B cell. However, products of some latency III genes (particularly the viral cell surface proteins) make the infected cell susceptible to attack by the host's immune system. The virus avoids this by limiting expression of its latency genes to ''EBNA-1, LMP-1, -2A, -2B'', some BARTs, and the two EBERs. This '''Latency II''' pattern of gene expression continues the infected cells' immortalization and proliferation, helps the cells escape the [[immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]], and forces them to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] (i.e. mature) into [[memory B cell]]s. EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency I''' state in its infected memory B cells by expressing only ''EBNA1'' and the two EBER genes. The products of the latter genes keep the virus in a mostly dormant state. Finally, EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency 0''' phase by expressing only EBER genes. In latency 0, EBV is in memory B cells as fully dormant, non-reproductive viruses but in this, as in all of the other latency phases, it can revert to its lytic phase.<ref name=\"pmid30125149\"/> The following table gives more information on the actions of the EBV latency genes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The lymphocytes are primarily B cells (e.g., express [[CD20]] and [[CD10]] markers) with rare T cells evident only in the background.<ref name=\"pmid22333947\"/> The B cells are derived mostly from germinal center B cells, contain EBV in latency I phase, and express high levels of EBNA1 and EBER viral products.

''MYC'' is a [[Oncogene#Protoo-oncogene|proto-oncogene]] (i.e. a cancer-causing gene if appropriately mutated or overexpressed) located on the long (\"q\") arm of human chromosome 8 at position 24 (i.e. at 8q24).

These translocations  bring ''MYC'' under the [[gene#Transcription|transcriptional]] control of these antibody-forming loci and thereby cause the ''MYC'' product, [[Myc]] to be overexpressed and continuously driving the infected cell to proliferate. Mutations in other genes of the infected cell may promote its malignancy, e.g. ~30% of BL cases harbor B cell ''P53'' gene mutations which may promote cell survival.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These althernate, potentially EBV-independent routes to malignancy and the fact that some BL cases do not involve EBV allow that many cases of EBV+ BL are not caused and/or promoted by EBV: the ubiquitous virus is the likely cause of almost all cases of eBL but be an innocent [[passenger virus]] in many cases of sBL and iBL.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nPatients with any of the three forms of BL (with or without an association with EBV) are treated with  multiple drug [[chemotherapy]] regimens. While past studies found much better results in children than adults using this approach, recent studies report that more aggressive chemotherapy regimens that include the [[intrathecal administration]] of drugs give better results. The COCOX-M-IVAC regimen (systemic [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]], [[doxorubicin]], and high-dose [[methotrexate]] alternating with [[ifosfamide]], [[etoposide]], and [[cytarabine]] plus intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine) give event-free 2 year response rates of >90% in both children and adults. Addition of [[rituximab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] against the CD20 antigen expressed on B cells, may be added to this or other multiple drug regimens. Autologous [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell bone marrow transplantation]] has not improved the results of these regiments. Treatment of HIV-associated iBL is similar to, and has success rates comparable, to non-HIV BL, particularly when coupled with treatment directed at HIV although adults >40 years old have had poorer responses to these regiments.

Thus, the relationship of EBV to the development and progression of PTCL, NOS is unclear.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nThere are no controlled studies on the treatment of this disease. Recommended treatments for advanced stage PTCL, NOS (regardless of EBV status) include intensive chemotherapy regimens, e.g. [[CHOP]], as [[Therapy#Lines of therapy|induction therapy]] possibly followed by [[autologous]] [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]]. These regimens have shown only limited results with 5 year overall survival rates <50% for chemotherapy alone. These survival rates may be improved in patients able to withstand follow-up bone marrow transplantation. Newer drug approaches using [[Pralatrexate]], [[Romidepsin]], [[Brentuximab vedotin]], [[Belinostat]], [[Bendamustine]], [[lenalidomide]], and [[alisertib]] have shown activity against CTCL, NOS and are being further studied in randomized trials for use in treating refractory and relapsed as well as initial disease.<ref name=\"pmid28115372\"/>\n\n==== Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma ====\n{{main|angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma}}\nAngioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (ATIL) is a systemic malignancy of mature [[follicular B helper T cells]] (T<sub>FH</sub> cells).<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> ATIL is often manifested soon after individuals ingest antibiotics or have an infection or allergic reaction. The disease presents with generalized swelling of lymph nodes, enlarged liver and spleen, skin lesions (rash, or, less commonly, nodules, plaques, [[purpura]], and [[urticarial]]),  bone marrow involvement, and [[B symptoms]] of fever, weight loss, and [[night sweats]]. Individuals may also present with [[arthralgias]], [[arthritis]], [[pleural effusion]]s, [[ascites]], lung lesions, and neurological and gastrointestinal disturbances. Laboratory tests commonly reveal the presence of [[hemolytic anemia#Extrinsic causes|immune-mediated hemolytic anemia]]; elevated blood levels of [[eosinophils]], [[gamma globulins]], and [[lactic dehydrogenase]]; high [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]s; and positive blood tests for [[autoantibodies]] such as [[rheumatoid factor]], [[anti-nuclear antibody]], and [[anti-smooth muscle antibody]]. Several of these clinical and laboratory features suggest that the afflicted individuals have an underlining abnormality in their [[immune system]]. Involved tissues exhibit vascular proliferation, small lymphoid cells clustered around [[venule]]s in a background containing T<sub>FH</sub> cells, activated lymphocytes, [[follicular dendritic cells]], [[epithelioid cell]]s, [[plasma cell]]s, and [[eosinophil]]s. Only the T<sub>FH</sub> cells are malignant. The latter cells represent 5\u201330% of all cells in the disease's lesions, express T<sub>FH</sub> cell marker proteins (e.g. [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]], [[CD4]], [[CD10]], [[programmed cell death protein 1]] (PD-1), and also express the B lymphocyte [[chemoattractant]], [[CXCL13|chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13]] (i.e. CXCL13).<ref name=\"pmid24468316\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mosalpuria K, Bociek RG, Vose JM | title = Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma management | journal = Seminars in Hematology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u20138 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24468316 | doi = 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2013.11.008 | url = }}</ref> Virtually all cases exhibit a scattering of EBV+ B cells with the virus possibly being in a restricted latency II phase.

It is due to the immunosuppressive drug regimens that accompany these transplantations. EBV-positivity occurs in 60\u201380% of these cases and, unlike EBV-negative cases, EBV+ cases develop more often within the first year after transplantation. The 2026 WHO classification divides these disorders into:<ref name=\"pmid28506687\"/>\n\n'''1)''' Non-destructive PTLD: this disorder is characterized by [[hyperplasia]] of [[plasma cell]]s, florid hyperplasia of [[lymph node]] follicles, and infectious mononucleosis. All three of these are non-malignant disorders that involve lesions admixed with non-destructive proliferations of plasma which are usually EBV-negative, EBV-negative B cells, and rare EBV-positive T cells.\n\n'''2)''' Monomorphic PTLD: this disorder is a B- or T cell lymphoms. It includes only aggressive lymphomas while excluding all indolent forms of LPD except for the inclusion of EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer The EBV+ positivity of cells involved in these PTLD are similar to those occurring in immune-competent individuals. In EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer, lesions commonly include EBV-positive plasma cells.\n\n'''3)''' Classic Hodgkin lymphoma: This HD malignancy is characterized by have EBV+ cells its lesions. These lesions are otherwise similar to those occurring in immune competent individuals.\n\nThe virus in the three PTLD are in latency phase III and express most if not all of their latency genes including, in particular, LMP1 and LMP2A.

FDCS is a rare malignancy of [[follicular dendritic cell]]s (FD cells). These [[myofibroblast]]-like cells are derived from the stroma (i.e. [[connective tissue]]) of [[Lymph node stromal cell|lymph nodes]] and other [[Lymphatic system#Lymphoid tissue|lympatic tissue]] and therefore are not lymphocytes. FD cells express several markers expressed by lymphocytes; occupy the [[germinal center]]s of lymphoid tissues; and attract, stimulate the differentiation and proliferation of, and [[antigen-presenting cell|present foreign antigens]] to B-cells.<ref name=\"pmid25310210\"/> The FD cells in FDCS may derive from [[follicular lymphoma]] cells by the process of [[transdifferentiation]].<ref name=\"pmid25310210\"/> FDCS affects primarily young to middle-aged adults of both sexes. Afflicted individuals commonly present with painless, slowly progressive swelling of cervical lymph nodes. About 33% of cases exhibit (with or without cervical lymph node swelling) tumors of skin, [[mediastinum]], tonsils, gastrointestinal tract, and/or soft tissues.

It is spread by transfer from the oral/nasal secretions of an infected individual to the [[oral cavity]] of an uninfected individual. Once in the oral cavity, the virus invades, reproduces in, establishes its lytic phas ine, and [[lysis]] (i.e. bursts open) [[epithelial]] cells that line the oral [[mucosa]] of the newly infected individual. The freed virus then invades [[na\u00efve B cell]]s located in [[submucosa]]l lymphoid tissue e.g. [[tonsils]] or [[adenoids]]. Here, it establishes either a lytic phase that allows it to infect other lymphoid cells or expresses genes that suppress the lytic cycle and impose one of four latency phases. Initially, the virus establishes '''latency III''' by expressing [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latency|''EBNA-1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, LP, LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''-2B'']] and [[Epstein-Barr virus#Protein/genes|BART]] genes; [[cell membrane|cell surface membrane]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latent antigens|''LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''3A'']] genes; and [[microRNA]]s encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-1'']] and [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-2'']] genes. The products of these genes immortalize, promote the growth and survival, and regulate the maturation of the infected B cell. However, products of some latency III genes (particularly the viral cell surface proteins) make the infected cell susceptible to attack by the host's immune system. The virus avoids this by limiting expression of its latency genes to ''EBNA-1, LMP-1, -2A, -2B'', some BARTs, and the two EBERs. This '''Latency II''' pattern of gene expression continues the infected cells' immortalization and proliferation, helps the cells escape the [[immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]], and forces them to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] (i.e. mature) into [[memory B cell]]s. EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency I''' state in its infected memory B cells by expressing only ''EBNA1'' and the two EBER genes. The products of the latter genes keep the virus in a mostly dormant state. Finally, EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency 0''' phase by expressing only EBER genes.

The lesions occur primarily on the sun-exposed skin of the face and back of the hand. It is an EBV+ disorder in which most cases develop in children, follow a waxing and waning course, and resolve in early adulthood. However, the disorder can occur in adults. Furthermore, the disease in children or adults may progress to cause severe, extensive, and disfiguring skin lesions unrelated to sunlight exposure, facial edema, and systemic manifestations such as fever, weight loss, and enlargements of lymph nodes, liver, and/or spleen. These cases may progress to an EBV+ LPD such as [[T cell lymphoma]], [[T cell leukemia]], [[B cell lymphoma]], or [[B cell leukemia]].<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> The milder and more aggressive forms of hydroa vacciniforme were initially termed classic hydroa vacciniforme and hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma, respectively, but extensive overlap between the two disease types lead the 2016 [[World Health Organization]] to reclassify them into a single disorder termed Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoproliferative disease and to be a subcategory of CAEBV.

It is thought that the reduce efficacy of [[Immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]] associated with these predisposing conditions or treatments maintain EBV in a dormant state systemically but not where EBV+ B cells are prevalent, i.e. in afflicted mucous membranes and skin. Consequently, the EBV+ cells at these sites proliferate and destroy tissue to create ulcerating lesions.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\" />\n\nPersons developing these ulcers are usually elderly. Their ulcers are typically isolated, occur in the oral [[mucosa]] and less commonly in skin or [[gastrointestinal tract]] mucosa. Besides pain at the ulcer site and local tissue destruction (which may be severe), individuals with EBV+ mucocutaneous ulcer are symptomless and lack [[lymphadenopathy]] (i.e. enlarged and painful lymph nodes), involvement in other tissues, or B symptoms. However, ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract may present with a variety of abdominal symptoms including acute emergency perforations. Unlike most other forms of EBV+LPD, EBV-associated mucocutantious ulcers are generally not associated with detectable blood levels of EBV.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> Microscopically, the ulcers consist of lymphocytes, including EBV+ B cells, sometimes a scattering of other EBV+ lymphoid cell types, and [[histiocyte]]s, [[plasma cells]], [[eosinophils]], and scattered large [[immunoblast]]s which may closely resemble but are not the [[Reed\u2013Sternberg cell]]s seen in Hodgkin lymphoma.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These Reed-Sternberg\u2013like cells are EBV+ B cells that express the [[tumor marker]] cell surface membrane protein, [[CD30]], the B cell surface membrane marker, [[CD20]],<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> and the proteins typical of the EBV replication cycle latency II or III phase.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nIn elderly individuals with no other cause for immunosuppression, EBV+ mucocutaneous disease may exhibit a relapsing and remitting course with their ulcers worsening but then regressing spontaneously.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> Persistent and/or severely symptomatic cases have had excellent responses to [[rituximab]], a commercial [[monoclonal antibody]] directed against the CD20 protein present on B cells.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> Individuals developing these ulcers as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy for other diseases generally have a remission after the dosages of the drugs used in their immunosuppressive treatment regimens are reduced. Most of these patients do not experience a relapse.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/>\n\n== EBV+ B cell lymphoproliferative diseases ==\nAfter its initial entry into B cells, the Epstein\u2013Barr virus infects other B cells and in doing so may or may not cause a symptomatic disease viz., infectious mononucleosis. In either case, the virus soon switches to its dormant, [[Virus latency|viral latency 0]] phase within [[memory B cell]]s and the infected individual becomes an asymptomatic, lifelong EBV carrier.

The lymphocytes are primarily B cells (e.g., express [[CD20]] and [[CD10]] markers) with rare T cells evident only in the background.<ref name=\"pmid22333947\"/> The B cells are derived mostly from germinal center B cells, contain EBV in latency I phase, and express high levels of EBNA1 and EBER viral products.

''MYC'' is a [[Oncogene#Protoo-oncogene|proto-oncogene]] (i.e. a cancer-causing gene if appropriately mutated or overexpressed) located on the long (\"q\") arm of human chromosome 8 at position 24 (i.e. at 8q24). In ~90% of BL cases, ''MYC'' is [[Chromosomal translocation|translocated]] to the ''[[IGH@|IGH]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain]]) gene locus at position 14q32, the ''[[IGK@|IGK]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin kappa light chain]]) gene at position 2p12 (\"p\" stands for short chromosome arm), or the ''[[IGL@|IGL]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin lambda light chain]]) gene at position 22q11. These translocations  bring ''MYC'' under the [[gene#Transcription|transcriptional]] control of these antibody-forming loci and thereby cause the ''MYC'' product, [[Myc]] to be overexpressed and continuously driving the infected cell to proliferate. Mutations in other genes of the infected cell may promote its malignancy, e.g. ~30% of BL cases harbor B cell ''P53'' gene mutations which may promote cell survival.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These althernate, potentially EBV-independent routes to malignancy and the fact that some BL cases do not involve EBV allow that many cases of EBV+ BL are not caused and/or promoted by EBV: the ubiquitous virus is the likely cause of almost all cases of eBL but be an innocent [[passenger virus]] in many cases of sBL and iBL.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nPatients with any of the three forms of BL (with or without an association with EBV) are treated with  multiple drug [[chemotherapy]] regimens. While past studies found much better results in children than adults using this approach, recent studies report that more aggressive chemotherapy regimens that include the [[intrathecal administration]] of drugs give better results. The COCOX-M-IVAC regimen (systemic [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]], [[doxorubicin]], and high-dose [[methotrexate]] alternating with [[ifosfamide]], [[etoposide]], and [[cytarabine]] plus intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine) give event-free 2 year response rates of >90% in both children and adults. Addition of [[rituximab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] against the CD20 antigen expressed on B cells, may be added to this or other multiple drug regimens. Autologous [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell bone marrow transplantation]] has not improved the results of these regiments. Treatment of HIV-associated iBL is similar to, and has success rates comparable, to non-HIV BL, particularly when coupled with treatment directed at HIV although adults >40 years old have had poorer responses to these regiments.

This gene product protein, LMP1, mimics activated human [[TNF receptor superfamily|TNF receptors]] (e.g. [[CD40]], [[CD40]], and [[RANK]]) in continuously stimulating the [[NF-\u03baB]], [[PI3K]] and [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway]]s which promote cell proliferation, survival, and production of [[cytokines]] that may suppress the EBV's lytic cycle to maintain the HRS cells viability.<ref name=\"pmid28893938\"/> HRS cells also express the virus's LMP2A gene protein product which mimics the human [[BCR (gene)|BCR gene]] product) in promoting the survival of its parent cells.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> And, EBV, by undefined mechanisms, causes ''crippling'' mutations in the HRS cell's [[V(D)J recombination|rearranged immunoglobulin G genes]] to prevent them from expressing immunoglobulins and inducing them to secrete cytokines which recruit the other cited cell types into the EBV+HL's pathological infiltrates. This helps create a local environment conducive for HRS cells to evade the immune system and proliferate.<ref name=\"pmid28893938\"/>\n\nEBV+ HL is more prevalent in young children and young adults but can occur in those over 80 years old, perhaps because of [[Immunosenescence|old age-related]] deterioration in immune system function, infectious diseases, or malnutrition.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> The incidence of EBV+ HD's in individuals with [[HIV/AIDS]] is also high, ~10-fold greater than the general population, but the causes for this is unclear.<ref name=\"pmid28893938\"/> The presentation of EBV+ HL is similar to that of EBV-HL, e.g. fever, night sweats, weight loss in the setting of swollen lymph nodes, and/or evidence of tumor invasion of other tissues.

EBV+ DLBCL is distinguished from DLBCL (often termed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, i.e. DLBCL, NOS) in that virtually all the large B cells in the tissue infiltrates of the EBV+ disease type express EBV genes characteristic of the virus's latency III (common in the elderly) or II (common in younger patients) phase.<ref name=\"pmid25294567\"/> These large B cells in EBV+ DLBCL are [[centroblast]]ic (i.e. activated) B-cells<ref name=\"pmid30125149\"/> that express EBERs,<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> LMP1, EBNA1, EBNA2, and other viral proteins;<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> in >50% of cases, they also express classic B cell antigenic proteins such as [[CD20]], [[BCL6]], and [[CD15]].

Signs and symptoms of DLBCL-CI reflect the destructive effects of the malignancy in the afflicted areas. The infiltrative lesions consist of diffuse large EBV+ B cells in latency III amidst a variety of benign, EBV-negative chronic inflammatory [[white blood cells]]. The EBV+ large B cells in these lesions often have reduced expression of the CD20 antigen and contain genetic abnormalities such as mutations in ''[[P53]]'', overexpression of ''[[Myc]]'', and deletion of ''[[TNFAIP3]]''.

Afflicted individuals commonly present with painless, slowly progressive swelling of cervical lymph nodes. About 33% of cases exhibit (with or without cervical lymph node swelling) tumors of skin, [[mediastinum]], tonsils, gastrointestinal tract, and/or soft tissues.
