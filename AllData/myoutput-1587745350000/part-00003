Le\u015bnica (now part of Wroc\u0142aw), 7 or 8 December 1201) was [[Duke]] of [[Wroclaw]] from 1163 until his death in 1201.\n\nHe was the eldest son of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]] by his wife [[Agnes of Babenberg]], daughter of Margrave [[Leopold III, Margrave of Austria|Leopold III of Austria]] and half-sister of King [[Conrad III of Germany]].\n\n==Life==\n\n=== Early Years ===\nBoles\u0142aw spent his childhood in the court of his grandfather and namesake, [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]], in [[P\u0142ock]]. It was not until 1138, after the death of Boles\u0142aw III, that he moved with his parents to [[Krak\u00f3w]], which became the capital of the [[Seniorate Province]], ruled by his father as High Duke and overlord of Poland.\n\nThe reign of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II was short and extremely stormy. The conflicts began when the High Duke tried to remove his half-brothers, the Junior Dukes, from their districts. According to the chronicler [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]], the confrontation between the siblings was mainly instigated by W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's wife, Agnes of Babenberg, who believed that her husband, as the eldest son, was the rightful sole ruler of the whole country. On the other hand, [[Salomea of Berg]], widow of Boles\u0142aw III and W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's stepmother, attempted to form alliances with foreign rulers and took every opportunity to secure the reign of her sons, the Junior Dukes. She feared that they would be relegated from their positions to make way for W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's sons, the young Boles\u0142aw and his brothers [[Mieszko I Tanglefoot|Mieszko Tanglefoot]] and [[Konrad Spindleshanks|Konrad]].\n\nThe conflict erupted in 1141, when Salomea of Berg, without the knowledge of the High Duke, decided to leave her sons the land of [[\u0141\u0119czyca]], her [[dower]] (pl: ''oprawa wdowia'') and tried to give her youngest daughter Agnes in marriage to one of the sons of [[Vsevolod II Olgovich]], Grand Prince of [[Kiev]]. W\u0142adys\u0142aw II was faster, however, and he gave Grand Prince Vsevolod II several additional political advantages, including a marriage between Boles\u0142aw and Vsevolod II's daughter, [[Zvenislava of Kiev|Zvenislava]], which took place in 1142.\n\n===Trip to Ruthenia===\n[[Image:Boles\u0142aw I Wysoki.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Boles\u0142aw I the Tall in a drawing by [[Jan Matejko]].]]\nThe Polish-Ruthenian alliance soon proved to be extremely important in the struggle between W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and the Junior Dukes. The final conflicts took place after the death of Salomea of Berg in 1144. It seemed that a victory for the High Duke - thanks to his military predominance - was just a matter of time. In fact, W\u0142adys\u0142aw II was so confident of winning at home that he sent Boles\u0142aw to aid Grand Prince Vsevolod II during a revolt in Kiev.\n\nUnfortunately, Boles\u0142aw's expedition ended in complete disaster, as the Grand Prince's death from disease created general confusion in Kiev. Then in 1146, Boles\u0142aw had to return quickly to Poland to help his father. The few troops which he recruited were not enough to stop the general rebellion against W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, who was completely defeated by the Junior Dukes. The deposed High Duke and his family initially escaped to the [[Prague]] court of Duke [[Vladislaus II, Duke and King of Bohemia|Vladislav II of Bohemia]].\n\n===Unsuccessful attempt at restoration===\nAfter a short time in Bohemia, W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and his family moved to Germany, where King [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] (half-brother of his wife Agnes) offered his hospitality and assistance toward the High Duke's restoration. At first, it seemed that the exile would just be for a few months, thanks to the family connections of Duchess Agnes; however, their hurried and insufficiently prepared expedition failed to cross the [[Oder River]], and ultimately failed because of strong opposition from W\u0142adys\u0142aw II's former subjects and problems Conrad III had within Germany as a result of his extended travels. The King gave W\u0142adys\u0142aw II and his family the town of [[Altenburg]] in [[Saxony]]. This was intended as a temporary residence, but W\u0142adys\u0142aw II would spend the rest of his life there.\n\n===Knight at the court of Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa===\nTired of a tedious life in Altenburg, Boles\u0142aw traveled to the court of his protector, King Conrad III. With him, the young Polish prince extensively took part in German political affairs. In 1148 he joined in the [[Second Crusade]] with Conrad III, during which he visited [[Constantinople]] and the [[Holy Land]].\n\nConrad III died in 1152 without having secured the return of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II to Poland. His successor was his energetic nephew [[Frederick Barbarossa]], whose service Boles\u0142aw almost immediately joined. The first action of the new German ruler, however, was not to help W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, but instead to march against Rome and be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Boles\u0142aw accompanied him.\n\n===Expedition of Frederick Barbarossa to Poland===\nIt was not until 1157 that the Emperor finally organized an expedition against Poland. It is unknown whether Boles\u0142aw, his brothers, or his father directly participated in the expedition. However, despite the military victory and the humiliating submission of High Duke [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]] to Frederick Barbarossa, the Emperor decided to maintain the rule of Boles\u0142aw IV and the Junior Dukes in Poland, and not to restore W\u0142adys\u0142aw II to the throne. Two years later, on 30 May 1159, the disappointed former High Duke died in his exile in Altenburg.\n\n===Restoration of the Silesian Inheritance===\n[[Image:POL wojew\u00f3dztwo dolno\u015bl\u0105skie COA.svg|thumb|left|150px|The black crownless eagle of the [[Silesian Piasts]].]]\nDespite his dissatisfaction at the Emperor's treatment of his father, Boles\u0142aw remained at the side of the Emperor, participating in his many wars. From 1158-1162 he took part in the Barbarossa's expedition to Italy, where he won fame after killing a well-known Italian knight in a duel on the walls of [[Milan]].\n\nBoles\u0142aw's faithful service to the Emperor was finally rewarded in 1163, when Barbarossa succeeded through diplomacy in restoring to the descendants of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II their inheritance over [[Silesia]]. By an agreement signed in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, Boles\u0142aw IV agreed to accept the return of the exiled princes. He did so because, after the death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II, his sons could not directly challenge his authority as the senior duke, and they had not yet established any support within Poland. In addition, seating them would satisfy \nBarbarossa and thus keep him away from Poland.<ref name=\"Kalendarium Historii Polski\">{{cite book | author = [[Andrzej Chwalba]] | editor = Wydawnictwo Literackie| title = Kalendarium Historii Polski| url = | format = | year = 2000 | publisher =  | location = Krak\u00f3w  | isbn = 83-08-03136-6 | pages = :51\u201352| chapter = | chapterurl = | quote =|language=pl}}</ref> However Boles\u0142aw IV decided to maintain the security of his lands and retain the control over the main Silesian cities of [[Wroclaw]], [[Opole]], [[Racib\u00f3rz]], [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]], and [[Legnica]].\n\nAfter almost 16 years of exile, Boles\u0142aw returned to Silesia with his second wife, Christina (Zvenislava had died around 1155); his elder children, [[Jaros\u0142aw, Duke of Opole|Jaros\u0142aw]] and Olga; and his younger brother [[Mieszko I Tanglefoot|Mieszko Tanglefoot]]. The youngest brother, [[Konrad Spindleshanks|Konrad]], remained in Germany.\n\nBoles\u0142aw and Mieszko initially ruled jointly and two years later (1165) both retook the major Silesian cities handed back by the High Duke and obtained full control over all Silesia. However Boles\u0142aw, as the eldest brother, held overall authority. Three years after taking control over Silesia, Boles\u0142aw felt strong enough to lead a retaliatory expedition against the High Duke Boles\u0142aw IV to try and recover supremacy over Poland.\n\n===Rebellion of Mieszko Tanglefoot===\n[[Image:Silesia 1172-1177.jpg|thumb|right|200pz|Fragmentation of the Duchy of Silesia begins. Period 1172/3-1177<br/>{{legend|orange|Boles\u0142aw I the Tall}}<br/>{{legend|green|Jaros\u0142aw Opolski}}<br/>{{legend|yellow|Mieszko I Tanglefoot}}]]\nBoles\u0142aw's exercise of overall power at the expense of his younger brother caused a revolt by Mieszko Tanglefoot in 1172. In a major disturbance in the Silesian ducal family, Mieszko supported Jaros\u0142aw, the eldest son of Boles\u0142aw, who was resentful against his father because had been forced to become a priest due to the intrigues of his stepmother Christina, who wished for her sons to be the only heirs. The rebellion was a complete surprise to Boles\u0142aw, who was forced to escape to [[Erfurt]], Germany. This time, Frederick Barbarossa decided to support Boles\u0142aw with a strong armed intervention to restore him to his Duchy. Eventually Mieszko III the Old was sent by the High Duke to calm the fury of the Emperor and keep him away from Polish affairs. Mieszko III gave Barbarossa 8000 pieces of silver and promised him the restoration of Boles\u0142aw, who finally returned home at the beginning of 1173. However, despite his reconciliation with his brother and son, he was forced to divide Silesia and create the Duchies of Racib\u00f3rz (granted to Mieszko) and Opole (to Jaros\u0142aw).\n\n===Rebellion against Mieszko III the Old===\nFour years later, it seemed that Boles\u0142aw was close to achieving the main objective of his life, the recovery of the Seniorate Province, and with this the title of High Duke. He conspired with his uncle [[Casimir II the Just]] and his cousin [[Odon of Greater Poland|Odon]] (Mieszko III's eldest son) to deprive [[Mieszko III the Old]] of the government. The coup gained the support of [[Lesser Poland]], which was mastered{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} by Casimir and shortly afterwards [[Greater Poland]] sided with Odon.  Boles\u0142aw, however, suffered a sudden and surprising defeat at the hands of his brother Mieszko and his son Jaros\u0142aw who had allied with Mieszko III. This left the way free for Casimir II to be proclaimed High Duke, and Boles\u0142aw again had to escape to Germany. Thanks to the mediation of Casimir II, Boles\u0142aw returned to his Duchy without major troubles in 1177; however, he suffered a further diminution of his authority when he was compelled to give G\u0142og\u00f3w to his youngest brother Konrad.\n\n===Retirement from political affairs===\nAfter this defeat, Boles\u0142aw retired from the Polish political scene and concentrated his efforts on the rule over his duchy. His brother Konrad's death without issue in 1190 resulted in the return of G\u0142og\u00f3w to his domains.\n\nDuring the last years of his reign, Boles\u0142aw devoted himself to economic and business activity. Colonization, initially from poor German areas, substantially accelerated the economic development of the duchy, and was continued by his son [[Henry I the Bearded]]. Boles\u0142aw founded the Cistercian [[Abbatia Lubensis abbey]] in [[Lubi\u0105\u017c]] with the collaboration of monks from [[Pforta]], across the [[Saale River]] in [[Thuringia]]. Later the abbey became the Silesian ducal burial place.\n\n===Papal bull and death===\nTo safeguard his lands from other [[Piast]] princes, Boles\u0142aw obtained a protective [[Papal bull|bull]] from [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1198. There was a reconciliation between Boles\u0142aw and his eldest son, Jaros\u0142aw, who was elected [[List of bishops of Wroc\u0142aw|Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]. This enabled him, after Jaros\u0142aw's death on 22 March 1201, to inherit Opole, which was again reunited with his lands.\n\nBoles\u0142aw survived his son by only nine months, however, and died on 7 or 8 December 1201 in his {{ill|castle in Le\u015bnica|pl|Zamek w Le\u015bnicy}}, west of Wroc\u0142aw. He was buried in the [[Lubi\u0105\u017c]] Cistercian [[Abbatia Lubensis abbey|monastery]] which he had founded.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nIn 1142 Boles\u0142aw married his first wife [[Zvenislava of Kiev|Zvenislava]] (d. ca. 1155), daughter of [[Vsevolod II Olgovich]], Grand Prince of [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Raffensperger|2018|p=114}} They had two children:\n#[[Jaros\u0142aw, Duke of Opole|Jaros\u0142aw]] (b. aft. 1143 \u2013 d. 22 March 1201)\n#Olga (b. ca. 1155 \u2013 d. 27 June 1175/1180)\n\nBy 1157, Boles\u0142aw married his second wife Christina (d. 21 February 1204/1208), a German; according to the historian [[Kazimierz Jasi\u0144ski]], she was probably a member of the [[comital]] house of [[Everstein]], [[House of Homburg|Homburg]], or [[Pappenheim]].

In addition, seating them would satisfy \nBarbarossa and thus keep him away from Poland.<ref name=\"Kalendarium Historii Polski\">{{cite book | author = [[Andrzej Chwalba]] | editor = Wydawnictwo Literackie| title = Kalendarium Historii Polski| url = | format = | year = 2000 | publisher =  | location = Krak\u00f3w  | isbn = 83-08-03136-6 | pages = :51\u201352| chapter = | chapterurl = | quote =|language=pl}}</ref> However Boles\u0142aw IV decided to maintain the security of his lands and retain the control over the main Silesian cities of [[Wroclaw]], [[Opole]], [[Racib\u00f3rz]], [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]], and [[Legnica]].\n\nAfter almost 16 years of exile, Boles\u0142aw returned to Silesia with his second wife, Christina (Zvenislava had died around 1155); his elder children, [[Jaros\u0142aw, Duke of Opole|Jaros\u0142aw]] and Olga; and his younger brother [[Mieszko I Tanglefoot|Mieszko Tanglefoot]]. The youngest brother, [[Konrad Spindleshanks|Konrad]], remained in Germany.\n\nBoles\u0142aw and Mieszko initially ruled jointly and two years later (1165) both retook the major Silesian cities handed back by the High Duke and obtained full control over all Silesia. However Boles\u0142aw, as the eldest brother, held overall authority. Three years after taking control over Silesia, Boles\u0142aw felt strong enough to lead a retaliatory expedition against the High Duke Boles\u0142aw IV to try and recover supremacy over Poland.\n\n===Rebellion of Mieszko Tanglefoot===\n[[Image:Silesia 1172-1177.jpg|thumb|right|200pz|Fragmentation of the Duchy of Silesia begins. Period 1172/3-1177<br/>{{legend|orange|Boles\u0142aw I the Tall}}<br/>{{legend|green|Jaros\u0142aw Opolski}}<br/>{{legend|yellow|Mieszko I Tanglefoot}}]]\nBoles\u0142aw's exercise of overall power at the expense of his younger brother caused a revolt by Mieszko Tanglefoot in 1172. In a major disturbance in the Silesian ducal family, Mieszko supported Jaros\u0142aw, the eldest son of Boles\u0142aw, who was resentful against his father because had been forced to become a priest due to the intrigues of his stepmother Christina, who wished for her sons to be the only heirs. The rebellion was a complete surprise to Boles\u0142aw, who was forced to escape to [[Erfurt]], Germany. This time, Frederick Barbarossa decided to support Boles\u0142aw with a strong armed intervention to restore him to his Duchy. Eventually Mieszko III the Old was sent by the High Duke to calm the fury of the Emperor and keep him away from Polish affairs. Mieszko III gave Barbarossa 8000 pieces of silver and promised him the restoration of Boles\u0142aw, who finally returned home at the beginning of 1173. However, despite his reconciliation with his brother and son, he was forced to divide Silesia and create the Duchies of Racib\u00f3rz (granted to Mieszko) and Opole (to Jaros\u0142aw).\n\n===Rebellion against Mieszko III the Old===\nFour years later, it seemed that Boles\u0142aw was close to achieving the main objective of his life, the recovery of the Seniorate Province, and with this the title of High Duke. He conspired with his uncle [[Casimir II the Just]] and his cousin [[Odon of Greater Poland|Odon]] (Mieszko III's eldest son) to deprive [[Mieszko III the Old]] of the government. The coup gained the support of [[Lesser Poland]], which was mastered{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} by Casimir and shortly afterwards [[Greater Poland]] sided with Odon.  Boles\u0142aw, however, suffered a sudden and surprising defeat at the hands of his brother Mieszko and his son Jaros\u0142aw who had allied with Mieszko III. This left the way free for Casimir II to be proclaimed High Duke, and Boles\u0142aw again had to escape to Germany. Thanks to the mediation of Casimir II, Boles\u0142aw returned to his Duchy without major troubles in 1177; however, he suffered a further diminution of his authority when he was compelled to give G\u0142og\u00f3w to his youngest brother Konrad.\n\n===Retirement from political affairs===\nAfter this defeat, Boles\u0142aw retired from the Polish political scene and concentrated his efforts on the rule over his duchy. His brother Konrad's death without issue in 1190 resulted in the return of G\u0142og\u00f3w to his domains.\n\nDuring the last years of his reign, Boles\u0142aw devoted himself to economic and business activity. Colonization, initially from poor German areas, substantially accelerated the economic development of the duchy, and was continued by his son [[Henry I the Bearded]]. Boles\u0142aw founded the Cistercian [[Abbatia Lubensis abbey]] in [[Lubi\u0105\u017c]] with the collaboration of monks from [[Pforta]], across the [[Saale River]] in [[Thuringia]]. Later the abbey became the Silesian ducal burial place.\n\n===Papal bull and death===\nTo safeguard his lands from other [[Piast]] princes, Boles\u0142aw obtained a protective [[Papal bull|bull]] from [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1198. There was a reconciliation between Boles\u0142aw and his eldest son, Jaros\u0142aw, who was elected [[List of bishops of Wroc\u0142aw|Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]. This enabled him, after Jaros\u0142aw's death on 22 March 1201, to inherit Opole, which was again reunited with his lands.\n\nBoles\u0142aw survived his son by only nine months, however, and died on 7 or 8 December 1201 in his {{ill|castle in Le\u015bnica|pl|Zamek w Le\u015bnicy}}, west of Wroc\u0142aw. He was buried in the [[Lubi\u0105\u017c]] Cistercian [[Abbatia Lubensis abbey|monastery]] which he had founded.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nIn 1142 Boles\u0142aw married his first wife [[Zvenislava of Kiev|Zvenislava]] (d. ca. 1155), daughter of [[Vsevolod II Olgovich]], Grand Prince of [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Raffensperger|2018|p=114}} They had two children:\n#[[Jaros\u0142aw, Duke of Opole|Jaros\u0142aw]] (b. aft. 1143 \u2013 d. 22 March 1201)\n#Olga (b. ca. 1155 \u2013 d. 27 June 1175/1180)\n\nBy 1157, Boles\u0142aw married his second wife Christina (d. 21 February 1204/1208), a German; according to the historian [[Kazimierz Jasi\u0144ski]], she was probably a member of the [[comital]] house of [[Everstein]], [[House of Homburg|Homburg]], or [[Pappenheim]]. They had seven children:{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n#Boleslaw (b. 1157/63 \u2013 d. 18 July 1175/1181)\n#Adelaida Zbyslava (b. aft. 1165 \u2013 d. 29 March aft. 1213), married in 1177/82 to [[D\u011bpolt III]], a [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] prince\n#Konrad (b. 1158/68 \u2013 d. 5 July 1175/1190)\n#Jan (b. 1161/69 \u2013 d. bef. 10 March 1174)\n#Berta (b. ca 1167 \u2013 d. 7 May aft. 1200?)\n#[[Henry I the Bearded]] (b. 1165/70 \u2013 d.

According to some German historians<ref>[http://slaskwroclaw.info/indexe.php Silesian duchies: www.slaskwroclaw.info] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101155558/http://slaskwroclaw.info/indexe.php |date=1 January 2009 }}</ref> the date of 1163, when Boles\u0142aw and his brothers were allowed to return to Silesia, is considered to be the moment when Silesia separated from Poland and became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nOn the other hand, Polish historians claim that [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile]]'s sons, who were allowed to return by [[High Duke of Poland|High Duke]] Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly, were simply typical Piast dukes who ruled in the divided [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]].<ref>[http://www.wroclaw.pl/m6852/ Official site of the city of Wroc\u0142aw]</ref> (see more in [[Silesian Piasts#Silesian Piasts and Poland|Differing views of the Silesian Piasts]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Piast Dynasty]]\n* [[Silesian Piasts]]\n* [[Dukes of Silesia]]\n* [[History of Silesia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |title=Conflict, Bargaining, and Kinship Networks in Medieval Eastern Europe |first=Christian |last=Raffensperger |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishing |year=2018 |ref=harv}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[House of Piast]]||1127|8 December|1201}}\n|-\n| width=\"30%\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"| Preceded by<br>new creation<br>'''[[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]] as King of Poland'''\n| width=\"40%\" align=\"center\" | '''[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Wroclaw]]'''<br> '''''with Mieszko I Tanglefoot until 1173'''''<br> 1163\u20131201\n| width=\"30%\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\" | Succeeded by<br>'''[[Henry I the Bearded]]'''\n|-\n| width=\"30%\" align=\"center\" | Preceded by<br>'''[[Konrad Spindleshanks]]'''\n| width=\"40%\" align=\"center\" | '''[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of G\u0142og\u00f3w]]'''<br> 1190\u20131201\n|-\n| width=\"30%\" align=\"center\" | Preceded by<br>'''[[Jaros\u0142aw, Duke of Opole|Jaros\u0142aw]]'''\n| width=\"40%\" align=\"center\" | '''[[Duke of Opole]]'''<br>1201\n|-\n{{s-end}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boleslaw 01 the Tall}}\n[[Category:1127 births]]\n[[Category:1201 deaths]]\n[[Category:Medieval nobility of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:12th-century Polish people]]\n[[Category:13th-century Polish people]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Opole]]\n[[Category:People of Byzantine descent]]\n", "name_user": "ArisMethymna", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_I_the_Tall"}
