Chinese Expeditionary Force commander Wei Lihuang also played a fundamental role in striking the Imperial Japanese Army. Sun li-Jen, as the second commander of the new Chinese 1st Army,  one of the best of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. The 1st Army has since changed their equipment from old, unsuitable-for-combat caps into US-supplied M1 helmets, and had exchanged their bolt-action Type Zhongzheng rifles for newer American and British weaponry. In addition to that, the Chinese Expeditionary Force (CEF) had finally received artillery and air support from the US and British forces as well, giving them a distinct advantage against the now-malnourished, low-morale Japanese forces around Myitkyina. The US and British played a relatively minor role during the battle, although they also had combat units, such as the famed 'Merrill's Marauders', active in the fighting.\n\n==Siege==\nStilwell gave the Chinese 22nd Division orders to advance against the bridges held by the Japanese on March 15. After two months of fighting, Myitkyina was now in reach. With the arrival of the rainy season, the incessant rain didn't stop until May 17. On that day, at 10:00&nbsp;p.m., the Chinese Expeditionary Force launched an attack with the U.S. Army's 'Merrill's Marauders' unit against the Japanese airstrip at Myitkyina, supported by artillery. Eight Japanese planes were quickly destroyed as the battle escalated. The Japanese were caught by surprise, and, not knowing where their enemies were, poured gasoline onto the airfield in an attempt to disable it and retreated into Myitkyina proper, intending to fight the Chinese and Americans on more favorable terms there. The Chinese and the Americans quickly overran the field relatively intact, whereupon U.S. Army Air Forces  and Royal Air Force C-47 transport aircraft moved the Chinese 89th Regiment of the 30th Division to the battlefield to supplement the exhausted C.E.F. and Marauder units already at Myitkyina.\n\nAfterward, some Chinese units attacked the town itself, but the attack was soon called off when two Chinese battalions, in the confusion and excitement of the battle, mistakenly engaged each other in a fierce firefight, and when two other battalions were moved in, they too repeated the mistake.\n\nA stalemate ensued throughout June, but the [[Battle of Mogaung|capture of Mogaung]] by the British [[Chindits]] under [[Mike Calvert]] later that month was the beginning of the end for the Japanese garrison at Myitkyina. With supply lines cut, infighting grew between the two local Japanese commanders over their orders regarding the defence of the town. Stillwell had demanded that the Chindits join them but they were whittled down by disease and combat. Stillwell nevertheless was reinforced by the arrival of elements of [[Francis Festing]]'s [[36th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|36th Division]] from 15 July Myitkyina airfield. On hearing of the weakening Japanese garrison in Myitkyina, Stillwell sent that Division not to take Myitkyina but to advance on the 'Railway Corridor' from Mogaung towards [[Indaw]] on the right flank of [[Northern Combat Area Command|NCAC]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pitt |first1=Barrie |editor1-last=Hart |editor1-first=Basil Henry Liddell |title=History of the Second World War, Volume 6 History of the Second World War |date=1966 |publisher=Purnell |page=2584 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VZhd6Wyp9jUC&q=}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 Jul, the American 3rd Battalion of the Marauders made a significant gain by capturing the northern air field at Myitkyina and over the next week Japanese resistance was noticeably weaker.<ref>{{cite book |last1=United States Department of State |title=Newsletter |date=1961 |publisher=Bureau of Administration |page=13 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3ZyHm0bkYy4C&dq=}}</ref>\n\nOn August 3, General Genzo Mizukami ordered the town abandoned and took his life in a literal compliance to \"defend Myitkyina to the death\" as the Chinese and US forces gradually cleared the city and the surrounding area of Japanese troops.<ref>[http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/M/y/Myitkyina.htm Pacific War Online]</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe operations against Myitkyina was particularly hard on the Chinese Expeditionary Force, due to the hard fighting, lack of supplies, difficult terrain, and disease.
