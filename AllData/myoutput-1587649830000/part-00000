This investment in and development of intangibles such as software is a core contributor to value creation and economic growth for companies in the digital economy<ref name=\":2\" />. In early 2000, companies have started to substantially increase the amount of capital advocated to intangibles such as branding, design and, technology rather than in hardware, machinery or property<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/blogs/ib-knowledge/rise-intangible-economy-how-capitalism-without-capital-fostering-inequality/|title=The rise of the intangible economy: how capitalism without capital is fostering inequality|website=Imperial College Business School|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.\n\n==== Mobility of business functions ====\nAdvancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) have significantly reduced the cost associated with the organization and coordination of complex activities over a long period. Long businesses are increasingly able to manage their global operations on an integrated basis from a central location that may be removed geographically from both the locations in which the operations are carried out and the locations in which their suppliers or customers are located. Consequently, it allowed to expand access to remote markets and thus, provided an opportunity to provide those goods and services across the borders<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n=== Reliance on Data ===\nThe Digital economy relies on personal data collection. In 1995, the [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection directive]] (Directive 95/46/CE, art.2), defined data as \u201cany information relating to a natural person who can be identified by reference to his identification number or to information which is specific to him\u201d.\u00a0 At that time, this regulation emerged in response to the need to integrate the European market. By adopting common European data protection standards, the EU was able to harmonize conflicting national laws that were emerging as a trade barrier, inhibiting commerce in Europe<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32006L0123|title=L_2006376FR.01003601.xml|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>. For this reason, [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] and its predecessor were viewed as internal market instruments, facilitating the creation of a digital, single market by allowing an unhindered flow of data within the entire common market<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bradford|first=Anu|title=The Brussels effect|publisher=Oxford Press University|year=2019|isbn=|location=|chapter=Chap. 5|pages=131\u2013169}}</ref>. \n\nDue to its ability to bridge the information asymmetry between supply and demand, data now has an economic value. When platforms compile personal data, they gather preferences and interests, which allow companies to exert a targeted action on the consumer through advertising. Algorithms classify, reference and prioritize the preferences of individuals to better predict their behavior.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.strategie.gouv.fr/debats/economie-numerique-fiscalite|title=Economie num\u00e9rique et fiscalit\u00e9|website=www.strategie.gouv.fr|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nVia free access to platforms in exchange for the collection of personal data, they make the content non-rival. Thus, the intangibility of content tends to give a collective natural aspect to this information accessible to everyone, to benefit public good which would create a digital public space<ref name=\":3\" />. The McKinsey Global Institute Report (McKinsey Global Institute report, 2014) notes five broad ways in which leveraging big data can create value for businesses:\n\n# Creating transparency by making data more easily accessible in a promptly on time to stakeholders with the capacity to use the data.\n# Managing performance by enabling experimentation to analyze variability in performance and understand its root causes.\n# Segmenting populations to customize products and services.\n# Improve decision making by replacing or supporting human decision making with automated algorithms.\n# Improve the development of new business models, products, and services.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Global flows in digital age: how trade, finance, people and data connect the world economy|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Globalization/Global%20flows%20in%20a%20digital%20age/Global_flows_in_a_digital_age_Full_report%20March_2015.ashx|journal=McKinsey Global Institue Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the Boston Consulting Group estimated that personal data collected in Europe was worth 315 billion euros <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite report|last=|first=|date=February 26, 2015|title=Taxation and the Digital economy: a survey of theoretical models|publisher=France Strat\u00e9gie|orig-year=Final report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/ficalite_du_numerique_9_mars_13_h.pdf|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.\n\n=== Network effet ===\nThis new economic model is based on the 'Network effect'. It occurs when the value of a product or service to\u00a0 the user increases exponentially with the number of other users using the same product or service. For instance, [[WhatsApp]] provides a free communication platform with friends and contacts. The utility to use it relies on the fact that a substantial part of or friends and colleagues are already users. The attractivity relies here on the snowball effect <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/01/02/how-to-harness-the-power-of-network-effects/|title=Council Post: How To Harness The Power Of Network Effects|last=Reddy|first=Nirmala|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Multi-sided market ===\nThe Digital market is a market can be labeled as a \u2018multi-sided\u2019 market. The notion developed by French [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] laureate [[Jean Tirole]] is based on the idea that platforms are \u2018two-sided\u2019. This feature allows to explain why these platforms can propose freely their content, with customers on one side and the software developers or advertisers on the other. On a market where multiple groups of persons interact through platforms as intermediaries, the decisions of each group affect the outcome of the other group of persons through a positive or negative externality <ref>{{Cite news|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/upshot/how-jean-tiroles-work-helps-explain-the-internet-economy.html|title=How Jean Tirole's Work Helps Explain the Internet Economy|date=2014-10-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>. When the users spend time on a page or click on links, this creates a positive externality for the advertiser displaying a banner there.

Due to the immaterial nature of digital activities, these digital multinational enterprises (MNEs) are extremely mobile, which allows them to optimize tax evasion. They can carry out high volumes of sales from a tax jurisdiction. Concretely, governments face MNE fiscal optimization from companies locating their activity in the countries where tax is the lowest. On the other hand, companies can undergo double-taxation for the same activity or be confronted with legal and tax vagueness.

This gave a new dimension to the Market. The proposal for the DSM had been made under the strategy of the Commission entitled \u201c[[Digital Agenda for Europe]]\u201d in the political guidelines of the second Barroso Commission and pointed out the need to eliminate barriers in order to implement the European Digital Market as an attempt to relaunch the [[European Single Market|Single Market.]] This strategy was similar to the one used for the [[European Single Market|Internal Market]] in 1985 <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=M\u0103rcu\u0163|first=M.|title=Crystalizing the EU digital policy: An exploration into the digital single market|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> and focused on one of the weaknesses of this latter namely the fragmentation of the national digital market. Building on the Monti report, the communication 'Towards a Single Market Act' detailed 50 proposals to reform the SM by the end of 2012. But the DSM was only adopted in 2015 and the proposal for a directive of the [[European Parliament]] and the Council was made in September 2016. \n\nThe '''DSM''' is presented as a key priority in the economy of Union, even if there were several attempts to deepen the integration, there are still obstacles remaining. The creation of the DSM constitutes, a catalyst to resolve several issues, and was supposed to have a widespread multiplier effect throughout sectors across the EU.<ref name=\":8\" /> The EU Commission had to face several obstacles. The commission acts in a way to deeply transform the SM. However, the EC lack of political support to enhance the impact of its decision<ref name=\":7\" />The issue of the low salience was a causal factor explaining the limits of the commission\u2019s commitment to reform the single market. Even though the member states approved the DSM, and the definition for the DSM was accepted by European institutions as a key priority, only one proposal was adopted at the end of 2012. Despite being a priority in the SMA I & II, legislative initiatives failed due to the high cost of implementation measures. Also, there were its potential \u2018blockbuster for economic gains\u2019\u00a0<ref name=\":7\" /> and the protest of citizens against sovereign debt countries rescues and bail-out banks. The slow adoption of the proposal is partly due to [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]\u2019 protectionist temptations after the economic crisis. Each state wanted to put forward its preferences and legislation about concerning this field. \n\nWith regard to [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), the Commission adopted various initiatives with no meaningful coordination. The more pervasive the digital ecosystem becomes, the more sector-specific regulatory framework should be merged into general regimes. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Renda|first=Andrea|date=2017|title=Will the DSM Strategy Spur Innovation ?|url=|journal=Intereconomics|volume=52|issue=4|pages=197\u2013201|doi=10.1007/s10272-017-0674-7|hdl=10419/172813}}</ref>\n\nEven if the [[European Commission|Commission]] used the crisis as a window of opportunity, it did not allow to go deeper and further in implementing a high transformation of the Single Market (SM). The crisis context pushed the political actors to move forward to better manage the crisis, but it does not permit to fully implement the DSM. \n\n==== Current challenges ====\nOne of the key priorities of the EU is to guarantee fair competition. Yet, within the Digital Market, the competition seems to be distorted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benhamou|first=Fran\u00e7oise|date=February 2018|title=Quelle r\u00e9gulation face aux plateformes num\u00e9riques?|journal=Annales des Mines - R\u00e9alit\u00e9s industrielles|volume=2018|issue=1|pages=75\u201378|doi=10.3917/rindu1.181.0075}}</ref> The more network effects are exerted, the higher the barriers to entry (difficulty for a new entrant to enter the market and compete) in the hub market.

It seems difficult for the regulators to sanction them, in the way that the [[Big Tech|GAFA]] provides jobs and services worldwide.\n\n==== Challenges for the regulator ====\nThe problems remain plural for the regulators. They need to identify and define platforms. There is no possibility to regulate exante to limit the size of the platform. The European Commission can sanction afterwards when the platform abuse already of its dominant position. Moreover, Member-states lack coordination, and may be independent of the regulator, who can\u2019t have a global vision of the market. Tax evasion of digital MNEs has become a growing concern for most of the European governments, including the European Commission. Attracting foreign investment is less and less seen as a relevant reason to implement tax cuts. Aside from the fiscal revenue shortfall, this issue has taken a political turn in recent years since people and politicians feel that, in a time of financial crisis, these highly profitable firms do not contribute to the national effort. <ref name=\":4\" />\n<br />\n\n=== The main strength within the EU digital policy ===\n'''Digital Market''' is characterized by its heterogeneity <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=GAGLIO|first=Cyrielle|first2=Sarah|last2=GUILLIOU|date=2018|title=L'Europe num\u00e9rique.

The EU sanctions cartels\u2019 behavior and examines mergers in order to preserve competition and protect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to enter the market. Within the digital market, the merger is the rule to build a digital giant, it\u2019s can be a brake to construct digital European giant. Indeed, in a way, the EU regulator may handicap giant to build themselves, and do not inject as well money in the sector. Moreover, the EU could be a leader in regulation to protect people working in the digital sector or for the digital sector (such as [[Uber]]\u2019s driver, a case recently in France), which could a window of opportunity. However, the EU needs to be cautious with its regulation in order to create barriers at the market entry. <ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== European Commission versus Google =====\nThe [[European Commission]] (EC) decided to fine [[Google]] \u20ac2.42 billion for abusing its dominant position as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to Google Shopping. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blanckenburg|first=K.|date=2018|title=Google search abuses dominant position to illegally favour Google Shopping: an economic review of the EU decision|url=|journal=Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance|volume=20|issue=3|pages=211\u2013224|doi=10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0020}}</ref>The EC aimed to pave the way to concurrent who suffers from its abuse of dominant position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/margrethe-vestager-google-strategy-first-big-court-test/|title=Vestager's Google strategy faces its first big court test|last=Van Dorpe|first=Simon |date=2020-02-03|website=POLITICO|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Moreover, it proved that the strategy of the EC does work and may fine companies at a great rate. \n\n===== Junker Commission =====\nThe '''Digital Economy''' has been a concern for the Commission concern since the 1st [[Barroso Commission|Barroso]] Commission. Yet, it is only under the Junker that the strategy of the DSM was adopted on the 6th May 2015 as it was ranked as the second priority out of the '''10 priorities''' for the new Commission\u2019s mandate. Throughout this document, the DSM emphasized 3 policy pillars: \n\n# improving access to digital goods and services\n# an environment where digital networks and services can prosper\n# digital as a driver of growth. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/factsheets-commissions-10-priorities_en|title=Factsheets on the Commission's 10 priorities|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nAs a key priority for the newly President-elect [[Juncker Commission|Juncker]], he made [[Andrus Ansip]], the vice-president of the Commission, in charge of the DSM. The decision to approach the DSM from a different point of view is also because the digital space is in constant evolution with the growing importance of online platform and the change of market share<ref name=\":8\" />. The DSM was a priority because of its economic importance; the total of EU e-commerce reached 240 billion \u20ac in 2011, and out of that 44 billion were cross-border trade between member state.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ALVAREZ Le\u00f3n|first=LUIS F.|date=2018|title=A Blueprint for Market Construction? Spatial Data Infrastructure(s), Interoperability, and the EU Digital Single Market|url=|journal=Geoforum|volume=92|pages=45-57}}</ref>\n\n=== Within the new commission ===\nIn 2020, the digital economy continues to be a top priority for the EC, and belongs once again to the agenda of the Commission president. [[Frans Timmermans]] has been designed to be the vice president in charge of one of the '''six priorities of the EC''', called \u201c'''A Europe fit for digital age'''\u201d. The priority is elaborated as follow, EC is working on a digital transformation that will benefit to everyone . These goals are set to open up new opportunities for businesses, to boost the development of trustworthy technology, foster an open and democratic society, enable a vibrant and sustainable economy, and help fight climate change and achieve the green transition. The strategy of digital economy is included in a wider strategy for the future of Europe. However, as explained on the EC\u2019s website, the aim to become a global role model for the digital economy fit within the EU\u2019s goals for decades, as it is the aim in the environmental field. However, the EU had to review its aim in this field, and becomes a 'Leadiator'.  It\u2019s possible that in the '''Digital Economy,''' the EU has to behave and evolves in the same way, because the champions of the digital sector aren't European, which creates a handicap in the way the EU refrain from legislating. The EU cannot restrict the offer to its citizens, because digital leader aren\u2019t mainly Europeans. One objective of the single market is to make available the better quality at the better price, and propose a better choice to its citizens. \n\n== Conclusion ==\nAs explained earlier, the digital economy is based on '''computing technologies.''' More and more business result in the connection around the world. It\u2019s referred to as a '''new type of economy''' that emerges. The rapid spread of ICT all around the world has led to the development of a new kind of product and services, that changes the way we are doing business today. The '''Digital Economy''' represents today '''15% of the global world GDP'''. It\u2019s relying on '''personal data''', which has been regulated by the EU\u2019s directive of 1995, which had the goal to integrate EU within the Digital market. [[Digital Single Market]] has been for long a priority for the EU and has  beneficiated of the 2007 crisis as a window of opportunity to act. However, we see how the mandate of the EC is thin, to the heterogeneity of the market, and the fact that the EU has to act ex-post. As a result, Member States '''lack of coordination'''. The goals of the Single Market concerning consumers, is to offer a panel of choice at a better price. Yet, the champions of the '''Digital market aren\u2019t Europeans'''. Due to the network effect, barriers to European businesses that want to enter within the market, the barriers remain even higher. '''Dominant position''' harbored by '''US big tech platforms''' do not give a wide possibility of manoeuver combined with the volatility of the market. \n<br />\n\n== Critics/debate ==\n\n=== Rise of intangible capitalism ===\nThe digital economy is also qualified as \"intangible capitalism\"f which fosters inequality and social division. In 2017, Haskel and Westlake published \u201ccapitalism without capital\u201d which raises concerns about policymakers\u2019 inability to tailor from the transition of the traditional economy to the New Economy based on intangible assets. From the mid-2000s onwards, companies have been investing more in \u2018intangibles\u2019 such as branding, design, and technology than they have in machinery, hardware or property.\n\nBusinesses such as Uber don\u2019t own cars, they own software and data. Coffee bars and gyms rely on branding to help them stand out from the crowd. Pharmaceutical companies have vast budgets for marketing as well as research and development.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs opposed to the traditional production where the marginal cost of production decreases after the first unit produced which doesn\u2019t apply to the software. Once the first unit is produced such as data, insurance, e-books, even movies, the rest of the production is virtually free. As the proportion of the world\u2019s economy that doesn\u2019t fit the old model keeps getting larger, it has implications for a wide range of policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Capitalism-Without-Capital|title=Not enough people are paying attention to this economic trend|last=Gates|first=Bill|website=gatesnotes.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe intangibility of assets may widen the gap between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinationals enterprises (MNEs). On the one hand, the current bank system struggles to value and monitor immaterial assets. In the old days, when a company went bankrupt, banks could recover their money by selling the physical assets such as buildings, machinery, etc. Yet, if the intangible assets drop, those assets. can\u2019t be sold easily as they as the value of the company goes down. As a result, SMEs are more reliant on venture capital which is different than bank financing. The easier access to resources allow MNEs to benefit from synergies of the intangible assets. For instance, In creating the iPod, Apple combined MP3 technology with licensing agreements, record labels, and design expertise to produce a winning product. This ability to combine technologies and then scale up to help these companies to increase their dominant position on the market.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Exploitation of labour forces ===\n\n==== Expansion of Global value chains ====\nThe digital economy has accelerated the spread of global value chains in which Multinationals enterprises (MNEs) integrate their worldwide operations.<ref name=OECD2017/> These advances, coupled with liberalization of trade policy and reduction in transportation costs, have expanded the ability of businesses in all sectors to take advantage of global value chains in which production processes can be geographically dispersed in locations around the world to take advantage of the features of local markets.<ref name=\":2\" /> It\u2019s easier for firms to implement their activities where there are low wages and to coordinate their activities from countries with high wages.\n\n==== Bypassing labor laws ====\nThe rise of online platforms raises concerns in terms of legal questions about social security and labor law. Since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, there is an increase in '[[Uberisation|uberization]]' of work. As within a company that gives its name to this phenomenon, workers are defined as \u2018independent workers\u2019 (with temporary, off-site, autonomous contracts) which challenges the application of labor and occupational health and safety law. As a result, online platforms encourage the flexibilization of jobs and a higher volatility of the labor market rather than on traditional companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garben|first=Sacha|title=The regulatory challenge of occupational safety and health in the online platform economy|url=|journal=International Social Security Review|year=2019|volume=72|issue=3|pages=95\u2013112|doi=10.1111/issr.12215}}</ref> \u2018[[Gig economy]]\u2019 companies such as [[Deliveroo]] and [[Uber]] hire drivers which are self-employed and sign a contract with the digital platform while the way they work is much regular to a regular employee statute. Yet, for the first time in March 2020, France\u2019s top court (Cour de Cassation) ruling acknowledged that a Uber driver could not qualify as a \u2018self-employed\u2019 contractor because he could not build his clientele or set his prices, establishing a relation of a subordinate of the company. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-court-idUSKBN20R23F|title=Top French court deals blow to Uber by giving driver 'employee' status|date=2020-03-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Intensification of the global competition for human resources ====\nDigital platforms rely on '[[deep learning]]' to scale up their algorithm\u2019s capacity. The human-powered content labeling industry is constantly growing as companies seek to harness data for AI training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-ai-focus-idUSKCN1SC01T|title=Facebook 'labels' posts by hand, posing privacy questions|date=2019-05-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en}}</ref> These practices have raised concerns concerning the low-income revenue and health-related issues of these independent workers. For instance, digital companies such as [[Facebook]] or [[YouTube (channel)|Youtube]] use \u2018content monitor\u2019-contractors who work as outside monitors hired by a professional services company subcontractor- to monitor social media to remove any inappropriate content. Thus, the job consists of watching and listening to disturbing posts that can be violent or sexual. In January 2020, through its subcontractor services society, Facebook and Youtube have asked the \u2018content moderators\u2019 to sign a [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) disclosure after alleged cases of mental disorders witnessed on workers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51245616|title=Social media moderators asked to sign PTSD forms|date=2020-01-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*Petrenko Sergei.

This investment in and development of intangibles such as software is a core contributor to value creation and economic growth for companies in the digital economy<ref name=\":2\" />. In early 2000, companies have started to substantially increase the amount of capital advocated to intangibles such as branding, design and, technology rather than in hardware, machinery or property<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/blogs/ib-knowledge/rise-intangible-economy-how-capitalism-without-capital-fostering-inequality/|title=The rise of the intangible economy: how capitalism without capital is fostering inequality|website=Imperial College Business School|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.\n\n==== Mobility of business functions ====\nAdvancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) have significantly reduced the cost associated with the organization and coordination of complex activities over a long period. Long businesses are increasingly able to manage their global operations on an integrated basis from a central location that may be removed geographically from both the locations in which the operations are carried out and the locations in which their suppliers or customers are located. Consequently, it allowed to expand access to remote markets and thus, provided an opportunity to provide those goods and services across the borders<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n=== Reliance on Data ===\nThe Digital economy relies on personal data collection. In 1995, the [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection directive]] (Directive 95/46/CE, art.2), defined data as \u201cany information relating to a natural person who can be identified by reference to his identification number or to information which is specific to him\u201d.\u00a0 At that time, this regulation emerged in response to the need to integrate the European market. By adopting common European data protection standards, the EU was able to harmonize conflicting national laws that were emerging as a trade barrier, inhibiting commerce in Europe<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32006L0123|title=L_2006376FR.01003601.xml|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>. For this reason, [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] and its predecessor were viewed as internal market instruments, facilitating the creation of a digital, single market by allowing an unhindered flow of data within the entire common market<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bradford|first=Anu|title=The Brussels effect|publisher=Oxford Press University|year=2019|isbn=|location=|chapter=Chap. 5|pages=131\u2013169}}</ref>. \n\nDue to its ability to bridge the information asymmetry between supply and demand, data now has an economic value. When platforms compile personal data, they gather preferences and interests, which allow companies to exert a targeted action on the consumer through advertising. Algorithms classify, reference and prioritize the preferences of individuals to better predict their behavior.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.strategie.gouv.fr/debats/economie-numerique-fiscalite|title=Economie num\u00e9rique et fiscalit\u00e9|website=www.strategie.gouv.fr|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nVia free access to platforms in exchange for the collection of personal data, they make the content non-rival. Thus, the intangibility of content tends to give a collective natural aspect to this information accessible to everyone, to benefit public good which would create a digital public space<ref name=\":3\" />. The McKinsey Global Institute Report (McKinsey Global Institute report, 2014) notes five broad ways in which leveraging big data can create value for businesses:\n\n# Creating transparency by making data more easily accessible in a promptly on time to stakeholders with the capacity to use the data.\n# Managing performance by enabling experimentation to analyze variability in performance and understand its root causes.\n# Segmenting populations to customize products and services.\n# Improve decision making by replacing or supporting human decision making with automated algorithms.\n# Improve the development of new business models, products, and services.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Global flows in digital age: how trade, finance, people and data connect the world economy|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Globalization/Global%20flows%20in%20a%20digital%20age/Global_flows_in_a_digital_age_Full_report%20March_2015.ashx|journal=McKinsey Global Institue Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the Boston Consulting Group estimated that personal data collected in Europe was worth 315 billion euros <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite report|last=|first=|date=February 26, 2015|title=Taxation and the Digital economy: a survey of theoretical models|publisher=France Strat\u00e9gie|orig-year=Final report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/ficalite_du_numerique_9_mars_13_h.pdf|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.\n\n=== Network effet ===\nThis new economic model is based on the 'Network effect'. It occurs when the value of a product or service to\u00a0 the user increases exponentially with the number of other users using the same product or service. For instance, [[WhatsApp]] provides a free communication platform with friends and contacts. The utility to use it relies on the fact that a substantial part of or friends and colleagues are already users. The attractivity relies here on the snowball effect <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/01/02/how-to-harness-the-power-of-network-effects/|title=Council Post: How To Harness The Power Of Network Effects|last=Reddy|first=Nirmala|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Multi-sided market ===\nThe Digital market is a market can be labeled as a \u2018multi-sided\u2019 market. The notion developed by French [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] laureate [[Jean Tirole]] is based on the idea that platforms are \u2018two-sided\u2019. This feature allows to explain why these platforms can propose freely their content, with customers on one side and the software developers or advertisers on the other. On a market where multiple groups of persons interact through platforms as intermediaries, the decisions of each group affect the outcome of the other group of persons through a positive or negative externality <ref>{{Cite news|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/upshot/how-jean-tiroles-work-helps-explain-the-internet-economy.html|title=How Jean Tirole's Work Helps Explain the Internet Economy|date=2014-10-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>. When the users spend time on a page or click on links, this creates a positive externality for the advertiser displaying a banner there. The digital Multinational entreprises (MNEs) doesn\u2019t collect revenue from the user side but from the advertiser one, thanks to the sale of online advertisement.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Tendency to oligopoly and monopoly formation ===\nAs a result, the outcomes of these intertwined and combined effects tend to lead to the formation of dominant market positions, also called digital monopoly or oligopoly<ref name=\":2\" /> In this sense, digital platforms such as the [[Big Tech|GAFA]] (Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon) can be considered as first movers -large companies that introduce a service or a product on an immature market, allowing that company to establish strong brand recognition and service loyalty <ref>{{Cite journal|last=CIRIANI|first=St\u00e9phane|last2=LEBOURGES|first2=Marc|date=June 2017|title=the Market Dominance of US Digital Platforms: Antitrust implications for the European Union|journal=SSRN|volume=|pages=|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2977933}}</ref>.\n\n==Response==\nGiven its expected broad impact, traditional firms are actively assessing how to respond to the changes brought about by the digital economy.<ref>[http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/essays_in_digital_transformation Internet matters: Essays in digital transformation | McKinsey & Company].

Due to the immaterial nature of digital activities, these digital multinational enterprises (MNEs) are extremely mobile, which allows them to optimize tax evasion. They can carry out high volumes of sales from a tax jurisdiction. Concretely, governments face MNE fiscal optimization from companies locating their activity in the countries where tax is the lowest. On the other hand, companies can undergo double-taxation for the same activity or be confronted with legal and tax vagueness.

Even if the question had already come up earlier in 1990 and was brought up again later in 2010<ref name=\":6\" />, it emerged at a sensitive moment in the post-crisis of 2008, used as a catalyst for action <ref>{{Cite book|last=Hatzopoulos|first=Vassilis|title=\"La justification des atteintes aux libert\u00e9s de circulation: cadre m\u00e9thodologique et sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s mat\u00e9rielles|publisher=College of Europe|year=2013|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=3\u20134}}</ref>. The crisis opened a window for opportunities to place the Single Market upfront in the European agenda and was aimed to resolve two issues: financial supervision and economic coordination <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Camis\u00e3o|first=Isabel|last2=Guimar\u00e3es|first2=Maria H.|date=March 2017|title=The Commission, the Single Market and the Crisis: The Limits of Purposeful Opportunism|journal=Journal of Common Market Studies|volume=55|issue=2|pages=223\u2013239|doi=10.1111/jcms.12464}}</ref>. This gave a new dimension to the Market. The proposal for the DSM had been made under the strategy of the Commission entitled \u201c[[Digital Agenda for Europe]]\u201d in the political guidelines of the second Barroso Commission and pointed out the need to eliminate barriers in order to implement the European Digital Market as an attempt to relaunch the [[European Single Market|Single Market.]] This strategy was similar to the one used for the [[European Single Market|Internal Market]] in 1985 <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=M\u0103rcu\u0163|first=M.|title=Crystalizing the EU digital policy: An exploration into the digital single market|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> and focused on one of the weaknesses of this latter namely the fragmentation of the national digital market. Building on the Monti report, the communication 'Towards a Single Market Act' detailed 50 proposals to reform the SM by the end of 2012. But the DSM was only adopted in 2015 and the proposal for a directive of the [[European Parliament]] and the Council was made in September 2016. \n\nThe '''DSM''' is presented as a key priority in the economy of Union, even if there were several attempts to deepen the integration, there are still obstacles remaining. The creation of the DSM constitutes, a catalyst to resolve several issues, and was supposed to have a widespread multiplier effect throughout sectors across the EU.<ref name=\":8\" /> The EU Commission had to face several obstacles. The commission acts in a way to deeply transform the SM. However, the EC lack of political support to enhance the impact of its decision<ref name=\":7\" />The issue of the low salience was a causal factor explaining the limits of the commission\u2019s commitment to reform the single market. Even though the member states approved the DSM, and the definition for the DSM was accepted by European institutions as a key priority, only one proposal was adopted at the end of 2012. Despite being a priority in the SMA I & II, legislative initiatives failed due to the high cost of implementation measures. Also, there were its potential \u2018blockbuster for economic gains\u2019\u00a0<ref name=\":7\" /> and the protest of citizens against sovereign debt countries rescues and bail-out banks. The slow adoption of the proposal is partly due to [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]\u2019 protectionist temptations after the economic crisis. Each state wanted to put forward its preferences and legislation about concerning this field. \n\nWith regard to [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), the Commission adopted various initiatives with no meaningful coordination. The more pervasive the digital ecosystem becomes, the more sector-specific regulatory framework should be merged into general regimes. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Renda|first=Andrea|date=2017|title=Will the DSM Strategy Spur Innovation ?|url=|journal=Intereconomics|volume=52|issue=4|pages=197\u2013201|doi=10.1007/s10272-017-0674-7|hdl=10419/172813}}</ref>\n\nEven if the [[European Commission|Commission]] used the crisis as a window of opportunity, it did not allow to go deeper and further in implementing a high transformation of the Single Market (SM). The crisis context pushed the political actors to move forward to better manage the crisis, but it does not permit to fully implement the DSM. \n\n==== Current challenges ====\nOne of the key priorities of the EU is to guarantee fair competition. Yet, within the Digital Market, the competition seems to be distorted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benhamou|first=Fran\u00e7oise|date=February 2018|title=Quelle r\u00e9gulation face aux plateformes num\u00e9riques?|journal=Annales des Mines - R\u00e9alit\u00e9s industrielles|volume=2018|issue=1|pages=75\u201378|doi=10.3917/rindu1.181.0075}}</ref> The more network effects are exerted, the higher the barriers to entry (difficulty for a new entrant to enter the market and compete) in the hub market.

It seems difficult for the regulators to sanction them, in the way that the [[Big Tech|GAFA]] provides jobs and services worldwide.\n\n==== Challenges for the regulator ====\nThe problems remain plural for the regulators. They need to identify and define platforms. There is no possibility to regulate exante to limit the size of the platform. The European Commission can sanction afterwards when the platform abuse already of its dominant position. Moreover, Member-states lack coordination, and may be independent of the regulator, who can\u2019t have a global vision of the market. Tax evasion of digital MNEs has become a growing concern for most of the European governments, including the European Commission. Attracting foreign investment is less and less seen as a relevant reason to implement tax cuts. Aside from the fiscal revenue shortfall, this issue has taken a political turn in recent years since people and politicians feel that, in a time of financial crisis, these highly profitable firms do not contribute to the national effort. <ref name=\":4\" />\n<br />\n\n=== The main strength within the EU digital policy ===\n'''Digital Market''' is characterized by its heterogeneity <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=GAGLIO|first=Cyrielle|first2=Sarah|last2=GUILLIOU|date=2018|title=L'Europe num\u00e9rique.

The EU sanctions cartels\u2019 behavior and examines mergers in order to preserve competition and protect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to enter the market. Within the digital market, the merger is the rule to build a digital giant, it\u2019s can be a brake to construct digital European giant. Indeed, in a way, the EU regulator may handicap giant to build themselves, and do not inject as well money in the sector. Moreover, the EU could be a leader in regulation to protect people working in the digital sector or for the digital sector (such as [[Uber]]\u2019s driver, a case recently in France), which could a window of opportunity. However, the EU needs to be cautious with its regulation in order to create barriers at the market entry. <ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== European Commission versus Google =====\nThe [[European Commission]] (EC) decided to fine [[Google]] \u20ac2.42 billion for abusing its dominant position as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to Google Shopping. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blanckenburg|first=K.|date=2018|title=Google search abuses dominant position to illegally favour Google Shopping: an economic review of the EU decision|url=|journal=Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance|volume=20|issue=3|pages=211\u2013224|doi=10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0020}}</ref>The EC aimed to pave the way to concurrent who suffers from its abuse of dominant position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/margrethe-vestager-google-strategy-first-big-court-test/|title=Vestager's Google strategy faces its first big court test|last=Van Dorpe|first=Simon |date=2020-02-03|website=POLITICO|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Moreover, it proved that the strategy of the EC does work and may fine companies at a great rate. \n\n===== Junker Commission =====\nThe '''Digital Economy''' has been a concern for the Commission concern since the 1st [[Barroso Commission|Barroso]] Commission. Yet, it is only under the Junker that the strategy of the DSM was adopted on the 6th May 2015 as it was ranked as the second priority out of the '''10 priorities''' for the new Commission\u2019s mandate. Throughout this document, the DSM emphasized 3 policy pillars: \n\n# improving access to digital goods and services\n# an environment where digital networks and services can prosper\n# digital as a driver of growth. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/factsheets-commissions-10-priorities_en|title=Factsheets on the Commission's 10 priorities|website=European Commission - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nAs a key priority for the newly President-elect [[Juncker Commission|Juncker]], he made [[Andrus Ansip]], the vice-president of the Commission, in charge of the DSM. The decision to approach the DSM from a different point of view is also because the digital space is in constant evolution with the growing importance of online platform and the change of market share<ref name=\":8\" />.

[[Frans Timmermans]] has been designed to be the vice president in charge of one of the '''six priorities of the EC''', called \u201c'''A Europe fit for digital age'''\u201d. The priority is elaborated as follow, EC is working on a digital transformation that will benefit to everyone . These goals are set to open up new opportunities for businesses, to boost the development of trustworthy technology, foster an open and democratic society, enable a vibrant and sustainable economy, and help fight climate change and achieve the green transition. The strategy of digital economy is included in a wider strategy for the future of Europe. However, as explained on the EC\u2019s website, the aim to become a global role model for the digital economy fit within the EU\u2019s goals for decades, as it is the aim in the environmental field. However, the EU had to review its aim in this field, and becomes a 'Leadiator'.  It\u2019s possible that in the '''Digital Economy,''' the EU has to behave and evolves in the same way, because the champions of the digital sector aren't European, which creates a handicap in the way the EU refrain from legislating. The EU cannot restrict the offer to its citizens, because digital leader aren\u2019t mainly Europeans. One objective of the single market is to make available the better quality at the better price, and propose a better choice to its citizens. \n\n== Conclusion ==\nAs explained earlier, the digital economy is based on '''computing technologies.''' More and more business result in the connection around the world. It\u2019s referred to as a '''new type of economy''' that emerges. The rapid spread of ICT all around the world has lead to the development of a new kind of product and services, that changes the way we are doing business today. The '''Digital Economy''' represents today '''15% of the global world GDP'''. It\u2019s relying on '''personal data''', which has been regulated by the EU\u2019s directive of 1995, which had the goal to integrate EU within the Digital market. [[Digital Single Market]] has been for long a priority for the EU and has  beneficiated of the 2007 crisis as a window of opportunity to act. However, we see how the mandate of the EC is thin, to the heterogeneity of the market, and the fact that the EU has to act ex-post. As a result, Member States '''lack of coordination'''. The goals of the Single Market concerning consumers, is to offer a panel of choice at a better price. Yet, the champions of the '''Digital market aren\u2019t Europeans'''. Due to the network effect, barriers to European businesses that want to enter within the market, the barriers remain even higher. '''Dominant position''' harbored by '''US big tech platforms''' do not give a wide possibility of manoeuver combined with the volatility of the market. \n<br />\n\n== Critics/debate ==\n\n=== Rise of intangible capitalism ===\nThe digital economy is also qualified as \"intangible capitalism\"f which fosters inequality and social division. In 2017, Haskel and Westlake published \u201ccapitalism without capital\u201d which raises concerns about policymakers\u2019 inability to tailor from the transition of the traditional economy to the New Economy based on intangible assets. From the mid-2000s onwards, companies have been investing more in \u2018intangibles\u2019 such as branding, design, and technology than they have in machinery, hardware or property.\n\nBusinesses such as Uber don\u2019t own cars, they own software and data. Coffee bars and gyms rely on branding to help them stand out from the crowd. Pharmaceutical companies have vast budgets for marketing as well as research and development.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs opposed to the traditional production where the marginal cost of production decreases after the first unit produced which doesn\u2019t apply to the software. Once the first unit is produced such as data, insurance, e-books, even movies, the rest of the production is virtually free. As the proportion of the world\u2019s economy that doesn\u2019t fit the old model keeps getting larger, it has implications for a wide range of policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Capitalism-Without-Capital|title=Not enough people are paying attention to this economic trend|last=Gates|first=Bill|website=gatesnotes.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe intangibility of assets may widen the gap between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinationals enterprises (MNEs). On the one hand, the current bank system struggles to value and monitor immaterial assets. In the old days, when a company went bankrupt, banks could recover their money by selling the physical assets such as buildings, machinery, etc. Yet, if the intangible assets drop, those assets. can\u2019t be sold easily as they as the value of the company goes down. As a result, SMEs are more reliant on venture capital which is different than bank financing. The easier access to resources allow MNEs to benefit from synergies of the intangible assets. For instance, In creating the iPod, Apple combined MP3 technology with licensing agreements, record labels, and design expertise to produce a winning product. This ability to combine technologies and then scale up to help these companies to increase their dominant position on the market.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Exploitation of labour forces ===\n\n==== Expansion of Global value chains ====\nThe digital economy has accelerated the spread of global value chains in which Multinationals enterprises (MNEs) integrate their worldwide operations.<ref name=OECD2017/> These advances, coupled with liberalization of trade policy and reduction in transportation costs, have expanded the ability of businesses in all sectors to take advantage of global value chains in which production processes can be geographically dispersed in locations around the world to take advantage of the features of local markets.<ref name=\":2\" /> It\u2019s easier for firms to implement their activities where there are low wages and to coordinate their activities from countries with high wages.\n\n==== Bypassing labor laws ====\nThe rise of online platforms raises concerns in terms of legal questions about social security and labor law. Since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, there is an increase in '[[Uberisation|uberization]]' of work. As within a company that gives its name to this phenomenon, workers are defined as \u2018independent workers\u2019 (with temporary, off-site, autonomous contracts) which challenges the application of labor and occupational health and safety law. As a result, online platforms encourage the flexibilization of jobs and a higher volatility of the labor market rather than on traditional companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garben|first=Sacha|title=The regulatory challenge of occupational safety and health in the online platform economy|url=|journal=International Social Security Review|year=2019|volume=72|issue=3|pages=95\u2013112|doi=10.1111/issr.12215}}</ref> \u2018[[Gig economy]]\u2019 companies such as [[Deliveroo]] and [[Uber]] hire drivers which are self-employed and sign a contract with the digital platform while the way they work is much regular to a regular employee statute. Yet, for the first time in March 2020, France\u2019s top court (Cour de Cassation) ruling acknowledged that a Uber driver could not qualify as a \u2018self-employed\u2019 contractor because he could not build his clientele or set his prices, establishing a relation of a subordinate of the company. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-court-idUSKBN20R23F|title=Top French court deals blow to Uber by giving driver 'employee' status|date=2020-03-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Intensification of the global competition for human resources ====\nDigital platforms rely on '[[deep learning]]' to scale up their algorithm\u2019s capacity. The human-powered content labeling industry is constantly growing as companies seek to harness data for AI training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-ai-focus-idUSKCN1SC01T|title=Facebook 'labels' posts by hand, posing privacy questions|date=2019-05-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en}}</ref> These practices have raised concerns concerning the low-income revenue and health-related issues of these independent workers. For instance, digital companies such as [[Facebook]] or [[YouTube (channel)|Youtube]] use \u2018content monitor\u2019-contractors who work as outside monitors hired by a professional services company subcontractor- to monitor social media to remove any inappropriate content. Thus, the job consists of watching and listening to disturbing posts that can be violent or sexual. In January 2020, through its subcontractor services society, Facebook and Youtube have asked the \u2018content moderators\u2019 to sign a [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) disclosure after alleged cases of mental disorders witnessed on workers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51245616|title=Social media moderators asked to sign PTSD forms|date=2020-01-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*Petrenko Sergei.
