Its name comes from this species' name in [[Arabic languages|Arabic]]: ''fanak'' ({{Lang|ar|\u0641\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0643}})''.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fennec|title=Definition of FENNEC|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> The fennec is the smallest species of [[canid]]. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, [[desert]] environments. Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear [[prey]] moving underground. It mainly eats [[Insect|insects]], small [[Mammal|mammals]], and [[Bird|birds]].\n\nThe fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild. Its main predators are the African varieties of [[Verreaux's eagle-owl|eagle owl]], [[Jackal|jackals]], and other large mammals. Families of fennecs dig out [[Burrow|dens]] in the sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as {{convert|120|sqm|0|abbr=on}} and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the genus ''[[Vulpes]]''; however, this is debated due to differences between the fennec fox and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, the animal is considered an [[exotic pet]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe fennec fox weighs about {{convert|0.7|-|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with a body length of between {{convert|24|-|41|cm|0|abbr=on}}; it is around {{convert|20.3|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall.

The basic social unit is thought to be a mated pair and their offspring, and the young of the previous year are believed to remain in the family even after a new litter is born. Playing behavior is common, including with adults of the species.<ref name=\"canids\"/> Fennec foxes make a variety of sounds, including barking, a purring sound similar to that of a domestic cat, and a snarl if threatened.<ref>Alderton, p. 146.</ref>\n\nCaptive animals engage in highly social behaviors, typically resting while in contact with each other. Males tend to show more [[aggression]] and [[Urination|urine-marking]] around the time of the females' [[estrous cycle]]. They have been seen to bury feces by pushing [[soil]] with their noses or hind feet when in captivity. Much remains unknown of their basic ecology and behavior in the wild, and a 2004 report by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] stated that \"in-depth study of the species, with particular emphasis on habitat use and population dynamics in the wild, is overdue.\"<ref name=\"canids\"/>\n\n=== Diet and hunting ===\n[[File:Fennecus zerda 05 MWNH 1387.JPG|thumb|right|Skull]]\n\nThe fennec fox is an omnivore.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.25225/fozo.v61.i1.a10.2012|title = First quantitative data on the diet of the fennec fox, Vulpes zerda (Canidae, Carnivora), in Algeria|journal = Folia Zoologica|volume = 61|pages = 61\u201370|year = 2012|last1 = Brahmi|first1 = Karima|last2 = Khechekhouche|first2 = El Amin|last3 = Mostefaoui|first3 = Otman|last4 = Doumandji|first4 = Salaheddine|last5 = Baziz|first5 = Belkacem|last6 = Aulagnier|first6 = St\u00e9phane}}</ref> Food sources include [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[egg (biology)|egg]]s,<ref name=\"seaworld\"/> and rabbits.<ref>[http://www.canids.org/species/Fennec_fox.pdf Fennec fox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110085838/http://www.canids.org/species/Fennec_fox.pdf |date=10 November 2011 }}. canids.org</ref><ref>Alderton, p. 144.</ref> An individual can jump up to {{convert|2|ft|cm|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on}} forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators.<ref name=\"nobleman\"/> When hunting, large-eared foxes such as the fennec, or the [[bat-eared fox]], can seem to stare at the ground while they rotate their heads from side to side to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground.<ref name=\"rogers\">{{cite book|title=Spirit of the Wild Dog: The World of Wolves, Coyotes, Foxes, Jackals and Dingoes |last=Rogers |first=Leslie J.|year=2003 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-1-86508-673-6|pages=46\u201347 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GndDw_cxV1UC|accessdate=19 December 2009}}</ref> There are reports that fennec foxes climb date palms while foraging for fruit; however, some experts consider these reports unlikely unless low branches are available for support.<ref>Alderton, pp. 144\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe species can live without free water, as its [[kidney]]s are adapted to restrict water loss.

Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, [[desert]] environments. Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear [[prey]] moving underground. It mainly eats [[Insect|insects]], small [[Mammal|mammals]], and [[Bird|birds]].\n\nThe fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild. Its main predators are the African varieties of [[Verreaux's eagle-owl|eagle owl]], [[Jackal|jackals]], and other large mammals. Families of fennecs dig out [[Burrow|dens]] in the sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as {{convert|120|sqm|0|abbr=on}} and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the genus ''[[Vulpes]]''; however, this is debated due to differences between the fennec fox and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, the animal is considered an [[exotic pet]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe fennec fox weighs about {{convert|0.7|-|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with a body length of between {{convert|24|-|41|cm|0|abbr=on}}; it is around {{convert|20.3|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall.

The basic social unit is thought to be a mated pair and their offspring, and the young of the previous year are believed to remain in the family even after a new litter is born. Playing behavior is common, including with adults of the species.<ref name=\"canids\"/> Fennec foxes make a variety of sounds, including barking, a purring sound similar to that of a domestic cat, and a snarl if threatened.<ref>Alderton, p. 146.</ref>\n\nCaptive animals engage in highly social behaviors, typically resting while in contact with each other. Males tend to show more [[aggression]] and [[Urination|urine-marking]] around the time of the females' [[estrous cycle]]. They have been seen to bury feces by pushing [[soil]] with their noses or hind feet when in captivity. Much remains unknown of their basic ecology and behavior in the wild, and a 2004 report by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] stated that \"in-depth study of the species, with particular emphasis on habitat use and population dynamics in the wild, is overdue.\"<ref name=\"canids\"/>\n\n=== Diet and hunting ===\n[[File:Fennecus zerda 05 MWNH 1387.JPG|thumb|right|Skull]]\n\nThe fennec fox is an omnivore.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.25225/fozo.v61.i1.a10.2012|title = First quantitative data on the diet of the fennec fox, Vulpes zerda (Canidae, Carnivora), in Algeria|journal = Folia Zoologica|volume = 61|pages = 61\u201370|year = 2012|last1 = Brahmi|first1 = Karima|last2 = Khechekhouche|first2 = El Amin|last3 = Mostefaoui|first3 = Otman|last4 = Doumandji|first4 = Salaheddine|last5 = Baziz|first5 = Belkacem|last6 = Aulagnier|first6 = St\u00e9phane}}</ref> Food sources include [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[egg (biology)|egg]]s,<ref name=\"seaworld\"/> and rabbits.<ref>[http://www.canids.org/species/Fennec_fox.pdf Fennec fox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110085838/http://www.canids.org/species/Fennec_fox.pdf |date=10 November 2011 }}. canids.org</ref><ref>Alderton, p. 144.</ref> An individual can jump up to {{convert|2|ft|cm|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on}} forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators.<ref name=\"nobleman\"/> When hunting, large-eared foxes such as the fennec, or the [[bat-eared fox]], can seem to stare at the ground while they rotate their heads from side to side to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground.<ref name=\"rogers\">{{cite book|title=Spirit of the Wild Dog: The World of Wolves, Coyotes, Foxes, Jackals and Dingoes |last=Rogers |first=Leslie J.|year=2003 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-1-86508-673-6|pages=46\u201347 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GndDw_cxV1UC|accessdate=19 December 2009}}</ref> There are reports that fennec foxes climb date palms while foraging for fruit; however, some experts consider these reports unlikely unless low branches are available for support.<ref>Alderton, pp. 144\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe species can live without free water, as its [[kidney]]s are adapted to restrict water loss.
