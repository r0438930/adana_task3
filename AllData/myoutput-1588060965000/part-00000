Further, he stated that Magda and their children supported his refusal to leave Berlin and his resolution to die in the bunker. He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [to commit suicide] if they were old enough to speak for themselves.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}\n\nMagda was among the last to see both Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] before they [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on the afternoon of 30 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=827\u2013828}} On the following day, 1&nbsp;May, Magda and Joseph arranged for SS dentist [[Helmut Kunz]] to inject [[Goebbels children|their six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths. Kunz later stated he gave the children morphine injections, but it was Magda and SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]] (Hitler's personal doctor) who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} Author [[James P.

He surmises that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell states, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated at the time of the deaths to have played a reliable role.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2001}}\n\nMagda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=242}} According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison.\n{{quote|We have demanded monstrous things from the German people, treated other nations with pitiless cruelty.

Although she had a Jewish step-father, she eventually married Joseph Goebbels! My stepmother believes she may have acted as a sort of protecting hand and was involved with the exit visa.

Further, he stated that Magda and their children supported his refusal to leave Berlin and his resolution to die in the bunker. He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [to commit suicide] if they were old enough to speak for themselves.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}\n\nMagda was among the last to see both Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] before they [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on the afternoon of 30 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=827\u2013828}} On the following day, 1&nbsp;May, Magda and Joseph arranged for SS dentist [[Helmut Kunz]] to inject [[Goebbels children|their six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths. Kunz later stated he gave the children morphine injections, but it was Magda and SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]] (Hitler's personal doctor) who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} Author [[James P. O'Donnell]] concluded that although Stumpfegger was probably involved in drugging the children, Magda killed them herself. He surmises that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell states, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated at the time of the deaths to have played a reliable role.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2001}}\n\nMagda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=242}} According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison.\n{{quote|We have demanded monstrous things from the German people, treated other nations with pitiless cruelty.

So you see, Ello, it would be quite impossible for me to go on living. We will take the children with us, they are too good, too lovely for the world which lies ahead. In the days to come Joseph will be regarded as one of the greatest criminals that Germany has ever produced. His children would hear that said daily, people would torment them, despise and humiliate them. They would have to bear the burden of his sins and vengeance would be wreaked on them... It has all happened before. You know how I told you at the time quite frankly what the F\u00fchrer said in the Caf\u00e9 Anast in Munich when he saw the little Jewish boy, you remember?

In the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' she confided to Hitler's secretary [[Traudl Junge]], that \"I would rather have my children die, than live in disgrace, jeered at. My children stand no chance in Germany after the war\".<ref>Junge, Traudl, ''Until the Final Hour''</ref>\n\nThe last survivor of Hitler's bunker, [[Rochus Misch]], gave this account of the events to the [[BBC]]:\n\n{{quote|Straight after Hitler's death, Mrs. Goebbels came down to the bunker with her children.

He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schw\u00e4germann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schw\u00e4germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}}{{efn|[[Johannes Hentschel]] later told Misch a singular conflicting story that Goebbels killed himself in his room in the bunker, and Magda in the ''Vorbunker'', during the early hours of 2&nbsp;May. {{harv|Misch|2014|pp=182, 183}}}} The bodies were then doused with [[gasoline|petrol]], but the remains were only partially burned and not buried.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}}\n\nThe charred corpses were found on the afternoon of 2 May 1945 by Soviet troops.
