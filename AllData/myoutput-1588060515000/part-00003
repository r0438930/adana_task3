It is essentially a modified version of their nuclear propulsion system with heat being generated by [[ethanol]] and oxygen. The combustion of the ethanol and stored oxygen, at a pressure of {{convert|60|atm|MPa|abbr=on}}, generates steam which powers a conventional turbine power plant. This pressure-firing allows exhaust carbon dioxide to be expelled overboard at any depth without an exhaust compressor.\n\nEach MESMA system costs around US$50\u201360 million. As installed on the Scorp\u00e8nes, it requires adding a new {{convert|8.3|m|ft|adj=on}}, 305-tonne hull section to the submarines, and enables a submarine to operate for more than 21 days under water, depending on variables such as speed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nDCNS is also developing second-generation hydrogen fuel cell AIP modules for future Scorp\u00e8ne models.\n\n==Scorp\u00e8ne information leak==\n\nIn mid-August 2016, ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper reported that design details of the Scorp\u00e8ne-class submarine and other ships had been leaked.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-submarines-india-australia-idUSKCN10Z04G|title=France's DCNS says India submarine data leak may be 'economic warfare'|last1=Siegel|first1=Matt|last2=Irish|first2=John|date=24 August 2016|work=Reuters|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715014212/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-submarines-india-australia-idUSKCN10Z04G|archivedate=15 July 2017}}</ref> The leaked information spreads over 22,400 pages and includes detailed information about the submarine's combat and stealth capabilities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/secret-data-on-india-s-scorpene-class-submarines-leaked-report/story-PqS96Ob4G5tGY088F07tzH.html|date=24 August 2016|work=Hindustan Times|title=Secret data on Indian Navy's Scorpene-class submarines leaked|last=Laskar|first=Rezaul H|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826185437/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/secret-data-on-india-s-scorpene-class-submarines-leaked-report/story-PqS96Ob4G5tGY088F07tzH.html |archive-date=26 August 2016}}</ref> The leak also included information about noise levels, submarine frequencies and more.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/scorpene-leak-submarine-what-it-reveals-explained-2994954/|last=Stewart|first=Cameron|date=25 August 2016|title=What the Scorpene leak reveals|work=The Indian Express|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829075024/http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/scorpene-leak-submarine-what-it-reveals-explained-2994954/|archive-date=29 August 2016}}</ref> Despite all the information leaks, [[Indian Navy]] chief [[Admiral]] [[Sunil Lanba]] was quoted as saying that the leaks were being viewed \"very seriously\", but were \"not a matter of much worry\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Scorpene-Leak-serious-not-a-matter-of-worry-says-Navy-Chief/2016/08/30/article3603108.ece |title=Scorpene Leak serious, not a matter of worry, says Navy Chief |work=The New Indian Express |accessdate=2016-08-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831155618/http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Scorpene-Leak-serious-not-a-matter-of-worry-says-Navy-Chief/2016/08/30/article3603108.ece |archivedate=2016-08-31 }}</ref> The report also suggested that an ex-[[French Navy]] officer working as a sub-contractor for DCNS may have been the source of the leak, and that the leaked data may have been written in France in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/French-ex-naval-officer-behind-Scorpene-leak/articleshow/53851448.cms |title=French ex-naval officer behind Scorpene leak? |work=The Times of India |accessdate=2016-08-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829212448/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/French-ex-naval-officer-behind-Scorpene-leak/articleshow/53851448.cms |archivedate=2016-08-29 }}</ref> However, on 30 August 2016, a court in [[New South Wales]] temporarily banned ''The Australian'' from releasing any more confidential data on the Indian Scorp\u00e8ne-class submarines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/scorpene-leak-the-australian-cant-release-confidential-data-says-court-1451867 |title=Scorpene Leak: 'The Australian' Can't Release Confidential Data, Says Court |last=Som |first=Vishnu |work=NDTV |accessdate=2016-08-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830161433/http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/scorpene-leak-the-australian-cant-release-confidential-data-says-court-1451867 |archivedate=2016-08-30 }}</ref>\n\n== Operators ==\n\n=== Chile ===\n[[File:Submarino General Carrera (SS-22).jpg|thumb|''Carrera'' of the Chilean Navy]]\nThe [[Chilean Navy]] ordered two Scorp\u00e8ne-class boats, which replaced two {{sclass-|Oberon|submarine|1}}s retired by the Chilean Navy.
