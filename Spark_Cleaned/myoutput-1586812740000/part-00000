The song was co-written by Cyrus, [[Antonina Armato]] and [[Tim James (music producer)|Tim James]], and produced by [[John Fields (producer)|John Fields]]. It was released on June 17, 2008 by [[Hollywood Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the first [[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|studio album]] released by Cyrus with no ties to her character [[List of Hannah Montana main characters|Hannah Montana]] from the [[Disney Channel]] comedy series [[Hannah Montana|of the same name]]. Also registered as \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", Cyrus developed the song during the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]] while feeling numerous emotions for an ex-boyfriend, mainly anger. The song's release brought allegations that it was about [[Nick Jonas]] of the [[Jonas Brothers]], which Cyrus neither confirmed nor denied. Musically, \"7 Things\" bears aspects of both [[country music|country]] and [[pop punk]], while the lyrics in the song's refrain list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend.\n\n\"7 Things\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics and enjoyed worldwide commercial success, becoming a top ten hit on charts in Australia, Japan, Norway, and the United States. The single was [[Music recording sales certifications|certified gold]] by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), while its appearance on the [[Japan Hot 100]] made \"7 Things\" Cyrus' first song to chart in an Asian country. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Brett Ratner]] and features Cyrus performing the song with a back-up band as many teenage girls lipsync along. The girls clutch a variety of props, such as [[love letter]]s and [[snow globe]]s, inspired by personal items Cyrus' ex had given her. The video was nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award]] at both the 2008 and 2009 award shows. Cyrus promoted the song through several venues including her world tours, the [[Wonder World Tour (Miley Cyrus)|Wonder World Tour]] and the [[Gypsy Heart Tour]].\n\n==Background==\n\"7 Things\" is also under the [[Title (property)|legal title]] of \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", as registered by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=9688182&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524134930/http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=9688182&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |publisher=[[BMI Foundation]] |work=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |title=7 Things }}</ref> Like most of the songs on ''Breakout'', Cyrus conceived \"7 Things\" while traveling on the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]] from October 2007 to January 2008.<ref name=\"onair\">{{cite interview|url=http://ryan.kiisfm.com/cc-common/mediaplayer/player.html?redir=yes&mps=kiisfm.php&mid=http://a1135.g.akamai.net/f/1135/18227/1h/cchannel.download.akamai.com/18227/podcast/LOSANGELES-CA/KIIS-FM/MILEYCYRUS062508.mp3?CPROG=PCAST&CPROG=RICHMEDIA&MARKET=LOSANGELES-CA&NG_FORMAT=personality&NG_ID=RYAN1027IP&OR_NEWSFORMAT=&OWNER=&SERVER_NAME=ryan.kiisfm.com&SITE_ID=3108&STATION_ID=RYAN-IP&TRACK= |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525212706/http://ryan.kiisfm.com/cc-common/mediaplayer/player.html?redir=yes&mps=kiisfm.php&mid=http://a1135.g.akamai.net/f/1135/18227/1h/cchannel.download.akamai.com/18227/podcast/LOSANGELES-CA/KIIS-FM/MILEYCYRUS062508.mp3%3FCPROG=PCAST&CPROG=RICHMEDIA&MARKET=LOSANGELES-CA&NG_FORMAT=personality&NG_ID=RYAN1027IP&OR_NEWSFORMAT=&OWNER=&SERVER_NAME=ryan.kiisfm.com&SITE_ID=3108&STATION_ID=RYAN-IP&TRACK= |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 25, 2012 |title=On Air with Ryan Seacrest |work=[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]] |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |first=Miley |last=Cyrus |subjectlink=Miley Cyrus |others=[[Ryan Seacrest]] }}</ref>\n{{quote|\"I was locked up in the bus the entire time.

The song was co-written by Cyrus, [[Antonina Armato]] and [[Tim James (music producer)|Tim James]], and produced by [[John Fields (producer)|John Fields]]. It was released on June 17, 2008 by [[Hollywood Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the first [[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|studio album]] released by Cyrus with no ties to her character [[List of Hannah Montana main characters|Hannah Montana]] from the [[Disney Channel]] comedy series [[Hannah Montana|of the same name]]. Also registered as \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", Cyrus developed the song during the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]] while feeling numerous emotions for an ex-boyfriend, mainly anger. The song's release brought allegations that it was about [[Nick Jonas]] of the [[Jonas Brothers]], which Cyrus neither confirmed nor denied. Musically, \"7 Things\" bears aspects of both [[country music|country]] and [[pop punk]], while the lyrics in the song's refrain list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend.\n\n\"7 Things\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics and enjoyed worldwide commercial success, becoming a top ten hit on charts in Australia, Japan, Norway, and the United States. The single was [[Music recording sales certifications|certified gold]] by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), while its appearance on the [[Japan Hot 100]] made \"7 Things\" Cyrus' first song to chart in an Asian country. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Brett Ratner]] and features Cyrus performing the song with a back-up band as many teenage girls lipsync along. The girls clutch a variety of props, such as [[love letter]]s and [[snow globe]]s, inspired by personal items Cyrus' ex had given her. The video was nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award]] at both the 2008 and 2009 award shows.
