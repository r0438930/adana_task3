reported that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a [[B&Q]] store in [[Dartford]], Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received \u00a380 fines.<ref>{{cite news | title = Footballers fined over shop theft | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6278897.stm | accessdate= 19 January 2007 | work=BBC News | date= 19 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070121172240/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6278897.stm| archivedate= 21 January 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Johnson described the incident as \"comical\" because it was a misunderstanding<ref name=\"Johnson on the truth behind his bad-boy image\">{{cite news\n| title = Johnson on the truth behind his bad-boy image\n| url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/21/glen-johnson-daniel-taylor-interview-portsmouth\n| newspaper = The Guardian\n| date = 21 March 2009\n| accessdate = 20 December 2011}}</ref> \u2014 \"Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B&Q and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was \u00a32.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on [[CCTV]]. We just burst out laughing. Where's [[Jeremy Beadle]] then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the \u00a32.35?'\" He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty\".<ref name=\"Johnson on the truth behind his bad-boy image\"/>\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n{|
