Due to the poor quality of radio parts Mr. Kikuchi had to deal with, he decided to start his private radio part manufacturer facility in December 1944 in Yoyogi, Tokyo. He picked transformers as his initial product line. Kikuchi's thought was \"Even with higher prices, let's make the higher quality of products.\"<ref>[http://www.tube-amps.net/Sansui_Early_History.htm tube-amps.net 2015-01-02, Sansui in Early Days], retrieved 2020-04-23.</ref> By the 1960s Sansui had developed a reputation for making serious audio components. They were sold in foreign markets through that and the next decade. Sansui's amplifiers and tuners from the 1960s and 1970s remain in demand by audio enthusiasts<ref name=audiocircuit/>\n\nIn 1971, Sansui introduced the Quadphonic Synthesizer QS-1, which could make simulated four channel stereo from two channel sources. Sansui developed the [[QS Regular Matrix]] system, which made it possible to transmit four channel [[Quadraphonic]] sound from a standard LP. The channel separation was only 3&nbsp;dB, but because of the human way of hearing it sounded relatively good. In 1973, Sansui introduced the more advanced QS Vario Matrix decoder with 20&nbsp;dB separation. Unfortunately the [[Stereo Quadraphonic|SQ]] system developed by  Columbia/[[CBS]] was the most popular matrix system. But later QS decoders could also play SQ records. Some Sansui receivers could also play the most advanced four channel system - [[Compatible Discrete 4|CD-4]] (or Quadradisc) by Japanese [[JVC]] and American [[RCA]]. Most big record companies used either SQ or CD-4, but [[Decca Records|Decca]] used the Sansui QS system.\n\nIn 1974 Kosaku Kikuchi resigned, vice-president Kenzo Fujiwara became president.<ref>[https://books.google.de/books?id=swcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=Leben+Kosaku+Kikuchi++Sansui&source=bl&ots=Zr3rwstVZh&sig=ACfU3U0SskFJn4kiLWlRHNRQhFn20yMhbA&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwic14SiuffoAhUB36QKHTXKAz8Q6AEwEnoECAwQQQ#v=onepage&q=Leben%20Kosaku%20Kikuchi%20%20Sansui&f=false Billboard 1974-10-26, page 4; at Google Books], retrieved 2020-04-22.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1970s, the iconic matte-black-faced AU-series amplifiers were released. The first-generation '07' models included the dual-mono power supply AU-517 and AU-717, and the second generation featured the updated AU-719, 819 and 919. The separate pre-amp/power-amp CA-F1/BA-F1 topped the model range along with the AU-X1 integrated amplifier.\n\nIn the UK around 1982, the Sansui AU-D101 amplifier and its more powerful sibling the AU-D33,<ref>Bigger version AU-D55, https://audio-database.com/SANSUI/amp/au-d55f-e.html , retrieved 2020-04-22.</ref> were highly acclaimed by audiophiles{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and were so well matched{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} to a pair of [[KEF]] Coda III speakers that they could be bought as a set from some outlets.<ref name=audiocircuit/> These amplifiers used a complex [[Feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] servo system which resulted in very low 2nd order [[harmonic]] [[distortion]].  Despite this success, Sansui completely failed to follow up with further mass market [[audiophile]] components.<ref name=audiocircuit/>\n\nAs the mid-1980s arrived, sales were lost to competitors ([[Sony]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]]'s [[Technics (brand)|Technics]]).<ref name=audiocircuit/> Sansui began to lose visibility in the [[United States]] around 1988, and then focused on manufacturing high-end components in Japan.<ref name=audiocircuit/> The company began to manufacture high-end television sets and other video equipment, but ceased exportation.

The current manufacturer of the rebranded sets is [[Orion Electric]], based in [[Osaka]] and [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]], Japan. Its U.S. subsidiary markets products under the Sansui brand, among others. Sansui is thus a mere [[umbrella brand]] at present. This radical change in Sansui's corporate identity has resulted in a notable change in its product quality as consumers now tend to consider Sansui a mass-market brand rather than a maker of high-end electronics.<ref>[http://www.sansui.us/Issues_IntvsDomestic.htm sansui.us 2006-01-24, International v.s.
