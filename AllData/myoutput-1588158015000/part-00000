Two extensions have been constructed, and there are plans for further extensions through to 2025.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe average daily flow is approximately 0.3&nbsp;[[gigalitre]]s (0.3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres), out of a London average day demand of approximately 2.0 gigalitres  (2.0&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2613.htm|title=Our business|publisher=[[Thames Water]]|date=|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thamestunnelconsultation.co.uk/2012/11/30/sustainable-drainage-and-the-%E2%80%98supersewer%E2%80%99/|title=Sustainable drainage and the Supersewer|first=Richard |last=Aylard|date=November 2012|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> The main currently comprises a major loop linking the [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]], [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]] and [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton]] WTWs clustered on the Thames upstream of [[Teddington Lock|Teddington Weir]] to central London by a southern branch via [[Brixton]] and northern branch via [[Kew]], and a separate unconnected length from [[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills WTW]] to [[Stoke Newington]].  The main is well below most water mains, at a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|65|m|abbr=on}} below ground level and approximately {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} below sea-level.  It is connected to water supply zones by some 20 shafts that extend from the main to ground level.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Driver==\nThe main serves as a partial alternative transfer system to existing trunk mains suffering increasing frequencies and severities of leaks and bursts.  Some of the oldest operational pressure mains in the world (the oldest dates from 1838), the high-level trunks have weakened with steady corrosion, and there has been both an increased carrying requirement resulting from increasing water demand, and increasing external stresses resulting from higher vehicle weights and frequencies.  This has been exacerbated by limited system redundancies which has restricted preventative refurbishment.  The main has both extended the operational life of the high-level trunks by reducing the flow demands placed on them, and, by providing a high degree of redundancy, enabling key trunks to be isolated and maintained.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Hydraulics==\nFlow through the main is by gravity under the [[Hydraulic head|driving head]] of the service reservoirs at the source WTWs.  By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the hydraulic grade line rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the pump-out shafts.  In some respects, therefore, the main can be considered as a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required.  An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the [[Battersea]] and Park Lane pump-out shafts.  The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Construction==\nThe main was constructed in two phases: the southern leg from Ashford Common WTW to Barrow Hill Shaft in 1988 to 1991, and the northern leg between the same locations in 1991 to 1993.  Each phase was divided into a number of 'stages' that were separately contracted and constructed largely simultaneously. The different contractors involved in each stage is to some degree reflected in the variation in tunnelling and tunnel construction techniques used.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Geology==\nThe main lies mostly within [[London Clay]] with sections within the overlying alluvium and underlying [[Lambeth Group]] and [[Thanet_Formation|Thanet Sand]]. The predominance of the London Clay lengths is by design, as being easily excavated, largely impermeable and somewhat self-supporting for short periods it is a near-ideal tunnelling material. Where the hydraulics have required entry into the Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand, tunnelling was considerably more difficult. In particular, the Thanet Sand requires a high boring torque, is highly abrasive and, most challengingly, sufficiently permeable to contain a water table continuous with the underlying Chalk and measured at pressures up to {{convert|4|bar|abbr=on}}. An unexpected entry into the Thanet Sand while excavating near [[Tooting Commons|Tooting Bec Common]] led to the flooding of the tunnel and the temporary abandonment of a [[Tunnel boring machine|Tunnel Boring Machine]] (TBM). A further consideration of Thanet Sand is the presence of [[glauconite]], which oxidises on contact with air. The resulting de-oxygenated air resulted in two fatalities during the excavation of a pump-out shaft.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Future==\nThe main will be extended in stages over the coming decades. Work is currently under way to bridge the gap between the main loop at New River Head and the isolated segment at Stoke Newington and to extend a branch from the Brixton Shaft to Honor Oak reservoir. Both these projects are being assessed for their environmental sustainability through [[CEEQUAL]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Shafts==\nThe 21 shafts connecting the main to the surface are divided into:\n* 5 [[water treatment]] works (WTW), which supply clean water,\n* 11 [[pumping station]]s (PS), which withdraw water from the main,\n* 3 access shafts, where no water transfer occurs, and\n* 2 storage locations, where water is supplied or withdrawn as demand fluctuates.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===North leg===\n*[[Ashford Common]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton Park]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Mogden]], [[Isleworth]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Kew]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Barnes, London|Barnes]] \u2014 balancing storage\n*[[Holland Park|Holland Park Avenue]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Primrose Hill|Barrow Hill, Primrose Hill]] \u2014 PS\n\n===South leg===\n*Ashford Common \u2014 WTW\n*[[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Hampton, London|Hampton]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Surbiton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Hogsmill]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Raynes Park]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Streatham]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Brixton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Battersea]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] \u2014 PS\n*Barrow Hill \u2014 PS\n\n===North extension===\n*Barrow Hill \u2014 PS\n*[[New River Head]] \u2014 PS<br>''under construction''\n*[[Stoke Newington]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills]] \u2014 WTW\n\n===South extension===\n*Brixton \u2014 PS<br>''under construction''\n*[[Honor Oak]] \u2014 underground storage\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book |year=1994 |title=Thames Water Ring Main |work=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers |volume=102 |issue=special issue 2 |location=London |publisher=Telford |isbn= 0-7277-2003-1}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2599.htm |date=July 2007  |title=London Ring Main extensions commence |publisher=[[Thames Water|Thames Water Utilities]]}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=type&id=113114 |title=Thames Water Tunnels |publisher=[[Mott Macdonald]] |postscript=, contractor for the current extensions}}\n* {{cite journal |url=https://www.e-sciencecentral.org/articles/Figure.php?xn=eer/eer-18-2-57-2&id=f10-eer-18-2-57-2&mode=export |title=(a) Thames Water Ring Main: existing tunnels and tunnels under construction and (b) the 21 shafts connecting the ring main to the surface. |publisher= Environmental Engineering Research 2013; 18(2): 57-63. |postscript=, Map and diagram of the ring main.
