But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in [[Barbados]]; 300,000 in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], both British colonies; and 450,000 in French [[Saint-Domingue]], which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.<ref name=\"drimmer\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160705125708/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1919107?seq=1 Melvin Drimmer, \"Reviewed Work: ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'' by Herbert S.

Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 [[Battle of Havana (1762)|a British expedition]] of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from [[Portsmouth]] to capture Cuba. The British arrived on 6 June, and by August had Havana under [[siege]].<ref name=\"Siege\">Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom (2nd edition)''. Chapter One.</ref> When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, [[George Pocock]] and the Commander of the Land Forces [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|George Keppel]], the 3rd [[Earl of Albemarle]], entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. They imported food, horses and other goods into the city, as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the underdeveloped sugar plantations.<ref name=\"Siege\"/>\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|The [[British expedition against Cuba|British invasion and occupation of Havana]] in 1762]]\n\nThough Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants, fearing a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Britain seized Havana, it signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Florida]] in exchange for Cuba. The French had recommended this to Spain, advising that declining to give up Florida could result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.<ref name=\"Siege\"/> Many in Britain were disappointed, believing that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's other gains in the war]].\n\nThe real engine for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the [[Haitian Revolution]]. When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba, too, and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing \"pearl of the Antilles\" that Haiti had been before the revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution|last = Ferrer|first = Ada|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107029422|location = New York|pages = 5}}</ref> As the historian Ada Ferrer has written, \"At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba.

It lies between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19\u00b0]] and [[24th parallel north|24\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[74th meridian west|74\u00b0]] and [[85th meridian west|85\u00b0W]]. The United States lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) across the [[Straits of Florida]] to the north and northwest (to the closest tip of [[Key West, Florida]]), and [[the Bahamas]] 21&nbsp;km (13&nbsp;mi) to the north. [[Mexico]] lies 210 kilometers (130 miles) across the [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] to the west (to the closest tip of [[Cabo Catoche]] in the State of [[Quintana Roo]]).\n\n[[Haiti]] is 77&nbsp;km (48&nbsp;mi) to the east, [[Jamaica]] (140&nbsp;km/87&nbsp;mi) and the [[Cayman Islands]] to the south. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the [[Colorados Archipelago]] on the northwestern coast, the [[Sabana-Camag\u00fcey Archipelago]] on the north-central Atlantic coast, the [[Jardines de la Reina]] on the south-central coast and the [[Canarreos Archipelago]] on the southwestern coast.\n\n[[File:Sierra Maestra panorama1.jpg|thumb|[[Sierra Maestra]] ]] \nThe main island, named Cuba, is {{convert|1250|km|abbr=on}} long, constituting most of the nation's land area ({{convert|104556|km2|abbr=on|0}}) and is the largest island in the [[Caribbean]] and [[List of islands by area|17th-largest island]] in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is [[Pico Turquino]] ({{convert|1974|m|abbr=on}}).\n\nThe second-largest island is [[Isla de la Juventud]] (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of {{convert|2200|km2|abbr=on|0}}.

The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of [[Hong Kong]], which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|1}} in January and {{convert|27|\u00b0C|1}} in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] combine to make the country prone to frequent [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]].

Rumba (\"de caj\u00f3n o de solar\") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Hispanic elements of style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robin|title=Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and Artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920\u20131940|year=1997|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-5645-7}}</ref> The [[Tres (musical instrument)|Tres]] was invented in Cuba from Hispanic cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute). Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, [[Neo-Ta\u00edno nations|Ta\u00edno]] origin, or both, such as the [[maraca]]s, [[g\u00fciro]], [[mar\u00edmbula]] and various wooden drums including the [[mayohuac\u00e1n]].\n\nPopular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Havana was the heart of the [[rap]] scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s.\n\nDuring that time, [[reggaet\u00f3n]] grew in popularity. In 2011, the Cuban state denounced reggaeton as degenerate, directed reduced \"low-profile\" airplay of the genre (but did not ban it entirely) and banned the megahit ''Chupi Chupi'' by [[Osmani Garc\u00eda]], characterizing its description of sex as \"the sort which a prostitute would carry out.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Victor Kaonga, Malawi |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/07/cuba-reggaeton-hit-chupi-chupi-denounced-by-authorities/ |title=Cuba: Reggaeton Hit 'Chupi Chupi' Denounced by Authorities |publisher=Global Voices |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> In December 2012, the Cuban government officially banned sexually explicit reggaeton songs and music videos from radio and television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Shetler |url=http://popcrush.com/cuban-government-censor-reggaeton-sexually-explicit/ |title=Cuban Government to Censor Reggaeton For Being \"Sexually Explicit\" |publisher=Popcrush.com |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/cuba-bans-reggaeton-sexually-explicit-songs/story?id=17888666 |title=Cuban Government Censors Reggaeton and \"Sexually Explicit\" Songs |publisher=ABC News |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\nAs well as pop, classical and rock are very popular in Cuba.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Cuban cuisine}}\n[[File:Cubanfood.jpg|thumb|A traditional meal of ''ropa vieja'' (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer]]\n[[File:La Havane (1) Tamales pli\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|Cuban-style tamales]]\nCuban cuisine is a fusion of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alvarez|2001}}.</ref> The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.\n\nThe typical meal could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ''[[ropa vieja]]'' (shredded beef), [[Cuban bread]], pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans and rice, referred to as ''[[Moros y Cristianos (food)|moros y cristianos]]'' (or ''moros'' for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant spices.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Cuban literature}}\nCuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as [[Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Z. Tallet]] focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of [[Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Lezama Lima]] have been influential. Romanticist [[Miguel Barnet]], who wrote ''Everyone Dreamed of Cuba'', reflects a more melancholy Cuba.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214100357/http://www.tobias-hauser.de/vortraege/?cmd=en Costa Rica \u2013 Journey into the Tropical Garden of Eden], Tobias Hauser.{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Alejo Carpentier]] was important in the [[Magic realism]] movement. Writers such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]], [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], and more recently [[Da\u00edna Chaviano]], [[Pedro Juan Guti\u00e9rrez]], [[Zo\u00e9 Vald\u00e9s]], [[Guillermo Rosales]] and [[Leonardo Padura]] have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities.\n\n===Dance===\nDance holds a privileged position in Cuban culture. [[Popular dance]] is considered an essential part of life, and [[concert dance]] is supported by the government and includes internationally renowned companies such as the [[Ballet Nacional de Cuba]].<ref name=\"Johnn\">{{cite book | last=John | first=S. | title=Contemporary Dance in Cuba: Tecnica Cubana as Revolutionary Movement | publisher=McFarland & Company | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-7864-9325-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE0KI3h-7UC&pg=PA23 | page=23}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Cuba}}\nDue to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports that are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally played in other Latin American nations. [[Baseball in Cuba|Baseball]] is the most popular. Other sports and pastimes include [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[cricket]], and [[sport of athletics|athletics]].

But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in [[Barbados]]; 300,000 in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], both British colonies; and 450,000 in French [[Saint-Domingue]], which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.<ref name=\"drimmer\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160705125708/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1919107?seq=1 Melvin Drimmer, \"Reviewed Work: ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'' by Herbert S.

Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 [[Battle of Havana (1762)|a British expedition]] of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from [[Portsmouth]] to capture Cuba. The British arrived on 6 June, and by August had Havana under [[siege]].<ref name=\"Siege\">Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom (2nd edition)''. Chapter One.</ref> When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, [[George Pocock]] and the Commander of the Land Forces [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|George Keppel]], the 3rd [[Earl of Albemarle]], entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. They imported food, horses and other goods into the city, as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the underdeveloped sugar plantations.<ref name=\"Siege\"/>\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|The [[British expedition against Cuba|British invasion and occupation of Havana]] in 1762]]\n\nThough Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants, fearing a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Britain seized Havana, it signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Florida]] in exchange for Cuba. The French had recommended this to Spain, advising that declining to give up Florida could result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.<ref name=\"Siege\"/> Many in Britain were disappointed, believing that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's other gains in the war]].\n\nThe real engine for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the [[Haitian Revolution]]. When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba, too, and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing \"pearl of the Antilles\" that Haiti had been before the revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution|last = Ferrer|first = Ada|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107029422|location = New York|pages = 5}}</ref> As the historian Ada Ferrer has written, \"At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba.

The United States lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) across the [[Straits of Florida]] to the north and northwest (to the closest tip of [[Key West, Florida]]), and [[the Bahamas]] 21&nbsp;km (13&nbsp;mi) to the north. [[Mexico]] lies 210 kilometers (130 miles) across the [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] to the west (to the closest tip of [[Cabo Catoche]] in the State of [[Quintana Roo]]).\n\n[[Haiti]] is 77&nbsp;km (48&nbsp;mi) to the east, [[Jamaica]] (140&nbsp;km/87&nbsp;mi) and the [[Cayman Islands]] to the south. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the [[Colorados Archipelago]] on the northwestern coast, the [[Sabana-Camag\u00fcey Archipelago]] on the north-central Atlantic coast, the [[Jardines de la Reina]] on the south-central coast and the [[Canarreos Archipelago]] on the southwestern coast.\n\n[[File:Sierra Maestra panorama1.jpg|thumb|[[Sierra Maestra]] ]] \nThe main island, named Cuba, is {{convert|1250|km|abbr=on}} long, constituting most of the nation's land area ({{convert|104556|km2|abbr=on|0}}) and is the largest island in the [[Caribbean]] and [[List of islands by area|17th-largest island]] in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is [[Pico Turquino]] ({{convert|1974|m|abbr=on}}).\n\nThe second-largest island is [[Isla de la Juventud]] (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of {{convert|2200|km2|abbr=on|0}}.

The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of [[Hong Kong]], which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|1}} in January and {{convert|27|\u00b0C|1}} in July.

Rumba (\"de caj\u00f3n o de solar\") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Hispanic elements of style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robin|title=Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and Artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920\u20131940|year=1997|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-5645-7}}</ref> The [[Tres (musical instrument)|Tres]] was invented in Cuba from Hispanic cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute). Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, [[Neo-Ta\u00edno nations|Ta\u00edno]] origin, or both, such as the [[maraca]]s, [[g\u00fciro]], [[mar\u00edmbula]] and various wooden drums including the [[mayohuac\u00e1n]].\n\nPopular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Havana was the heart of the [[rap]] scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s.\n\nDuring that time, [[reggaet\u00f3n]] grew in popularity. In 2011, the Cuban state denounced reggaeton as degenerate, directed reduced \"low-profile\" airplay of the genre (but did not ban it entirely) and banned the megahit ''Chupi Chupi'' by [[Osmani Garc\u00eda]], characterizing its description of sex as \"the sort which a prostitute would carry out.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Victor Kaonga, Malawi |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/07/cuba-reggaeton-hit-chupi-chupi-denounced-by-authorities/ |title=Cuba: Reggaeton Hit 'Chupi Chupi' Denounced by Authorities |publisher=Global Voices |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> In December 2012, the Cuban government officially banned sexually explicit reggaeton songs and music videos from radio and television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Shetler |url=http://popcrush.com/cuban-government-censor-reggaeton-sexually-explicit/ |title=Cuban Government to Censor Reggaeton For Being \"Sexually Explicit\" |publisher=Popcrush.com |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/cuba-bans-reggaeton-sexually-explicit-songs/story?id=17888666 |title=Cuban Government Censors Reggaeton and \"Sexually Explicit\" Songs |publisher=ABC News |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\nAs well as pop, classical and rock are very popular in Cuba.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Cuban cuisine}}\n[[File:Cubanfood.jpg|thumb|A traditional meal of ''ropa vieja'' (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer]]\n[[File:La Havane (1) Tamales pli\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|Cuban-style tamales]]\nCuban cuisine is a fusion of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alvarez|2001}}.</ref> The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.\n\nThe typical meal could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ''[[ropa vieja]]'' (shredded beef), [[Cuban bread]], pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans and rice, referred to as ''[[Moros y Cristianos (food)|moros y cristianos]]'' (or ''moros'' for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant spices.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Cuban literature}}\nCuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as [[Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Z. Tallet]] focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of [[Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Lezama Lima]] have been influential. Romanticist [[Miguel Barnet]], who wrote ''Everyone Dreamed of Cuba'', reflects a more melancholy Cuba.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214100357/http://www.tobias-hauser.de/vortraege/?cmd=en Costa Rica \u2013 Journey into the Tropical Garden of Eden], Tobias Hauser.{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Alejo Carpentier]] was important in the [[Magic realism]] movement. Writers such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]], [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], and more recently [[Da\u00edna Chaviano]], [[Pedro Juan Guti\u00e9rrez]], [[Zo\u00e9 Vald\u00e9s]], [[Guillermo Rosales]] and [[Leonardo Padura]] have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities.\n\n===Dance===\nDance holds a privileged position in Cuban culture. [[Popular dance]] is considered an essential part of life, and [[concert dance]] is supported by the government and includes internationally renowned companies such as the [[Ballet Nacional de Cuba]].<ref name=\"Johnn\">{{cite book | last=John | first=S. | title=Contemporary Dance in Cuba: Tecnica Cubana as Revolutionary Movement | publisher=McFarland & Company | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-7864-9325-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE0KI3h-7UC&pg=PA23 | page=23}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Cuba}}\nDue to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports that are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally played in other Latin American nations. [[Baseball in Cuba|Baseball]] is the most popular. Other sports and pastimes include [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[cricket]], and [[sport of athletics|athletics]].
