This formula was included in the footnote of the article without any explanation. \nMcDonald (1985)<ref name=M1985/> refers to a formula algebraically equivalent to <math>\\rho_{C}</math> as <math>\\omega</math> in his book. He also says that the <math>\\theta</math> presented by McDonald (1970) is renamed <math>\\omega</math>. \nMcDonald (1999)<ref name=M1999/> describes various types of reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional and multi-dimensional models) as <math>\\omega</math>. He explicitly declares that he first proposed <math>\\rho_{C}</math>. McDonald (1985, 1999)<ref name=M1985/>)<ref name=M1999/> does not cite J\u00f6reskog (1971) or Werts et al. (1974).\n\nThe following objections were made. First, the formula proposed by McDonald (1970) was not new. If this formula were of high academic value at that time, it would not have been presented without explanation in the footnotes. In the context of EFA, there are studies suggesting similar reliability formulas.<ref>Bentler, P. M. (1968). Alpha-maximized factor analysis (alphamax): Its relation to alpha and canonical factor analysis. Psychometrika, 33(3), 335\u2013345. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289328</ref><ref>Heise, D. R., & Bohrnstedt, G. W. (1970). Validity, invalidity, and reliability. Sociological Methodology, 2, 104-129. doi:10.2307/270785.</ref>\nSecond, McDonald (1970) 's <math>\\theta</math> differs from <math>\\rho_{C}</math>. The denominator of the formula given by McDonald (1970) is observed covariances, and the denominator of <math>\\rho_{C}</math> is fitted covariances.\nThird, McDonald (1970) did not discuss how to actually obtain this coefficient. While it is easy to derive a reliability formula, the more important barrier at that time was how to obtain estimates of each parameter. J\u00f6reskog has addressed this issue across studies.<ref>J\u00f6reskog, K. G. (1969). A general approach to confirmatory maximum likelihood factor analysis.

McDonald (1970) was occasionally cited in EFA literature, but rarely cited in reliability literature. The expression coefficients <math>\\omega</math> was rarely used before 2009.\n\n====Logical and practical problems====\nVarious SEM-based reliability coefficients are referred to as <math> \\omega</math>, typically without a definition. Therefore, it is difficult for readers to know exactly what the name <math> \\omega</math> refers to. This practice reduces the accuracy of communication. If we need a generic name to refer to a variety of reliability coefficients, using <math> \\rho</math> rather than <math> \\omega</math> is more traditional.\n====Frequency of use====\nApplied researchers rarely use this name.\nResearchers who publish papers on reliability often use this name recently.<ref>Brunner, M., Nagy, G., & Wilhelm, O.

This formula was included in the footnote of the article without any explanation. \nMcDonald (1985)<ref name=M1985/> refers to a formula algebraically equivalent to <math>\\rho_{C}</math> as <math>\\omega</math> in his book. He also says that the <math>\\theta</math> presented by McDonald (1970) is renamed <math>\\omega</math>. \nMcDonald (1999)<ref name=M1999/> describes various types of reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional and multi-dimensional models) as <math>\\omega</math>. He explicitly declares that he first proposed <math>\\rho_{C}</math>. McDonald (1985, 1999)<ref name=M1985/>)<ref name=M1999/> does not cite J\u00f6reskog (1971) or Werts et al. (1974).\n\nThe following objections were made. First, the formula proposed by McDonald (1970) was not new. If this formula were of high academic value at that time, it would not have been presented without explanation in the footnotes. In the context of EFA, there are studies suggesting similar reliability formulas.<ref>Bentler, P. M. (1968). Alpha-maximized factor analysis (alphamax): Its relation to alpha and canonical factor analysis. Psychometrika, 33(3), 335\u2013345. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289328</ref><ref>Heise, D. R., & Bohrnstedt, G. W. (1970). Validity, invalidity, and reliability. Sociological Methodology, 2, 104-129. doi:10.2307/270785.</ref>\nSecond, McDonald (1970) 's <math>\\theta</math> differs from <math>\\rho_{C}</math>. The denominator of the formula given by McDonald (1970) is observed covariances, and the denominator of <math>\\rho_{C}</math> is fitted covariances.\nThird, McDonald (1970) did not discuss how to actually obtain this coefficient. While it is easy to derive a reliability formula, the more important barrier at that time was how to obtain estimates of each parameter. J\u00f6reskog has addressed this issue across studies.<ref>J\u00f6reskog, K. G. (1969). A general approach to confirmatory maximum likelihood factor analysis.

McDonald (1970) was occasionally cited in EFA literature, but rarely cited in reliability literature. The expression coefficients <math>\\omega</math> was rarely used before 2009.\n\n====Logical and practical problems====\nVarious SEM-based reliability coefficients are referred to as <math> \\omega</math>, typically without a definition. Therefore, it is difficult for readers to know exactly what the name <math> \\omega</math> refers to. This practice reduces the accuracy of communication. If we need a generic name to refer to a variety of reliability coefficients, using <math> \\rho</math> rather than <math> \\omega</math> is more traditional.\n====Frequency of use====\nApplied researchers rarely use this name.\nResearchers who publish papers on reliability often use this name recently.<ref>Brunner, M., Nagy, G., & Wilhelm, O.
