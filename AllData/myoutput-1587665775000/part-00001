Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103816/https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989).

You Pretty Things]]\", going up and down a C to D scale. Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} He also identifies the line \"look out you rock 'n' rollers' as Bowie \"throwing the gauntlet down to existing rockers\" and \"putting a distance between himself and the rock fraternity.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} He further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Pegg notes that Bowie reflects on his inability to achieve success up to that point, being taken down \"a million dead-end streets\" and every time he thought he'd made it \"it seemed the taste was not so sweet.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg identifies the line \"I turned myself to face me\" as mirroring Bowie's encounter with himself in ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Width of a Circle]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} His identification of himself as the 'faker' gives him anxiety, believing that he is \"much too fast\" to be affected by how others' opinion of him. Pegg summarises the lyrics as Bowie \"holding a mirror to his face\" just as he's about to achieve stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}}\n\nThe song has also been interpreted as touting \"Modern Kids as a New Race\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} a theme echoed on the following album track, \"Oh! You Pretty Things\". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s contemporary review of ''Hunky Dory'' considered that \"Changes\" could be \"construed as a young man's attempt to reckon how he'll react when it's his time to be on the maligned side of the generation schism\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone review\">{{cite web |first=John |last=Mendelsohn |title=Hunky Dory |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=6 January 1972 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |access-date=2 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110180003/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |archive-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Changes\" was released on 17 December 1971 as the opening track on Bowie's fourth studio album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Hunky Dory|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1971|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8244}}</ref> It was subsequently released as the first single of the album on 7 January 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2160) with fellow album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" as the B-side;<ref name=\"Single liner notes\" /> it was Bowie's first single released by RCA.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} In France, the B-side was \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", despite the label stating that it was \"Andy Warhol\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=238}} This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US chart debut.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=238}} Upon release, like the album, it flopped commercially, peaking at number 66 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts and failing to chart in the UK.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Despite this, it became English disc jockey [[Tony Blackburn]]'s record of the week.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} It wasn't until the success of Bowie's following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972) that recognition was brought upon ''Hunky Dory'' and \"Changes\", which according to Pegg quickly became a \"turntable favorite\" and \"embedded\" itself into the \"pop-culture psyche\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} Commentators have later argued that \"[[Oh!

and as a single on 7 January 1972. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103816/https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989).

You Pretty Things]]\", going up and down a C to D scale. Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} He also identifies the line \"look out you rock 'n' rollers' as Bowie \"throwing the gauntlet down to existing rockers\" and \"putting a distance between himself and the rock fraternity.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} He further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Pegg notes that Bowie reflects on his inability to achieve success up to that point, being taken down \"a million dead-end streets\" and every time he thought he'd made it \"it seemed the taste was not so sweet.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg identifies the line \"I turned myself to face me\" as mirroring Bowie's encounter with himself in ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Width of a Circle]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} His identification of himself as the 'faker' gives him anxiety, believing that he is \"much too fast\" to be affected by how others' opinion of him.
