From 1896, at the age of 23, he served in the public service as a legal intern at the Prime Minister's Office. From 1911 he was appointed as ministerial adviser in the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]] appointed Skerlecz head of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] crown land in 1913, shortly before [[World War I]].\n\nWhile Croatia-Slavonia was not the site of any battles, Croatian troops, fighting under the Croatian Home Guard took part in the fighting, much of it in neighbouring [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. Skerlecz managed to reconvene the Croatian [[Sabor]] (parliament) in [[Zagreb]] by 1915. The Croats made further demands for local authority, as well as unification of Croatia-Slavonia with [[Dalmatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[Stefan Sarkoti\u0107]], Austria-Hungary's commander in Bosnia and Herzegovina also sought unification of their provinces. However, Austria-Hungary's outdated political system made any shifts between areas under Hungarian or Austrian spheres of influence difficult. Skerlecz could only support the Croatians in acting autonomously. As the war progressed more Croats found the formation of a South Slav state a potentially beneficial possibility.\n\nHe resigned from his post on June 29, 1917 after his friend PM Istv\u00e1n Tisza was ousted from power, leaving the country in no better state than when he had arrived. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was formed the following year. Skerlecz became [[persona non grata]] in Kingdom of Yugoslavia, because he was known as an ardent opponent of the involvement of Croatia in the newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Skerlecz had to move to Hungary. Thereafter he lived in his family villa at [[Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue]]. He died in [[Budapest]] in 1951.\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=59707|title=\u0160krlec, Ivan|encyclopedia=Croatian Encyclopedia|language=hr|accessdate=24 July 2015}}\n\n{{Croatian ban}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skerlecz, Ivan}}\n[[Category:1873 births]]\n[[Category:1951 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Baranya County]]\n[[Category:Hungarian politicians]]\n[[Category:Bans of Croatia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox officeholder\n| name = Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz\n| image = Ivan \u0161krlec lomni\u010dki.jpg\n| imagesize = 200px\n| caption = Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz portraited as Ban\n| office = [[Ban of Croatia|Ban]] of [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]]\n| term_start = 21 July 1913\n| term_end = 29 June 1917\n| deputy = \n| monarch = [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] {{smaller|(until 1916)}}<br>[[Charles I of Austria]]\n| predecessor = [[Slavko Cuvaj]]\n| successor = [[Antun Mihalovi\u0107]]\n| birth_date = {{Birth date|1873|07|20|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Oroszl\u00f3]], [[Austria-Hungary]]\n| death_date = {{Death date and age|1951|01|20|1873|07|20|df=y}}\n| death_place = [[Budapest]], [[People's Republic of Hungary]]\n| restingplace = \n| party = \n| spouse = \n| relations = \n| alma_mater = \n| occupation = Politician\n| profession = \n| religion = \n}}\n\n'''Baron''' '''Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz de Lomnicza''' (often rendered ''Ivan \u0160krlec Lomni\u010dki'' in [[Croatian language|Croatian]]; 20 July 1873 \u2013  12 January 1951) was a Croatian ''[[ban (title)|ban]]'' ([[viceroy]]) between 21 July, 1913, until 29 June, 1917.\n\n\nSkerlecz was born into [[\u0160okci]] origin aristocratic family in [[Oroszl\u00f3]], [[Baranya County]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1873. \n\nThe Skerlecz family had close friendship with the Tisza family, since [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] became prime minister of Hungary.\n\nIvan studied law in P\u00e9cs and Budapest.
