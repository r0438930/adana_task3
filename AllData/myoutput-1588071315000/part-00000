His trademark was his especially thick [[New York accent]], usually delivered from the side of his mouth.  (He would often pronounce ''th'' as ''t'' and would say ''er'' as ''oi'', thus he would pronounce ''earth'' as ''oit''.) In ''[[Decoy (1946 film)|Decoy]]'' (1946), Leonard uses his \"heavy\" persona to create the hard-boiled police detective Joe Portugal.\n\nOn the radio from 1945 to 1955, Leonard played an eccentric racetrack [[tout]] on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' and later in the TV series of the same name. His role was to salute Benny out of the blue in railroad stations, on street corners, or in department stores (\"Hey Bud. C'mere a minute.\"), ask Benny what he was about to do, and then proceed to try to argue him out of his course of action by resorting to inane and irrelevant racing logic. As \"The Tout,\" he never gave out information on horse racing, unless Jack demanded it. One excuse the tout gave was, \"Who knows about horses?\"\n\nLeonard was part of the cast of voice actors on the [[Damon Runyon#Radio|Damon Runyon Theatre]] radio show (1948\u20131949). He was part of the ensemble cast of the [[Martin and Lewis]] radio show.<ref name=\"dunning\">{{cite book| last=Dunning |first=John| title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio| year=1998| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0-199-84045-8| page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/438 438] | url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn| url-access=registration | quote=The Martin And Lewis Show,. | accessdate=2019-08-17}}</ref> He also appeared frequently on ''[[Simon Templar#The Saint on radio|The Adventures of the Saint]]'', often playing gangsters and heavies, but also sometimes in more positive roles. Leonard was also a regular on the radio comedy series ''[[The Adventures of Maisie]]'' in the 1940s. During the 1950s, Leonard provided the voice of lazy fat cat Dodsworth in two [[Warner Bros.]] [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoons directed by [[Robert McKimson]].\n\n[[File:Big eddie 1975.JPG|left|thumb|225px|Leonard, [[Sheree North]] and [[Quinn Cummings]] in ''Big Eddie'', 1975]]\n\nIn the adventure movie ''[[The Iroquois Trail]]'' (1950), Leonard played against type in the significant role of Chief Ogane, a Native American warrior, who pursues and fights the frontiersman Nat \"Hawkeye\" Cutler ([[George Montgomery (actor)|George Montgomery]]) in a climactic duel to the death with knives.\n\nLater in the 1950s and 1960s, he established a reputation as a producer of successful television series, including ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]'' (aka ''[[Make Room For Daddy]]'') (1953\u201364), ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1960\u201368), ''[[Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C.]]'' (1964\u201369), ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (1961\u201366), and ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' (1965\u201368). He also directed several TV series episodes, including four of the first eight episodes of the TV series [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|''Lassie'']] (Season 1, 1954). Leonard also provided the voice of [[Linus the Lionhearted]] in a series of [[Post Foods|Post]] [[Crispy Critters]] cereal TV commercials in 1963-64, which led to a ''Linus'' cartoon series that aired on Saturday (and later, Sunday) mornings on [[CBS]] (1964\u201366) and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (1967\u201369). He also was briefly the star of his own television show ''[[Big Eddie]]'' (1975), where he played the owner of a large sports arena. The show lasted for only ten episodes.\n\nThe character of [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] was introduced in a 1960 episode of ''The Danny Thomas Show'', which led to the series ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''. Leonard is informally credited with developing the practice of using an episode of a series as a [[Backdoor pilots|backdoor pilot]] episode for new series, in which a guest star is introduced as a new character with the intention of using this character as the basis for a new show. He was the executive producer on ''[[Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C.]]'', and had an appearance on the show as a Hollywood producer who has to do 34 takes on a movie scene before Seargent Carter gets it right (\"A  Star is Not Born\").\n\nLeonard also has the distinction (along with author [[Mickey Spillane]]) of being one of the first two Miller Lite spokesmen. Using his trademark accent, he told the audience, \"I was at first reluctant to try Miller Lite, but then I was persuaded to do so by my friend, Large Louis.\"  One of his last acting roles was a guest appearance on the TV series ''[[Cheers]]'', in which he played Sid Nelson, the proprietor of \"The Hungry Heifer,\" [[Norm Peterson]]'s favorite eating establishment.\n\nLeonard died on January 11, 1997, 6 weeks before his 90th birthday.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author= [[Frank Bruni]] |title=Sheldon Leonard, Film Actor And TV Producer, Dies at 89 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/13/movies/sheldon-leonard-film-actor-and-tv-producer-dies-at-89.html |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=January 13, 1997 }}</ref><ref name=Vosburgh>{{cite web|author=[[Dick Vosburgh]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sheldon-leonard-1283571.html|title=Sheldon Leonard  |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=January 17, 1997|accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> He was buried at [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Bill Cosby]], whom Leonard cast in ''I Spy'', described Leonard as \"my last father\" when he dedicated an episode of ''[[Cosby]]'' to both Leonard and his slain son [[Murder of Ennis Cosby|Ennis Cosby]].
