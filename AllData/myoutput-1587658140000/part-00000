VY Ute's received the same upgrades as the sedan/wagon range, which involved a new, sharper-designed nose, and more European-styled interior. The same three specification models were carried over for the VY, and picked up the same upgraded equipment lists as the VY sedans.\nThe VY range marked major change for Holden's Ute range, with the 2003 addition of two new models: the return of the '''One Tonner''' cab-chassis utility after a 18-year hiatus; and the introduction of Holden's first-ever 4-door utility, arriving in the form of the '''Crewman'''. The Crewman brought a longer wheelbase \u2013 {{convert|3206|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|2939|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of the Ute; and a shorter tray \u2013 {{convert|1463|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|2193|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of the Ute<ref>[http://www.holden.com.au/pdf/chooseavehicle/fullfeatures/LCVVZ_SpecFeat.pdf Holden Ute range features] Retrieved 20 October 2007 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In December 2003, Holden released an [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] variant of the Crewman known as the Crewman Cross 8. Powered by a {{Convert|225|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]], the Cross 8 featured a modified appearance, more suited to an off-road vehicle.\n\nBoth the Crewman and One Tonner models added instant sales to the Holden range, sparking rapid expansion of the Holden Ute range, its first major growth spurt since its 1990 re-introduction. Once again the same three specifications were carried over for the VY, with the Ute range available in base '''Ute''', '''S''' & '''SS''' forms. The same did not apply for the One-Tonner cab-chassis range though \u2013 it was available in just two model forms, base and S.\n*'''Base''': Based on Commodore Executive specification.

By December 2003 the Crewman range had expanded to include Holden's very first AWD utility in the form of the Crewman Cross 8. The Cross 8 received bolstered wheelarches, raised ride height as well as additional equipment, with the sole drivetrain being the recently upgraded Gen.3 V8 connected to a 4-speed automatic. V6-powered versions of the One Tonner & Crewman were only available with automatic transmission. The VY's were superseded by the arrival of the VZ range in August 2004\n\n=== VZ ===\n{{Main|Holden VZ Commodore}}\n\n[[File:2006-2007 Holden VZ Ute Thunder SS 01.jpg|thumb|2006\u20132007 Holden VZ Ute Thunder SS]]\n[[File:Holden VZ Crewman S.jpg|thumb|2004\u20132007 Holden VZ Crewman S.]]\n\nThe final series of Holden's VT-generation was the VZ range, launched in August 2004. Holden's main upgrade for the VZ's was the introduction of an all-new [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]], replacing Holden's previous [[Buick V6 engine|Ecotec V6's]] which had been in use since the 1995 launch of the VS Commodore. Whilst the sedan VZ range received both versions of the ''Alloytec'' V6, the ute range received just the lower-capacity ''Alloytec 175'' - it was the standard engine across the entire ute range with a six-speed manual - an upgraded 4-speed automatic was available as an option. Once again the One Tonner & Crewman ranges shared the same specification models, as shown below:\n*'''Base''': Based on Commodore Executive specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\n*'''S''': Based on Commodore SV6 specification.

Available with a 5.7-litre {{Convert|235|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]], or the new {{Convert|260|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} 6.0-litre [[Generation 4 V8 'L98']] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\nCrewman's were once again available in Cross 8 form, whilst the VZ range added the Crewman '''Cross 6''', essentially a V6 version of the Cross 8.\n\nOne-Tonners were available with the following specifications:\n*'''Base''' :Based on Commodore Executive specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto or 5.7-litre {{Convert|235|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\n*'''S''': Based on Commodore SV6 specification minus fog-lights.

Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|195|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual\n\nTo make room in the factory for the upcoming VE Commodore, production of the One Tonner ceased in December 2005.\n\nThe Ute range continued without any updates for the next 18 months, until the January 2006 addition of Holden's new [[GM LS engine#L76|L76 V8's]]. Holden's new V8 range was introduced after its previous [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] failed to meet new [[Euro III]] emission standards introduced in Australia on January 1, 2006. The new [[GM LS engine|Generation 4 V8's]] contained an additional {{Convert|10|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} compared to their predecessors (the ute's had previously received an addition {{Convert|15|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} of power, inline with the VZ Sedan range), but were missing two key features compared to their American counterparts: both [[Active Fuel Management|Displacement on Demand]] and [[variable valve timing]] had been removed. The Alloytec 175 also lost {{Convert|3|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} of power due tweaks made to meet [[Euro III]] standards.'\nThe VZ Utes remained on sale well after the introduction of Holden's next-generation '''VE''' sedans, as did the VZ Wagons. By December of the same year, the Crewman and all AWD variants of the ute were gone from showrooms after Holden ceased production, whilst the curtain was brought down on the One-Tonner range once again after poor sales results. Holden's VZ Utes were superseded by the 8th-generation VE Ute range in September 2007.\n\n== Second generation (2007\u20132017) ==\n[[File:2007-2008 Holden VE Ute Omega 01.jpg|thumb|right|2007\u20132008 Holden VE Ute Omega.]]\n[[File:2008 Holden VE Commodore SS V Ute (rear view).jpg|thumb|right|2007\u20132008 Holden VE Ute SS V.]]\n\n=== VE ===\n{{Main|Holden VE Commodore}}\n\n2007 saw the launch of Holden's eagerly anticipated VE Ute range, unveiled to the media in August, with showroom sales began later in the month. The new generation designated '''VE''', based on the [[Holden Commodore|VE Commodore]] tackles an upward consumer tendency towards using utes as lifestyle vehicles. This further shifts the ute away from the traditional workhorse market.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hagon | first = Toby | date = 2007-08-22 | url = http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/revealed-holden-commodore-ve-ute-20070822-141ti.html | title = Revealed: Holden Commodore VE Ute | work = Drive | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-09-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325180748/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/revealed-holden-commodore-ve-ute-20070822-141ti.html | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n*'''Omega''': The base model, having similar standard features to the Omega sedan but can carry more than the SS-V, SS and SV6.

VY Ute's received the same upgrades as the sedan/wagon range, which involved a new, sharper-designed nose, and more European-styled interior. The same three specification models were carried over for the VY, and picked up the same upgraded equipment lists as the VY sedans.\nThe VY range marked major change for Holden's Ute range, with the 2003 addition of two new models: the return of the '''One Tonner''' cab-chassis utility after a 18-year hiatus; and the introduction of Holden's first-ever 4-door utility, arriving in the form of the '''Crewman'''. The Crewman brought a longer wheelbase \u2013 {{convert|3206|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|2939|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of the Ute; and a shorter tray \u2013 {{convert|1463|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|2193|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of the Ute<ref>[http://www.holden.com.au/pdf/chooseavehicle/fullfeatures/LCVVZ_SpecFeat.pdf Holden Ute range features] Retrieved 20 October 2007 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In December 2003, Holden released an [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] variant of the Crewman known as the Crewman Cross 8. Powered by a {{Convert|225|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]], the Cross 8 featured a modified appearance, more suited to an off-road vehicle.\n\nBoth the Crewman and One Tonner models added instant sales to the Holden range, sparking rapid expansion of the Holden Ute range, its first major growth spurt since its 1990 re-introduction. Once again the same three specifications were carried over for the VY, with the Ute range available in base '''Ute''', '''S''' & '''SS''' forms. The same did not apply for the One-Tonner cab-chassis range though \u2013 it was available in just two model forms, base and S.\n*'''Base''': Based on Commodore Executive specification.

By December 2003 the Crewman range had expanded to include Holden's very first AWD utility in the form of the Crewman Cross 8. The Cross 8 received bolstered wheelarches, raised ride height as well as additional equipment, with the sole drivetrain being the recently upgraded Gen.3 V8 connected to a 4-speed automatic. V6-powered versions of the One Tonner & Crewman were only available with automatic transmission. The VY's were superseded by the arrival of the VZ range in August 2004\n\n=== VZ ===\n{{Main|Holden VZ Commodore}}\n\n[[File:2006-2007 Holden VZ Ute Thunder SS 01.jpg|thumb|2006\u20132007 Holden VZ Ute Thunder SS]]\n[[File:Holden VZ Crewman S.jpg|thumb|2004\u20132007 Holden VZ Crewman S.]]\n\nThe final series of Holden's VT-generation was the VZ range, launched in August 2004. Holden's main upgrade for the VZ's was the introduction of an all-new [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]], replacing Holden's previous [[Buick V6 engine|Ecotec V6's]] which had been in use since the 1995 launch of the VS Commodore. Whilst the sedan VZ range received both versions of the ''Alloytec'' V6, the ute range received just the lower-capacity ''Alloytec 175'' - it was the standard engine across the entire ute range with a six-speed manual - an upgraded 4-speed automatic was available as an option. Once again the One Tonner & Crewman ranges shared the same specification models, as shown below:\n*'''Base''': Based on Commodore Executive specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\n*'''S''': Based on Commodore SV6 specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\nThis model was rebranded as SV6 in August 2006, and the 5-speed auto from the sedan became available for the first time as well as a power increase to {{convert|190|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n*'''SS''': Based on Commodore SS specification (minus side-impact airbags on cab-chassis). Available with a 5.7-litre {{Convert|235|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]], or the new {{Convert|260|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} 6.0-litre [[Generation 4 V8 'L98']] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\nCrewman's were once again available in Cross 8 form, whilst the VZ range added the Crewman '''Cross 6''', essentially a V6 version of the Cross 8.\n\nOne-Tonners were available with the following specifications:\n*'''Base''' :Based on Commodore Executive specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto or 5.7-litre {{Convert|235|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\n*'''S''': Based on Commodore SV6 specification minus fog-lights.

Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|195|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual\n\nTo make room in the factory for the upcoming VE Commodore, production of the One Tonner ceased in December 2005.\n\nThe Ute range continued without any updates for the next 18 months, until the January 2006 addition of Holden's new [[GM LS engine#L76|L76 V8's]]. Holden's new V8 range was introduced after its previous [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] failed to meet new [[Euro III]] emission standards introduced in Australia on January 1, 2006. The new [[GM LS engine|Generation 4 V8's]] contained an additional {{Convert|10|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} compared to their predecessors (the ute's had previously received an addition {{Convert|15|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} of power, inline with the VZ Sedan range), but were missing two key features compared to their American counterparts: both [[Active Fuel Management|Displacement on Demand]] and [[variable valve timing]] had been removed. The Alloytec 175 also lost {{Convert|3|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} of power due tweaks made to meet [[Euro III]] standards.'\nThe VZ Utes remained on sale well after the introduction of Holden's next-generation '''VE''' sedans, as did the VZ Wagons. By December of the same year, the Crewman and all AWD variants of the ute were gone from showrooms after Holden ceased production, whilst the curtain was brought down on the One-Tonner range once again after poor sales results. Holden's VZ Utes were superseded by the 8th-generation VE Ute range in September 2007.\n\n== Second generation (2007\u20132017) ==\n[[File:2007-2008 Holden VE Ute Omega 01.jpg|thumb|right|2007\u20132008 Holden VE Ute Omega.]]\n[[File:2008 Holden VE Commodore SS V Ute (rear view).jpg|thumb|right|2007\u20132008 Holden VE Ute SS V.]]\n\n=== VE ===\n{{Main|Holden VE Commodore}}\n\n2007 saw the launch of Holden's eagerly anticipated VE Ute range, unveiled to the media in August, with showroom sales began later in the month. The new generation designated '''VE''', based on the [[Holden Commodore|VE Commodore]] tackles an upward consumer tendency towards using utes as lifestyle vehicles. This further shifts the ute away from the traditional workhorse market.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hagon | first = Toby | date = 2007-08-22 | url = http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/revealed-holden-commodore-ve-ute-20070822-141ti.html | title = Revealed: Holden Commodore VE Ute | work = Drive | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-09-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325180748/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/revealed-holden-commodore-ve-ute-20070822-141ti.html | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n*'''Omega''': The base model, having similar standard features to the Omega sedan but can carry more than the SS-V, SS and SV6.
