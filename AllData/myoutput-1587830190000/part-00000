The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, and the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode, \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" (which aired between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash''), and a two-issue comic book with characters and concepts unused in the live-action episodes also tied into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". The preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] are a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several others from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying reality. The crossover's events result in the Arrowverse being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]], affecting the entire series.\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014 with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", and the crossover's title was revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. Casting was announced in mid-2019, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. [[Cress Williams]] from the CW series ''Black Lightning'' crossed over with the Arrowverse for the first time, and other actors reprised their roles from DC film and television series. The event was filmed from the end of September to the beginning of November 2019.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" was critically praised for its scope, ambition, and the many cameos; the fate of Oliver Queen had a mixed reception. The crossover was popular, with each episode giving season-high ratings to its corresponding series. A two-episode [[aftershow]], ''Crisis Aftermath'' hosted by [[Kevin Smith]], aired after parts one and three to explore the crossover's events.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect a variety of items;<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> he also retrieves the body of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West-Allen (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the crisis date has moved up to December 2019, and the Flash must die to save billions of people.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse, to learn more about what happens to him.

at in the [[Arrowverse]] in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\" (the [[Arrowverse]] crossover in the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]]),<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer [[Phil Klemmer]] said that the next crossover had \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] said that the producers of all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover\";<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> according to [[Marc Guggenheim]], \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for it.<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title (and premise) as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters of [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said that the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain elements of the upcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> [[The CW]] president [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful that ''Legends of Tomorrow'' (which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications) would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> In May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event spanning late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]] (which had not yet begun airing); the episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Guggenheim said that when they first presented the crossover to the studio and network, the creators stressed that they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\" but \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> About the crossover's comparison to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film, ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim said: \"For [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''&nbsp;... ''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. 'Crisis' is a semicolon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n==={{anchor|Lead-up}}Promotion===\nThe May 2019 season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' contained hints of the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor appearing in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> ''The Flash'' sixth-season showrunner Eric Wallace said that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in the crossover's events. According to Wallace, the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell in season six of ''The Flash'' of villain [[List of The Flash characters|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the season's start to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nMost of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season is a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with their counterparts on ''The Flash'' about the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure that they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said that the season would promote the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" Rovner cited the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]] ([[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother) as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, calling it \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who played the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]], said before the crossover that the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him&nbsp;... You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' contained a [[Post-credits scene|tag scene]] of [[Nash Wells]] accessing a chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" before [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appeared in the crossover's ''Flash'' episode. In the ''Black Lightning'' episode, a red sky covers Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]] and sends her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave wipes them and her Earth out, except for Jefferson (who is teleported to an unknown location).<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series: ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]] (who wrote the original 1985 series) and Guggenheim and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The series reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, and its second issue included material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). About the series, Guggenheim said that its concept \"came pretty early on in the process\" when it was realized that the story's scope would exceed the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics series] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" Its four main characters are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> and the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]].<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic-book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\"; the series felt like a main part of the story:<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted at [[Walmart]] on December 15, 2019; the second issue was released at Walmart on January 19, 2020, and in comic stores the following month.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The series is set during the first part of the crossover's ''Batwoman'' episode.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> Its stories and behind-the-scenes extra content are scheduled to be published in a deluxe hardcover edition on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]], with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing to the story;<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode;<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, based on a concept by Eric Wallace.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to work on the crossover. Guggenheim began, creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". The moments were designed to be modular; they could be moved throughout the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, actor availability, and other factors. They also determined episode order; Guggenheim's initial template had ''Arrow'' as the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' the fifth, \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW requested that ''The Flash'' be the third hour; after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\". ''Batwoman'' was the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Certain characters were considered \"integral\", others would make cameo appearances, depending on actor availability.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" />\n\nWith the large moments determined, the writers separated to write each episode. The group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on its title character's scenes, to ensure consistency.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner [[Caroline Dries]] retained the series' grounded tone because it was \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> Although the crossover is considered \"a five-hour epic\", the title character of each series and characters appropriate in those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]] appearing on ''The Flash'') are highlighted.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episode scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems; since the Arrowverse does not have those, however, the crossover allowed its creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] and Batwoman's relationship was developed, after it was seen at the end of \"Elseworlds\" that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> This version of the Anti-Monitor was inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\nGuggenheim said that the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, opening with a similar destruction of parallel universes.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Wallace said about the deaths of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] in the comic storyline that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\", killing only some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Although it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover (which, Guggenheim felt, \"spoiled our own story\"), his death in the first hour was an attempt to \"surprise [an] audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth; it also \"establish[ed] the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> The third-hour death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\", without killing Gustin's character. According to Wallace, this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Guggenheim said that it was also done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\": \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThe inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover explored the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who played that series' Lois Lane, said: \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" The ''Batwoman'' episode in which the characters appear was written by former ''Smallville'' writers, allowing Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> The removal of this Clark's powers was a reference to ''[[Superman II]]'', where [[Christopher Reeve]]'s Superman temporarily surrenders his powers. Although the details of how ''Smallville'' Clark lost his powers are not explored, \"the idea that Clark would give up his powers in order to have this kind of life, that really resonated with all of\" the writers and [[Tom Welling]]. ''[[Daily Planet]]'' articles written by Lois were shown \"to make it very clear\" to the audience \"that he did become Superman, that he did have all these adventures, but they are left to your imagination.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimSmallvillePowers\" /> The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Three actors who played Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, but no scene contains all three; the writers wanted a clear distinction between Welling's character at the Kent Farm and Routh's character at the ''Daily Planet''. Guggenheim said, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series, ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]: \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene, written by Certo (a ''Lucifer'' fan), was sent to that series' creative team for their feedback; ''Lucifer'' showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, and Ellis contributed his pronunciation of Constantine as \"Constantyne\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\"; he had wanted to participate in the crossover when he learned that it was adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> Black Lightning's inclusion was decided \"very late in the game\", according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to incorporate the character not as a cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". When the logistics and creative elements were resolved, Black Lightning \"elevated the crossover to another level\". Actor [[Cress Williams]] said that the character enters \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people\"; there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the [[Speed Force]] in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it's a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; they wanted to \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|Diggle]]'s fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|''Arrow'' season-six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force in which she helps break up the fight. Since the writers considered season six \"relatively recent\", they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode (one of Guggenheim's favorites) and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". In the Speed Force, Barry encounters [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics chief creative officer [[Jim Lee]] and [[DC Entertainment]] film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure that it would not conflict with their planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe glimpse of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] and the [[Justice Society of America]] on Earth-2 from ''[[Stargirl (TV series)|Stargirl]]'' was not originally intended. ''Stargirl'' creator [[Geoff Johns]] said that production of that series had completed, and Pedowitz advocated its inclusion after seeing footage of the series: \"I was incredibly excited about the opportunity for that because it just meant more people would see it. And [tonally], Stargirl and the show has always been for everybody. Anyone can watch it.

The hints were a \"fun bit\" for the writers to end the crossover, since the Wonder Twins appeared in an early script.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nAlthough early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]], and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising his role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not appear; according to Guggenheim, a newspaper report cited executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had already appeared in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", also appeared in early versions of the crossover. Guggenheim said that he was not included because \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics; although he considered it \"a really important inclusion\", \"for a variety of different reasons\" it did not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett became a regular on all the series, receiving credit in the episodes he appeared in before the crossover to ensure that he would be available for \"Crisis\" and its lead-up.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Casting was announced at the July 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Ellis had \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", saying that \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In mid-September, it was announced that Tom Welling and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane from ''Smallville'';<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance would also reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who played [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', said that he declined Warner Bros. and the producers' offer to reprise the role in \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', also declined an offer to reprise his role in the crossover due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'';<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> however, he appeared in archive footage as [[Hank Hall (Arrowverse Earth-9)|Hank Hall / Hawk]] from ''Titans''.<ref name=\"TitansArchiveFootage\" /> [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] later in the month, and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed as reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAt the beginning of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced as reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]] and playing [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] from the comics; Lyla had used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> That month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> The producers approached [[Nicolas Cage]], who was said would play Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim later regretted mentioning Cage, and tried to refrain from hinting at other actors' involvement because he did not want fans \"blowing up\" their [[Twitter]] feeds with questions about why they did not appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimKryptonCage\" /> At the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl before the release of her [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] series later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" />\n\n[[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role as Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Although production had ended, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" about the idea;<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\nA number of other actors were considered for cameos. There was \"a whole host of reasons why\" certain cameos did not occur, according to Guggenheim. Some actors were busy with other projects; some were uninterested in the crossover, and others requested more money than the budget permitted. [[Cameron Cuffe]], who starred as Seg-El on ''[[Krypton (TV series)|Krypton]]'', was approached to appear as a holographic Kryptonian elder when [[Argo City (Arrowverse)|Argo City]] was evacuated. Although Cuffe said that he \"wanted to make [the cameo] happen\", he had committed to another project.<ref name=\"GuggenheimKryptonCage\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse on the fictional Kent family farm was done at the end of the month;<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> the farmhouse had appeared in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure that his characterization was consistent with the series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Primary filming was completed by November 8, with re-shoots and minor filming finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> When Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' filmed it; the ''Arrow'' crew had already finished the series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors of the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> They were hired for the crossover because their previous experience working in the Arrowverse allowed them (and their directors of photography) to create a unified look. ''Batwoman'', which is normally filmed with a different [[aspect ratio]] from the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for consistency. A number of stunt scenes, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]] and collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> and the score was recorded by an orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated a number of musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into the score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> cues included the 1960s ''Batman'' television-series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nBefore the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners that \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> He described it as not \"so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Guggenheim added that each series would be affected except for ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" and there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> After the crossover, Dries wanted to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounding established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren't yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the rest of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\"; he called the Arrowverse ending a \"game-changer\" which \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover the universe was rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}existing on the new [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]]. A new multiverse was also created, with six Earths.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Although Guggenheim had wanted a single Earth-Prime, the crossover would not have been able to visit the worlds of other DC properties. A compromise was reached in which these properties were returned to different Earths in the multiverse, and the Arrowverse series were combined in a single Earth. The Arrowverse characters are oblivious to the newly-formed multiverse.<ref name=\"NewMultiveseCompromise\" />\n\nGuggenheim said that \"there is an opportunity going forward after 'Crisis' to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter, Sara, returning to the timeline after her change in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor's more-heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after they almost did so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> In ''Batwoman'', Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice;<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> Dries called this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\n[[Boost Mobile]] was a promotional partner for the event,<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> and the first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teasers.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the event's poster was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> A full trailer was released on November 24,<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> followed by additional trailers on December 3 and December 6.<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /><ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWhen the initial trailers were released in November, a logo with the lead character of each series (except Oliver Queen) was also released; Guggenheim said that at that time, legal and financial considerations prevented the inclusion of Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> With the release of the full trailer the following month, Oliver was included in the logo; according to  Guggenheim, this was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\".<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> He had been told that \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", and Amell does not appear in the fifth episode.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the last two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released. Russ Burlingame of Comicbook.com said that the poster was \"a mirror to the first \"Crisis\" poster, but centering on darkness rather than light\"; different taglines were used, and \"the Anti-Monitor standing with his hands raised up and pointed down, whereas The Monitor had stood with his palms up and arms at his sides.\"<ref name=\"ComicbookNewPoster\" /> On January 10, 2020, Amell released a trailer for the event's last two episodes.<ref name=\"FinalTrailer\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began with ''Supergirl'' on December 8, 2019, continuing with ''Batwoman'' on December 9 and ''The Flash'' on December 10. The crossover concluded with ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' on January 14, 2020.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> The December 9, 2019 episode of ''Black Lightning'' tied into the event.<ref

100-percent approval rating, based on 14 reviews of the episode. According to the website's critical consensus, \"TV's biggest crossover manages to tie these different universes together, offering plenty of cameos, dramatic moments, and surprising twists that will shake the Arrowverse forever.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supergirl/s05/e09 |title=Supergirl \u2013 Season 5 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] rated the first hour nine out of ten. Schedeen called the episode \"accessible\" to viewers, and said that it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". He said that the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\" and called the episode \"very critical\" for fans of ''Arrow'', given Oliver's death (although he regretted Barry's small role).<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Grading the episode A\u2013minus, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said that \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare] us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\".<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the episode's opening \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". According to Siede, \"Crisis\" was the first Arrowverse crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover and a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" Noting that the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\", she graded the episode  B-plus.<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode 4.5 out of five stars, Kayti Burt of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\"; the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" About the cast, Burt said: \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific\"; \"one of the best scenes\" was between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Part two of DC's ambitious crossover is just as relentless as the first installment, if even smoother around the edges, masterfully juggling many characters, emotions, and Easter eggs to a satisfying result.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09 |title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09 |title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the [''Flash''] season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\", especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08 |title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01 |title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character and one that justified the decision to resurrect him after his sacrifice in the first part. It also did \"even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show's existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that's not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that's exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" in what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out\" the character.<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what's happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special. The show featured discussions with executive producers Guggenheim, Dries, Rovner, Shimizu, and Wallace; stars Cryer, Garrett, McNamara, and Conroy; and panel guest Dani Fernandez, among others.

[[Arrowverse]] [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] event featuring episodes of the television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' on [[The CW]]. The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, and the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode, \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" (which aired between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash''), and a two-issue comic book with characters and concepts unused in the live-action episodes also tied into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". The preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] are a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several others from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying reality. The crossover's events result in the Arrowverse being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]], affecting the entire series.\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014 with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", and the crossover's title was revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. Casting was announced in mid-2019, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. [[Cress Williams]] from the CW series ''Black Lightning'' crossed over with the Arrowverse for the first time, and other actors reprised their roles from DC film and television series. The event was filmed from the end of September to the beginning of November 2019.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" was critically praised for its scope, ambition, and the many cameos; the fate of Oliver Queen had a mixed reception. The crossover was popular, with each episode giving season-high ratings to its corresponding series. A two-episode [[aftershow]], ''Crisis Aftermath'' hosted by [[Kevin Smith]], aired after parts one and three to explore the crossover's events.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect a variety of items;<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> he also retrieves the body of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West-Allen (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the crisis date has moved up to December 2019, and the Flash must die to save billions of people.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse, to learn more about what happens to him.

at in the [[Arrowverse]] in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\" (the [[Arrowverse]] crossover in the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]]),<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer [[Phil Klemmer]] said that the next crossover had \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] said that the producers of all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover\";<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> according to [[Marc Guggenheim]], \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for it.<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title (and premise) as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters of [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said that the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain elements of the upcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> [[The CW]] president [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful that ''Legends of Tomorrow'' (which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications) would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> In May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event spanning late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]] (which had not yet begun airing); the episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Guggenheim said that when they first presented the crossover to the studio and network, the creators stressed that they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\" but \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> About the crossover's comparison to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film, ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim said: \"For [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''&nbsp;... ''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. 'Crisis' is a semicolon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n==={{anchor|Lead-up}}Promotion===\nThe May 2019 season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' contained hints of the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor appearing in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> ''The Flash'' sixth-season showrunner Eric Wallace said that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in the crossover's events. According to Wallace, the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell in season six of ''The Flash'' of villain [[List of The Flash characters|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the season's start to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nMost of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season is a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with their counterparts on ''The Flash'' about the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure that they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said that the season would promote the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" Rovner cited the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]] ([[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother) as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, calling it \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who played the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]], said before the crossover that the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him&nbsp;... You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' contained a [[Post-credits scene|tag scene]] of [[Nash Wells]] accessing a chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" before [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appeared in the crossover's ''Flash'' episode. In the ''Black Lightning'' episode, a red sky covers Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]] and sends her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave wipes them and her Earth out, except for Jefferson (who is teleported to an unknown location).<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series: ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]] (who wrote the original 1985 series) and Guggenheim and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The series reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, and its second issue included material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). About the series, Guggenheim said that its concept \"came pretty early on in the process\" when it was realized that the story's scope would exceed the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics series] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" Its four main characters are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> and the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]].<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic-book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\"; the series felt like a main part of the story:<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted at [[Walmart]] on December 15, 2019; the second issue was released at Walmart on January 19, 2020, and in comic stores the following month.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The series is set during the first part of the crossover's ''Batwoman'' episode.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> Its stories and behind-the-scenes extra content are scheduled to be published in a deluxe hardcover edition on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]], with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing to the story;<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode;<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, based on a concept by Eric Wallace.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to work on the crossover. Guggenheim began, creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". The moments were designed to be modular; they could be moved throughout the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, actor availability, and other factors. They also determined episode order; Guggenheim's initial template had ''Arrow'' as the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' the fifth, \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW requested that ''The Flash'' be the third hour; after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\". ''Batwoman'' was the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Certain characters were considered \"integral\", others would make cameo appearances, depending on actor availability.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" />\n\nWith the large moments determined, the writers separated to write each episode. The group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on its title character's scenes, to ensure consistency.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner [[Caroline Dries]] retained the series' grounded tone because it was \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> Although the crossover is considered \"a five-hour epic\", the title character of each series and characters appropriate in those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]] appearing on ''The Flash'') are highlighted.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episode scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems; since the Arrowverse does not have those, however, the crossover allowed its creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] and Batwoman's relationship was developed, after it was seen at the end of \"Elseworlds\" that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> This version of the Anti-Monitor was inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\nGuggenheim said that the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, opening with a similar destruction of parallel universes.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Wallace said about the deaths of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] in the comic storyline that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\", killing only some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Although it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover (which, Guggenheim felt, \"spoiled our own story\"), his death in the first hour was an attempt to \"surprise [an] audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth; it also \"establish[ed] the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> The third-hour death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\", without killing Gustin's character. According to Wallace, this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Guggenheim said that it was also done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\": \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThe inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover explored the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who played that series' Lois Lane, said: \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" The ''Batwoman'' episode in which the characters appear was written by former ''Smallville'' writers, allowing Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> The removal of this Clark's powers was a reference to ''[[Superman II]]'', where [[Christopher Reeve]]'s Superman temporarily surrenders his powers. Although the details of how ''Smallville'' Clark lost his powers are not explored, \"the idea that Clark would give up his powers in order to have this kind of life, that really resonated with all of\" the writers and [[Tom Welling]]. ''[[Daily Planet]]'' articles written by Lois were shown \"to make it very clear\" to the audience \"that he did become Superman, that he did have all these adventures, but they are left to your imagination.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimSmallvillePowers\" /> The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Three actors who played Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, but no scene contains all three; the writers wanted a clear distinction between Welling's character at the Kent Farm and Routh's character at the ''Daily Planet''. Guggenheim said, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series, ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]: \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene, written by Certo (a ''Lucifer'' fan), was sent to that series' creative team for their feedback; ''Lucifer'' showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, and Ellis contributed his pronunciation of Constantine as \"Constantyne\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\"; he had wanted to participate in the crossover when he learned that it was adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> Black Lightning's inclusion was decided \"very late in the game\", according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to incorporate the character not as a cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". When the logistics and creative elements were resolved, Black Lightning \"elevated the crossover to another level\". Actor [[Cress Williams]] said that the character enters \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people\"; there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the [[Speed Force]] in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it's a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; they wanted to \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|Diggle]]'s fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|''Arrow'' season-six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force in which she helps break up the fight. Since the writers considered season six \"relatively recent\", they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode (one of Guggenheim's favorites) and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". In the Speed Force, Barry encounters [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics chief creative officer [[Jim Lee]] and [[DC Entertainment]] film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure that it would not conflict with their planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe glimpse of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] and the [[Justice Society of America]] on Earth-2 from ''[[Stargirl (TV series)|Stargirl]]'' was not originally intended. ''Stargirl'' creator [[Geoff Johns]] said that production of that series had completed, and Pedowitz advocated its inclusion after seeing footage of the series: \"I was incredibly excited about the opportunity for that because it just meant more people would see it. And [tonally], Stargirl and the show has always been for everybody. Anyone can watch it.

The hints were a \"fun bit\" for the writers to end the crossover, since the Wonder Twins appeared in an early script.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nAlthough early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]], and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising his role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not appear; according to Guggenheim, a newspaper report cited executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had already appeared in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", also appeared in early versions of the crossover. Guggenheim said that he was not included because \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics; although he considered it \"a really important inclusion\", \"for a variety of different reasons\" it did not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett became a regular on all the series, receiving credit in the episodes he appeared in before the crossover to ensure that he would be available for \"Crisis\" and its lead-up.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Casting was announced at the July 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Ellis had \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", saying that \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In mid-September, it was announced that Tom Welling and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane from ''Smallville'';<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance would also reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who played [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', said that he declined Warner Bros. and the producers' offer to reprise the role in \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', also declined an offer to reprise his role in the crossover due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'';<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> however, he appeared in archive footage as [[Hank Hall (Arrowverse Earth-9)|Hank Hall / Hawk]] from ''Titans''.<ref name=\"TitansArchiveFootage\" /> [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] later in the month, and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed as reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAt the beginning of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced as reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]] and playing [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] from the comics; Lyla had used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> That month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> The producers approached [[Nicolas Cage]], who was said would play Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim later regretted mentioning Cage, and tried to refrain from hinting at other actors' involvement because he did not want fans \"blowing up\" their [[Twitter]] feeds with questions about why they did not appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimKryptonCage\" /> At the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl before the release of her [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] series later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" />\n\n[[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role as Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Although production had ended, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" about the idea;<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\nA number of other actors were considered for cameos. There was \"a whole host of reasons why\" certain cameos did not occur, according to Guggenheim. Some actors were busy with other projects; some were uninterested in the crossover, and others requested more money than the budget permitted. [[Cameron Cuffe]], who starred as Seg-El on ''[[Krypton (TV series)|Krypton]]'', was approached to appear as a holographic Kryptonian elder when [[Argo City (Arrowverse)|Argo City]] was evacuated. Although Cuffe said that he \"wanted to make [the cameo] happen\", he had committed to another project.<ref name=\"GuggenheimKryptonCage\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse on the fictional Kent family farm was done at the end of the month;<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> the farmhouse had appeared in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure that his characterization was consistent with the series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Primary filming was completed by November 8, with re-shoots and minor filming finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> When Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' filmed it; the ''Arrow'' crew had already finished the series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors of the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> They were hired for the crossover because their previous experience working in the Arrowverse allowed them (and their directors of photography) to create a unified look. ''Batwoman'', which is normally filmed with a different [[aspect ratio]] from the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for consistency. A number of stunt scenes, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]] and collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> and the score was recorded by an orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated a number of musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into the score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> cues included the 1960s ''Batman'' television-series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nBefore the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners that \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> He described it as not \"so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Guggenheim added that each series would be affected except for ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" and there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> After the crossover, Dries wanted to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounding established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren't yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the rest of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\"; he called the Arrowverse ending a \"game-changer\" which \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover the universe was rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}existing on the new [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]]. A new multiverse was also created, with six Earths.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Although Guggenheim had wanted a single Earth-Prime, the crossover would not have been able to visit the worlds of other DC properties. A compromise was reached in which these properties were returned to different Earths in the multiverse, and the Arrowverse series were combined in a single Earth. The Arrowverse characters are oblivious to the newly-formed multiverse.<ref name=\"NewMultiveseCompromise\" />\n\nGuggenheim said that \"there is an opportunity going forward after 'Crisis' to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter, Sara, returning to the timeline after her change in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor's more-heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after they almost did so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> In ''Batwoman'', Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice;<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> Dries called this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\n[[Boost Mobile]] was a promotional partner for the event,<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> and the first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teasers.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the event's poster was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> A full trailer was released on November 24,<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> followed by additional trailers on December 3 and December 6.<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /><ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWhen the initial trailers were released in November, a logo with the lead character of each series (except Oliver Queen) was also released; Guggenheim said that at that time, legal and financial considerations prevented the inclusion of Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> With the release of the full trailer the following month, Oliver was included in the logo; according to  Guggenheim, this was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\".<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> He had been told that \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", and Amell does not appear in the fifth episode.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the last two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released. Russ Burlingame of Comicbook.com said that the poster was \"a mirror to the first \"Crisis\" poster, but centering on darkness rather than light\"; different taglines were used, and \"the Anti-Monitor standing with his hands raised up and pointed down, whereas The Monitor had stood with his palms up and arms at his sides.\"<ref name=\"ComicbookNewPoster\" /> On January 10, 2020, Amell released a trailer for the event's last two episodes.<ref name=\"FinalTrailer\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began with ''Supergirl'' on December 8, 2019, continuing with ''Batwoman'' on December 9 and ''The Flash'' on December 10. The crossover concluded with ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' on January 14, 2020.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> The December 9, 2019 episode of ''Black Lightning'' tied into the event.<ref

According to the website's critical consensus, \"TV's biggest crossover manages to tie these different universes together, offering plenty of cameos, dramatic moments, and surprising twists that will shake the Arrowverse forever.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supergirl/s05/e09 |title=Supergirl \u2013 Season 5 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] rated the first hour nine out of ten. Schedeen called the episode \"accessible\" to viewers, and said that it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". He said that the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\" and called the episode \"very critical\" for fans of ''Arrow'', given Oliver's death (although he regretted Barry's small role).<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Grading the episode A\u2013minus, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said that \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare] us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\".<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the episode's opening \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". According to Siede, \"Crisis\" was the first Arrowverse crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover and a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" Noting that the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\", she graded the episode  B-plus.<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode 4.5 out of five stars, Kayti Burt of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\"; the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" About the cast, Burt said: \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific\"; \"one of the best scenes\" was between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Part two of DC's ambitious crossover is just as relentless as the first installment, if even smoother around the edges, masterfully juggling many characters, emotions, and Easter eggs to a satisfying result.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09 |title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09 |title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the [''Flash''] season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\", especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08 |title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01 |title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character and one that justified the decision to resurrect him after his sacrifice in the first part. It also did \"even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show's existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that's not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that's exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" in what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out\" the character.<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what's happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special. The show featured discussions with executive producers Guggenheim, Dries, Rovner, Shimizu, and Wallace; stars Cryer, Garrett, McNamara, and Conroy; and panel guest Dani Fernandez, among others.
