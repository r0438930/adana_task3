In 1944, it was renamed '''Weir Cook Municipal Airport''', after [[US Army Air Forces]] Col. [[Harvey Weir Cook]] of [[Wilkinson, Indiana]], who became a [[flying ace]] during World War I with seven victories and died flying a [[P-39]] over [[New Caledonia]] in World War II.\n\nSince 1962, the airport has been owned and operated by the [[Indianapolis Airport Authority]] (IAA), an eight-member board with members appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis and other officials from Marion, [[Hendricks County, Indiana|Hendricks]] and [[Hamilton County, Indiana|Hamilton]] counties in central Indiana. In 1976, the board renamed the airport Indianapolis International Airport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn 2008, the board named the new main passenger facility the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal and the new entrance road Col. H. Weir Cook Memorial Drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080718/BUSINESS/80718004 |title=Airport keeps name, but will honor Weir Cook |date=July 18, 2008 |publisher=6 News Indianapolis |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826191910/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080718%2FBUSINESS%2F80718004 |archivedate=August 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1957 to 2008, the passenger terminal was on the east side of the airfield off High School Road. This now-demolished facility was renovated and expanded many times, notably in 1968 (Concourses A & B), 1972 (Concourse D) and 1987 (Concourse C and the attached Parking Garage). This complex, along with the International Arrivals Terminal (opened in 1976) on the north side of the airfield (off Pierson Drive), was replaced by the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal on November 12, 2008. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 82 weekday departures: 24 Eastern, 22 TWA, 15 Delta, 11 American, 9 Lake Central and 1 Ozark. Eastern had a nonstop to Atlanta and one to Birmingham and TWA had two to LaGuardia; no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Louisville and Pittsburgh. (Westward nonstops didn't reach beyond St. Louis until 1967; TWA started a JFK-IND-LAX 707 that year.) The first jets were TWA 880s in 1961. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, USAir (later [[US Airways]]) had a secondary hub in Indianapolis with non-stop jets to the West Coast, East Coast and Florida and turboprop flights to cities around the [[Midwest]]. USAir peaked at 146 daily departures (including its prop affiliates), with 49% of all seats. USAir ended the hub in the late 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Indianapolis was a hub for then locally based [[ATA Airlines]] and its regional affiliate, [[Chicago Express Airlines|Chicago Express]]/[[ATA Connection]]. After that airline entered [[Chapter 11|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] in late 2004, operations at IND were cut, then eliminated in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=ATA Expects to Stop Flights From Its Hometown in January |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/business/02air.html?ref=ataairlines|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 2, 2005}}</ref>\n\nATA's demise gave [[Northwest Airlines]] an opportunity to expand operations, making Indianapolis a focus city with mainline flights to the West Coast, East Coast, and the South. Northwest was later acquired by [[Delta Air Lines]] in late 2008.\n\nIn 1994, [[BAA plc|BAA]] was awarded a 10-year contract to manage the Indianapolis International Airport. The contract was extended three years but was later cut a year short at the request of the BAA. Private management ended on December 31, 2007 and control reverted to IAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/PressRoom/MediaReleases/detail.aspx?art_lKey=55|title=Indianapolis International Airport: Error|accessdate=4 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511215606/http://www.indianapolisairport.com/PressRoom/MediaReleases/detail.aspx?art_lKey=55|archivedate=11 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/icao/en/atb/epm/CaseStudy_USA.pdf|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042000/http://www.icao.int/icao/en/atb/epm/CaseStudy_USA.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1994, United Airlines finished building the Indianapolis Maintenance Center,<ref>{{cite web|title=Facility Facts & Statistics: Indianapolis Maintenance Center|url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/files/contribute/07.16.09IMCFacts.pdf|publisher=Indianapolis Airport Authority|accessdate=December 27, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712021112/http://www.indianapolisairport.com/files/contribute/07.16.09IMCFacts.pdf|archivedate=July 12, 2012}}</ref> at a cost of US$600 million.<ref name=\"inthesetimes.com\">{{cite web |last=Bybee |first=Roger |url=http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/5072/con_air_the_safe_off-shoring_of_airline_repair/ |title=Con Air: The 'Safe' Offshoring of Airline Repair \u2013 Working In These Times |publisher=Inthesetimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011055604/http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/5072/con_air_the_safe_off-shoring_of_airline_repair |archive-date=October 11, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> United later moved their maintenance operations to its sole maintenance hub located at [[San Francisco International Airport]].

Harvey Weir Cook. It has room for 44 domestic gates and 2 international gates (which can also function as domestic gates). Not all gate positions were used upon opening of the facility, to allow for future expansion by the airlines. The two gate concourse structures were built to allow for future expansion on their southwestern ends.\n\nThe new terminal allows international arrivals to go through customs in the main passenger terminal; these passengers used to disembark in a separate building. Passengers arriving at gates A4 and A5 go to the U.S. Customs and Federal Inspection Station on the arrivals level via a dedicated and secured stairway, escalator, or elevator. After clearing customs, they exit into the south end of the main terminal's domestic baggage claim area.\n\nThe A concourse has a Delta [[Sky Club]], the first airline lounge at Indianapolis International Airport since USAir closed its hub. The lounge opened on November 15, 2010.\n\n===Ground transportation===\nEight rental car operations and the Ground Transportation Center (where information about limousine, shuttle bus, hotel courtesy vehicles and other transportation services such as [[IndyGo]] bus service can be obtained) are located on the first floor of the attached parking garage. All pick-ups and drop-offs of rental vehicles also occur here, eliminating the need for shuttling customers to and from individual companies' remote processing facilities.

In 1944, it was renamed '''Weir Cook Municipal Airport''', after [[US Army Air Forces]] Col. [[Harvey Weir Cook]] of [[Wilkinson, Indiana]], who became a [[flying ace]] during World War I with seven victories and died flying a [[P-39]] over [[New Caledonia]] in World War II.\n\nSince 1962, the airport has been owned and operated by the [[Indianapolis Airport Authority]] (IAA), an eight-member board with members appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis and other officials from Marion, [[Hendricks County, Indiana|Hendricks]] and [[Hamilton County, Indiana|Hamilton]] counties in central Indiana. In 1976, the board renamed the airport Indianapolis International Airport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn 2008, the board named the new main passenger facility the Col. H.

This now-demolished facility was renovated and expanded many times, notably in 1968 (Concourses A & B), 1972 (Concourse D) and 1987 (Concourse C and the attached Parking Garage). This complex, along with the International Arrivals Terminal (opened in 1976) on the north side of the airfield (off Pierson Drive), was replaced by the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal on November 12, 2008. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 82 weekday departures: 24 Eastern, 22 TWA, 15 Delta, 11 American, 9 Lake Central and 1 Ozark. Eastern had a nonstop to Atlanta and one to Birmingham and TWA had two to LaGuardia; no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Louisville and Pittsburgh. (Westward nonstops didn't reach beyond St. Louis until 1967; TWA started a JFK-IND-LAX 707 that year.) The first jets were TWA 880s in 1961. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, USAir (later [[US Airways]]) had a secondary hub in Indianapolis with non-stop jets to the West Coast, East Coast and Florida and turboprop flights to cities around the [[Midwest]]. USAir peaked at 146 daily departures (including its prop affiliates), with 49% of all seats. USAir ended the hub in the late 1990s. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Indianapolis was a hub for then locally based [[ATA Airlines]] and its regional affiliate, [[Chicago Express Airlines|Chicago Express]]/[[ATA Connection]]. After that airline entered [[Chapter 11|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] in late 2004, operations at IND were cut, then eliminated in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=ATA Expects to Stop Flights From Its Hometown in January |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/business/02air.html?ref=ataairlines|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 2, 2005}}</ref>\n\nATA's demise gave [[Northwest Airlines]] an opportunity to expand operations, making Indianapolis a focus city with mainline flights to the West Coast, East Coast, and the South. Northwest was later acquired by [[Delta Air Lines]] in late 2008.\n\nIn 1994, [[BAA plc|BAA]] was awarded a 10-year contract to manage the Indianapolis International Airport. The contract was extended three years but was later cut a year short at the request of the BAA.

Harvey Weir Cook. It has room for 44 domestic gates and 2 international gates (which can also function as domestic gates). Not all gate positions were used upon opening of the facility, to allow for future expansion by the airlines. The two gate concourse structures were built to allow for future expansion on their southwestern ends.\n\nThe new terminal allows international arrivals to go through customs in the main passenger terminal; these passengers used to disembark in a separate building. Passengers arriving at gates A4 and A5 go to the U.S. Customs and Federal Inspection Station on the arrivals level via a dedicated and secured stairway, escalator, or elevator. After clearing customs, they exit into the south end of the main terminal's domestic baggage claim area.\n\nThe A concourse has a Delta [[Sky Club]], the first airline lounge at Indianapolis International Airport since USAir closed its hub. The lounge opened on November 15, 2010.\n\n===Ground transportation===\nEight rental car operations and the Ground Transportation Center (where information about limousine, shuttle bus, hotel courtesy vehicles and other transportation services such as [[IndyGo]] bus service can be obtained) are located on the first floor of the attached parking garage. All pick-ups and drop-offs of rental vehicles also occur here, eliminating the need for shuttling customers to and from individual companies' remote processing facilities. The five-floor parking garage covers {{convert|11|acre|ha}} on each of its levels. It features a light-filled center atrium complete with a piece of suspended artwork and contains moving sidewalks to speed pedestrians into and out of the terminal building itself.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indianapolis International Airport \u2013 Community Days brochure, October 11\u201312, 2008|date=August 4, 2008|url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/admin/uploads/224/08.04.08CommunityDays.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110349/http://www.indianapolisairport.com/admin/uploads/224/08.04.08CommunityDays.pdf|archivedate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Based aircraft===\nIn January 2019, there were 41 aircraft based at this airport: 4 single-engine aircraft, 9 multi-engine aircraft, 27 jets, and 1 helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://basedaircraft.com/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f|title=National Based Aircraft Inventory \u2013 Login|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104191132/https://www.basedaircraft.com/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f|archive-date=4 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport destination list | 3rdcoltitle = Refs | 3rdcolunsortable = yes\n<!--DO NOT ADD TERMINAL/CONCOURSE INFORMATION TO THIS TABLE AS IT VIOLATES [[WP:NOTTRAVEL]], SOURCES ADDED PER DISCUSSION AT [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Airports#Proposal_to_Change_Template_Discussion]], PLEASE EXPRESS CONCERNS YOU MAY HAVE AT THIS DISCUSSION, NOT BY CHANGING THIS TABLE!!!-->\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[Air Canada Express]]}} | [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto\u2013Pearson]] | <ref name=\"AirCanadaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight Schedules|url=https://beta.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/book/routes-and-partners/flight-schedules.html?acid=beta%7Credirect%7Caircanada.com%7CNoBar|accessdate=7 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925064718/https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/book/routes-and-partners/flight-schedules.html?acid=beta%7Credirect%7Caircanada.com%7CNoBar|archive-date=25 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] | [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle/Tacoma]] | <ref>{{cite web|title=Flight Timetable|url=https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|accessdate=29 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202123138/https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Allegiant Air]] | [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport|Austin]], [[Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Jacksonville International Airport|Jacksonville (FL)]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]], [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando/Sanford]], [[Punta Gorda Airport (Florida)|Punta Gorda (FL)]], [[Sarasota\u2013Bradenton International Airport|Sarasota]], [[St. Pete\u2013Clearwater International Airport|St. Petersburg/Clearwater]], [[West Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Charleston International Airport|Charleston (SC)]], [[Destin\u2013Fort Walton Beach Airport|Destin/Fort Walton Beach]], [[Myrtle Beach International Airport|Myrtle Beach]], [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|New Orleans]], [[Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport|Savannah]], [[Tucson International Airport|Tucson]] | <ref name=\"AllegiantRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Allegiant Air|url=https://www.allegiantair.com/interactive-routemap|accessdate=22 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717045737/https://www.allegiantair.com/interactive-routemap|archive-date=17 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> \n<!-- -->\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight schedules and notifications|url=https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|accessdate=7 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202010611/https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] | [[Logan International Airport|Boston]] (begins May 7, 2020),<ref>{{cite article|title=American Airlines adds nonstop flight from Indy to Boston|url=https://www.wthr.com/article/american-airlines-adds-nonstop-flight-indy-boston|accessdate=January 14, 2020|publisher=WTHR}}</ref> [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[John F.
