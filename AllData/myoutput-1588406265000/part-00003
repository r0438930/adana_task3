Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other [[asset]]s for another person. One party, for example, a corporate trust company or the trust department of a bank, acts in a fiduciary capacity to another party, who, for example, has entrusted funds to the fiduciary for safekeeping or investment. Likewise, [[financial adviser]]s, [[financial planner]]s, and asset managers, including managers of pension plans, endowments, and other tax-exempt assets, are considered fiduciaries under applicable statutes and laws.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'', Chapter 1 (Thomson West, 2013)</ref>  In a fiduciary relationship, one person, in a position of vulnerability, justifiably vests confidence, [[good faith]], reliance, and trust in another whose aid, advice, or protection is sought in some matter.<ref name=\"156 CLR 41\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1984|litigants=[[Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation]] |parallelcite=(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 41 |date=25 October 1984 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>{{rp|at p. 68}}<ref name=\"186 CLR 71\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|57|1996|litigants=[[Breen v Williams]] (Medical records access case) |courtname=auto |parallelcite=(1996) 186 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 71}}.</ref> In such a relation good conscience requires the fiduciary to act at all times for the sole [[wikt:benefit|benefit]] and interest of the one who trusts.\n\n{{quote|A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for and on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence.|[[Peter Millett, Baron Millett|Lord Millett]]|''[[Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew]]''<ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=Mothew (t/a Stapley & Co) v Bristol & West Building Society |link=Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew |court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=1996 |num=533 |parallelcite= [1998] Ch 1|date=24 July 1996 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>}}\n\n'''Fiduciary duties''' in a financial sense exist to ensure that those who manage other people's money act in their beneficiaries' interests, rather than serving their own interests.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Judicature Acts]] merged the [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] (historically based in England's [[Court of Chancery]]) with the courts of common law, and as a result the concept of fiduciary duty also became applicable in [[common law]] courts.\n\nWhen a fiduciary duty is imposed, equity requires a different, stricter standard of behavior than the comparable [[tortious]] [[duty of care]] in common law. The fiduciary has a duty not to be in a situation where personal interests and fiduciary duty conflict, not to be in a situation where their fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and a duty not to profit from their fiduciary position without knowledge and consent. A fiduciary ideally would not have a [[conflict of interest]]. It has been said that fiduciaries must conduct themselves \"at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd\"<ref name=\"Meinhard v Salmon\">''[[Meinhard v Salmon]]'' (1928) 164 NE 545 at 546.</ref> and that \"[t]he distinguishing or overriding duty of a fiduciary is the obligation of undivided loyalty\".<ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\">{{cite AustLII|FCA|963|2007|litigants=Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited (No. 4) |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[2007] 62 [[Australian Corporations and Securities Reports|ACSR]] 427}}</ref>{{rp|at par. 289}}\n\n==In different jurisdictions==\nDifferent jurisdictions regard fiduciary duties in different lights.

The duty includes a requirement that such persons reasonably inform themselves of alternatives. In doing so, they may rely on employees and other advisers so long as they do so with a critical eye and do not unquestionably accept the information and conclusions provided to them. Under normal circumstances, their actions are accorded the protection of the business judgment rule, which presumes that control persons acted properly, provided that they act on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe duty of loyalty requires control persons to look to the interests of the company and its other owners and not to their personal interests. In general, they cannot use their positions of trust, confidence and inside knowledge to further their own private interests or approve an action that will provide them with a personal benefit (such as continued employment) that does not primarily benefit the company or its other owners.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe duty of good faith requires control persons to exercise care and prudence in making business decisions\u2014that is, the care that a reasonably prudent person in a similar position would use under similar circumstances. Control persons fail to act in good faith, even if their actions are not illegal, when they take actions for improper purposes or, in certain circumstances, when their actions have grossly inequitable results. The duty to act in good faith is an obligation not only to make decisions free from self-interest, but also free of any interest that diverts the control persons from acting in the best interest of the company. The duty to act in good faith may be measured by an individual's particular knowledge and expertise. The higher the level of expertise, the more accountable that person will be (''e.g.'', a finance expert may be held to a more exacting standard than others in accepting a third party valuation).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt one time, courts seemed to view the duty of good faith as an independent obligation. However, more recently, courts have treated the duty of good faith as a component of the duty of loyalty.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/stone-v-ritter|title=Stone v.

A debate exists as to the nature and extent of this duty following a controversial landmark judgment from the Supreme Court of Canada in ''[[BCE Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders]]''. Scholarly literature has defined this as a \"tripartite fiduciary duty\", composed of (1) an overarching duty to the corporation, which contains two component duties \u2014 (2) a duty to protect shareholder interests from harm, and (3) a procedural duty of \"fair treatment\" for relevant stakeholder interests. This tripartite structure encapsulates the duty of directors to act in the \"best interests of the corporation, viewed as a good corporate citizen\".<ref name=\"Rojas 2014 59\u2013128\"/>\n\n==Relationships==\nThe most common circumstance where a fiduciary duty will arise is between a [[trustee]], whether real or juristic, and a [[beneficiary]]. The trustee to whom property is legally committed is the legal\u2014i.e., common law\u2014owner of all such property. The beneficiary, at law, has no legal title to the [[Trust (law)|trust]]; however, the trustee is bound by equity to suppress their own interests and administer the property only for the benefit of the beneficiary. In this way, the beneficiary obtains the [[Use (law)|use]] of property without being its technical owner.\n\nOthers, such as corporate [[Directors' duties|directors]], may be held to a fiduciary duty similar in some respects to that of a trustee. This happens when, for example, the directors of a bank are trustees for the depositors, the directors of a corporation are trustees for the stockholders or a guardian is trustee of their ward's property. A person in a sensitive position sometimes protects themselves from possible conflict of interest charges by setting up a ''[[blind trust]]'', placing their financial affairs in the hands of a fiduciary and giving up all right to know about or intervene in their handling.\n\nThe fiduciary functions of trusts and agencies are commonly performed by a [[trust company]], such as a [[commercial bank]], organized for that purpose. In the United States, the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), an agency of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], is the primary [[Bank regulation|regulator]] of the fiduciary activities of [[federal savings associations]].\n\nWhen a court desires to hold the offending party to a transaction responsible so as to prevent unjust enrichment, the judge can declare that a fiduciary relation exists between the parties, as though the offender were in fact a trustee for the partner.\n\nRelationships which routinely attract by law a fiduciary duty between certain classes of persons include these:\n\n* [[Trustee]]/[[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]];<ref name=\"Keech v Sandford\"/><ref name=\"Boardman v Phipps\">{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Boardman v Phipps]] |court=UKHL |year=1966 |num=2 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[1967] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 46}}.</ref>\n* [[Conservatorship|Conservator]]s and [[legal guardian]]s / [[Ward (law)|ward]]s\n* [[Agent (law)|Agent]]s, attorney in fact usually from written grant of authority by principal, [[broker]]s and [[Factor (agent)|factor]]s / [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]]s;:<ref>{{cite AustLII|VicLawRp|19|1927|litigants=McKenzie v McDonald |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\"/><ref name=\"2012 FCA 1028\">{{cite AustLII|FCA|1028|2012|litigants=Wingecarribee Shire Council v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd (in liq) |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n* [[Buyer agency agreement|Buyer agent]] ([[real estate broker]]) / buyer client\n* Confidential advisor including [[financial adviser]] and [[investment advisor]] / advisee or client;<ref name=\"207 CLR 165\"/><ref name=\"1991 FCA 73\">{{cite AustLII|FCA|73|1991|litigants=Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref name=\"Daly v SSE\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|25|1986|litigants=Daly v The Sydney Stock Exchange Ltd |courtname=auto |parallelcite=(1986) 160 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 371}}.</ref><ref>{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|65|2014|litigants=ABN AMRO Bank NV v Bathurst Regional Council |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n* [[Lawyer]]/client;<ref>''Sims v Craig Bell & Bond'', [1991] 3 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 535, [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] (New Zealand).</ref><ref>''People v.

Let us imagine it is a serious, successful band and that a court would declare that the two members are equal partners in a business. One day, ''X'' takes some demos made cooperatively by the duo to a recording label, where an executive expresses interest. ''X'' pretends it is all his work and receives an exclusive [[contract]] and $50,000. ''Y'' is unaware of the encounter until reading it in the paper the next week.\n\nThis situation represents a conflict of interest and duty. Both ''X ''and ''Y'' hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, ''X'' has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that ''X'' has breached his fiduciary duty. The [[judicial remedy]] here will be that ''X'' holds both the contract and the money in a [[constructive trust]] for the duo. Note, ''X'' will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both ''X'' and ''Y'' will receive a half share in the contract and the money.\n\n==Elements of duty==\nA fiduciary, such as the administrator, [[executor]] or guardian of an estate, may be legally required to file with a probate court or judge a [[surety bond]], called a '''fiduciary bond''' or '''probate bond''', to guarantee faithful performance of his duties.<ref>[http://definitions.uslegal.com/f/fiduciary-bond Fiduciary Bond Law & Legal Definition.] Legal Definitions Legal Terms Dictionary.</ref> One of those duties may be to prepare, generally under oath, an ''inventory'' of the tangible or intangible property of the estate, describing the items or classes of property and usually placing a valuation on them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guertinandguertin.com/choosing_right_fiduciary.php |author=Guertin & Guertin, LLC |title=Choosing the Right Fiduciary}}</ref>\n\nA bank or other fiduciary having legal title to a mortgage may sell fractional shares to investors, thereby creating a ''[[participating mortgage]]''.\n\n== Accountability ==\nA fiduciary will be liable to account if proven to have acquired a profit, benefit or gain from the relationship by one of three means:{{ref|chan2}}\n\n* In circumstances of conflict of duty and interest;<ref name=\"188 CLR 449\"/>\n* In circumstances of conflict of duty to one person and duty to another person;\n* By taking advantage of the fiduciary position.<ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\"/>\n\nTherefore, it is said the fiduciary has a duty not to be in a situation where personal interests and fiduciary duty conflict, a duty not to be in a situation where his fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and not to profit from his fiduciary position without express knowledge and consent. A fiduciary cannot have a [[conflict of interest]].\n\nThe state of Texas in the United States sets out the duties of a fiduciary in its Estates Code, chapter 751, as follows (the bracketed references to TPC refer to the Texas Probate Code superseded by the Estates Code, effective January 1, 2014):\n\n;Sec. 751.101.

The person who made the bribe cannot recover it, since he has committed a [[crime]]. Similarly, the fiduciary, who received the bribe, has committed a crime. Fiduciary duties are an aspect of equity and, in accordance with the equitable principles, or maxims, equity serves those with clean hands. Therefore, the bribe is held on constructive trust for the principal, the only innocent party.\n\nBribes were initially considered not to be held on constructive trust, but were considered to be held as a [[debt]] by the fiduciary to the principal.<ref>''[[Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd#High Court|Lister v Stubbs]]'' (1890) 45 Ch D 1, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] (England and Wales).</ref> This approach has been overruled; the bribe is now classified as a constructive trust.<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants=The Attorney General of Hong Kong v Reid |link=Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid |court=UKPC |year=1993 |num=36 |format=1 |date=1 November 1993 |courtname=auto |juris=New Zealand}}</ref> The change is due to pragmatic reasons, especially in regard to a [[bankrupt]] fiduciary. If a fiduciary takes a bribe and that bribe is considered a debt then if the fiduciary goes bankrupt the debt will be left in his pool of assets to be paid to [[creditors]] and the principal may miss out on recovery because other creditors were more secured. If the bribe is treated as held on a constructive trust then it will remain in the possession of the fiduciary, despite bankruptcy, until such time as the principal recovers it.\n\n=== Avoiding these accountabilities ===\nThe landmark Australian decision ''ASIC v Citigroup'' noted that the \"informed consent\" on behalf of the beneficiary to breaches of either the no-profit and no-conflict rule will allow the fiduciary to get around these rules.<ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\"/><ref name=\"230 CLR 89\"/> Furthermore, it highlighted that a contract may include a clause that allows individuals to avoid all fiduciary obligations within the course of dealings, and thereby continue to make a personal profit or deal with other parties- tasks that may otherwise have been in conflict with what would have been a fiduciary duty had it not been for this clause.<ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\"/> In the Australian case of ''Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd'', however, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed that the sufficiency of disclosure may depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the persons to whom the disclosure must be made.<ref name=\"230 CLR 89\"/>\n\nHowever, in the English case of ''Armitage v Nurse'' an exception was noted to be the fiduciary's obligation of good faith;<ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=Armitage v Nurse |link=Armitage v Nurse |court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=1997 |num=1279 |parallelcite= [1998] Ch 241 at 253-4 per [[Peter Millett, Baron Millett|Millett LJ]] |courtname=auto}}.</ref> liability for breach of fiduciary duty by way of fraud or dishonesty cannot be avoided through an exclusion clause in a contract.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Judicature Acts]] merged the [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] (historically based in England's [[Court of Chancery]]) with the courts of common law, and as a result the concept of fiduciary duty also became applicable in [[common law]] courts.\n\nWhen a fiduciary duty is imposed, equity requires a different, stricter standard of behavior than the comparable [[tortious]] [[duty of care]] in common law. The fiduciary has a duty not to be in a situation where personal interests and fiduciary duty conflict, not to be in a situation where their fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and a duty not to profit from their fiduciary position without knowledge and consent. A fiduciary ideally would not have a [[conflict of interest]]. It has been said that fiduciaries must conduct themselves \"at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd\"<ref name=\"Meinhard v Salmon\">''[[Meinhard v Salmon]]'' (1928) 164 NE 545 at 546.</ref> and that \"[t]he distinguishing or overriding duty of a fiduciary is the obligation of undivided loyalty\".<ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\">{{cite AustLII|FCA|963|2007|litigants=Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited (No. 4) |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[2007] 62 [[Australian Corporations and Securities Reports|ACSR]] 427}}</ref>{{rp|at par. 289}}\n\n==In different jurisdictions==\nDifferent jurisdictions regard fiduciary duties in different lights.

The duty includes a requirement that such persons reasonably inform themselves of alternatives. In doing so, they may rely on employees and other advisers so long as they do so with a critical eye and do not unquestionably accept the information and conclusions provided to them. Under normal circumstances, their actions are accorded the protection of the business judgment rule, which presumes that control persons acted properly, provided that they act on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe duty of loyalty requires control persons to look to the interests of the company and its other owners and not to their personal interests. In general, they cannot use their positions of trust, confidence and inside knowledge to further their own private interests or approve an action that will provide them with a personal benefit (such as continued employment) that does not primarily benefit the company or its other owners.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe duty of good faith requires control persons to exercise care and prudence in making business decisions\u2014that is, the care that a reasonably prudent person in a similar position would use under similar circumstances. Control persons fail to act in good faith, even if their actions are not illegal, when they take actions for improper purposes or, in certain circumstances, when their actions have grossly inequitable results. The duty to act in good faith is an obligation not only to make decisions free from self-interest, but also free of any interest that diverts the control persons from acting in the best interest of the company. The duty to act in good faith may be measured by an individual's particular knowledge and expertise. The higher the level of expertise, the more accountable that person will be (''e.g.'', a finance expert may be held to a more exacting standard than others in accepting a third party valuation).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt one time, courts seemed to view the duty of good faith as an independent obligation. However, more recently, courts have treated the duty of good faith as a component of the duty of loyalty.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/stone-v-ritter|title=Stone v.

A debate exists as to the nature and extent of this duty following a controversial landmark judgment from the Supreme Court of Canada in ''[[BCE Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders]]''. Scholarly literature has defined this as a \"tripartite fiduciary duty\", composed of (1) an overarching duty to the corporation, which contains two component duties \u2014 (2) a duty to protect shareholder interests from harm, and (3) a procedural duty of \"fair treatment\" for relevant stakeholder interests. This tripartite structure encapsulates the duty of directors to act in the \"best interests of the corporation, viewed as a good corporate citizen\".<ref name=\"Rojas 2014 59\u2013128\"/>\n\n==Relationships==\nThe most common circumstance where a fiduciary duty will arise is between a [[trustee]], whether real or juristic, and a [[beneficiary]]. The trustee to whom property is legally committed is the legal\u2014i.e., common law\u2014owner of all such property. The beneficiary, at law, has no legal title to the [[Trust (law)|trust]]; however, the trustee is bound by equity to suppress their own interests and administer the property only for the benefit of the beneficiary. In this way, the beneficiary obtains the [[Use (law)|use]] of property without being its technical owner.\n\nOthers, such as corporate [[Directors' duties|directors]], may be held to a fiduciary duty similar in some respects to that of a trustee. This happens when, for example, the directors of a bank are trustees for the depositors, the directors of a corporation are trustees for the stockholders or a guardian is trustee of their ward's property. A person in a sensitive position sometimes protects themselves from possible conflict of interest charges by setting up a ''[[blind trust]]'', placing their financial affairs in the hands of a fiduciary and giving up all right to know about or intervene in their handling.\n\nThe fiduciary functions of trusts and agencies are commonly performed by a [[trust company]], such as a [[commercial bank]], organized for that purpose. In the United States, the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), an agency of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], is the primary [[Bank regulation|regulator]] of the fiduciary activities of [[federal savings associations]].\n\nWhen a court desires to hold the offending party to a transaction responsible so as to prevent unjust enrichment, the judge can declare that a fiduciary relation exists between the parties, as though the offender were in fact a trustee for the partner.\n\nRelationships which routinely attract by law a fiduciary duty between certain classes of persons include these:\n\n* [[Trustee]]/[[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]];<ref name=\"Keech v Sandford\"/><ref name=\"Boardman v Phipps\">{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Boardman v Phipps]] |court=UKHL |year=1966 |num=2 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[1967] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 46}}.</ref>\n* [[Conservatorship|Conservator]]s and [[legal guardian]]s / [[Ward (law)|ward]]s\n* [[Agent (law)|Agent]]s, attorney in fact usually from written grant of authority by principal, [[broker]]s and [[Factor (agent)|factor]]s / [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]]s;:<ref>{{cite AustLII|VicLawRp|19|1927|litigants=McKenzie v McDonald |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\"/><ref name=\"2012 FCA 1028\">{{cite AustLII|FCA|1028|2012|litigants=Wingecarribee Shire Council v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd (in liq) |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n* [[Buyer agency agreement|Buyer agent]] ([[real estate broker]]) / buyer client\n* Confidential advisor including [[financial adviser]] and [[investment advisor]] / advisee or client;<ref name=\"207 CLR 165\"/><ref name=\"1991 FCA 73\">{{cite AustLII|FCA|73|1991|litigants=Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref name=\"Daly v SSE\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|25|1986|litigants=Daly v The Sydney Stock Exchange Ltd |courtname=auto |parallelcite=(1986) 160 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 371}}.</ref><ref>{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|65|2014|litigants=ABN AMRO Bank NV v Bathurst Regional Council |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n* [[Lawyer]]/client;<ref>''Sims v Craig Bell & Bond'', [1991] 3 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 535, [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] (New Zealand).</ref><ref>''People v.

Let us imagine it is a serious, successful band and that a court would declare that the two members are equal partners in a business. One day, ''X'' takes some demos made cooperatively by the duo to a recording label, where an executive expresses interest. ''X'' pretends it is all his work and receives an exclusive [[contract]] and $50,000. ''Y'' is unaware of the encounter until reading it in the paper the next week.\n\nThis situation represents a conflict of interest and duty. Both ''X ''and ''Y'' hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, ''X'' has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that ''X'' has breached his fiduciary duty. The [[judicial remedy]] here will be that ''X'' holds both the contract and the money in a [[constructive trust]] for the duo. Note, ''X'' will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both ''X'' and ''Y'' will receive a half share in the contract and the money.\n\n==Elements of duty==\nA fiduciary, such as the administrator, [[executor]] or guardian of an estate, may be legally required to file with a probate court or judge a [[surety bond]], called a '''fiduciary bond''' or '''probate bond''', to guarantee faithful performance of his duties.<ref>[http://definitions.uslegal.com/f/fiduciary-bond Fiduciary Bond Law & Legal Definition.] Legal Definitions Legal Terms Dictionary.</ref> One of those duties may be to prepare, generally under oath, an ''inventory'' of the tangible or intangible property of the estate, describing the items or classes of property and usually placing a valuation on them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guertinandguertin.com/choosing_right_fiduciary.php |author=Guertin & Guertin, LLC |title=Choosing the Right Fiduciary}}</ref>\n\nA bank or other fiduciary having legal title to a mortgage may sell fractional shares to investors, thereby creating a ''[[participating mortgage]]''.\n\n== Accountability ==\nA fiduciary will be liable to account if proven to have acquired a profit, benefit or gain from the relationship by one of three means:{{ref|chan2}}\n\n* In circumstances of conflict of duty and interest;<ref name=\"188 CLR 449\"/>\n* In circumstances of conflict of duty to one person and duty to another person;\n* By taking advantage of the fiduciary position.<ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\"/>\n\nTherefore, it is said the fiduciary has a duty not to be in a situation where personal interests and fiduciary duty conflict, a duty not to be in a situation where his fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and not to profit from his fiduciary position without express knowledge and consent. A fiduciary cannot have a [[conflict of interest]].\n\nThe state of Texas in the United States sets out the duties of a fiduciary in its Estates Code, chapter 751, as follows (the bracketed references to TPC refer to the Texas Probate Code superseded by the Estates Code, effective January 1, 2014):\n\n;Sec. 751.101. Fiduciary Duties. [TPC \u00a7489B(a)]\n:An attorney in fact or agent is a fiduciary and has a duty to inform and to account for actions taken under the power of attorney.\n;Sec. 751.102. Duty to Timely Inform Principal. [TPC \u00a7489B(b)]\n:(a) The attorney in fact or agent shall timely inform the principal of each action taken under the power of attorney.\n:(b) Failure of an attorney in fact or agent to timely inform, as to third parties, does not invalidate any action of the attorney in fact or agent.\n;Sec. 751.103. Maintenance of Records. [TPC \u00a7489B(c), (f)]\n:(a) The attorney in fact or agent shall maintain records of each action taken or decision made by the attorney in fact or agent.\n:(b) The attorney in fact or agent shall maintain all records until delivered to the principal, released by the principal, or discharged by a court.\n;Sec. 751.104. Accounting. [TPC \u00a7489B(d), (e)]\n:(a) The principal may demand an accounting by the attorney in fact or agent.\n:(b) Unless otherwise directed by the principal, an accounting under Subsection (a) must include:\n::(1) the property belonging to the principal that has come to the attorney in fact\u2019s or agent\u2019s knowledge or into the attorney in fact\u2019s or agent\u2019s possession;\n::(2) each action taken or decision made by the attorney in fact or agent;\n::(3) a complete account of receipts, disbursements, and other actions of the attorney in fact or agent that includes the source and nature of each receipt, disbursement, or action, with receipts of principal and income shown separately;\n::(4) a listing of all property over which the attorney in fact or agent has exercised control that includes:\n:::(A) an adequate description of each asset; and\n:::(B) the asset\u2019s current value, if the value is known to the attorney in fact or agent;\n::(5) the cash balance on hand and the name and location of the depository at which the cash balance\nis kept;\n::(6) each known liability; and\n::(7) any other information and facts known to the attorney in fact or agent as necessary for a full and definite understanding of the exact condition of the property belonging to the principal.\n:(c) Unless directed otherwise by the principal, the attorney in fact or agent shall also provide to the principal all documentation regarding the principal\u2019s property.\n\n=== Conflict of duties ===\nA fiduciary's duty must not conflict with another fiduciary duty.<ref name=\"Boardman v Phipps\"/><ref name=\"154 CLR 178\"/><ref>{{cite NZLII |litigants=Farrington v Rowe McBride & Partners |court=NZCA |year=1985 |num=21 |parallelcite=[1985] 1 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 83 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> Conflicts between one fiduciary duty and another fiduciary duty arise most often when a [[lawyer]] or an [[Agent (law)|agent]], such as a [[real estate agent]], represent more than one client, and the interests of those clients conflict.<ref name=\"1991 FCA 73\"/> This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the [[plaintiff]] and the [[defendant]] in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the [[logical]] conclusion that a fiduciary cannot make the principal's interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which is not acceptable to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule is really an extension of the conflict of interest and duty rules.\n\n=== No-profit rule ===\nA fiduciary must not profit from the fiduciary position.<ref name=\"Keech v Sandford\"/><ref name=\"Daly v SSE\"/><ref name=\"154 CLR 178\"/><ref name=\"156 CLR 41\"/> This includes any benefits or [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] which, although unrelated to the fiduciary position, came about because of an opportunity that the fiduciary position afforded.<ref name=\"154 CLR 178\"/><ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|8|1975|litigants=Consul Development Pty Ltd v DPC Estates Pty Ltd |courtname=auto |parallelcite=(1975) 132 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 373}}.</ref> It is unnecessary that the principal would have been unable to make the profit; if the fiduciary makes a profit, by virtue of his role as fiduciary for the principal, then the fiduciary must report the profit to the principal.

The person who made the bribe cannot recover it, since he has committed a [[crime]]. Similarly, the fiduciary, who received the bribe, has committed a crime. Fiduciary duties are an aspect of equity and, in accordance with the equitable principles, or maxims, equity serves those with clean hands. Therefore, the bribe is held on constructive trust for the principal, the only innocent party.\n\nBribes were initially considered not to be held on constructive trust, but were considered to be held as a [[debt]] by the fiduciary to the principal.<ref>''[[Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd#High Court|Lister v Stubbs]]'' (1890) 45 Ch D 1, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] (England and Wales).</ref> This approach has been overruled; the bribe is now classified as a constructive trust.<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants=The Attorney General of Hong Kong v Reid |link=Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid |court=UKPC |year=1993 |num=36 |format=1 |date=1 November 1993 |courtname=auto |juris=New Zealand}}</ref> The change is due to pragmatic reasons, especially in regard to a [[bankrupt]] fiduciary. If a fiduciary takes a bribe and that bribe is considered a debt then if the fiduciary goes bankrupt the debt will be left in his pool of assets to be paid to [[creditors]] and the principal may miss out on recovery because other creditors were more secured. If the bribe is treated as held on a constructive trust then it will remain in the possession of the fiduciary, despite bankruptcy, until such time as the principal recovers it.\n\n=== Avoiding these accountabilities ===\nThe landmark Australian decision ''ASIC v Citigroup'' noted that the \"informed consent\" on behalf of the beneficiary to breaches of either the no-profit and no-conflict rule will allow the fiduciary to get around these rules.<ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\"/><ref name=\"230 CLR 89\"/> Furthermore, it highlighted that a contract may include a clause that allows individuals to avoid all fiduciary obligations within the course of dealings, and thereby continue to make a personal profit or deal with other parties- tasks that may otherwise have been in conflict with what would have been a fiduciary duty had it not been for this clause.<ref name=\"ASIC v Citigroup\"/> In the Australian case of ''Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd'', however, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed that the sufficiency of disclosure may depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the persons to whom the disclosure must be made.<ref name=\"230 CLR 89\"/>\n\nHowever, in the English case of ''Armitage v Nurse'' an exception was noted to be the fiduciary's obligation of good faith;<ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=Armitage v Nurse |link=Armitage v Nurse |court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=1997 |num=1279 |parallelcite= [1998] Ch 241 at 253-4 per [[Peter Millett, Baron Millett|Millett LJ]] |courtname=auto}}.</ref> liability for breach of fiduciary duty by way of fraud or dishonesty cannot be avoided through an exclusion clause in a contract.

They are usually distinguished between proprietary remedies, dealing with property, and personal remedies, dealing with pecuniary (monetary) compensation. Where concurrent contractual and fiduciary relationships exist, remedies available to the plaintiff beneficiary is dependent upon the duty of care owed by the defendant and the specific breach of duty allowing for remedy/damages. The courts will clearly distinguish the relationship and determine the nature in which the breach occurred.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|1997|litigants=Hill v Van Erp |courtname=auto |parallelcite=(1997) 188 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 159}}.</ref>\n\n=== Constructive trusts ===\nWhere the unconscionable gain by the fiduciary is in an easily identifiable form, such as the recording contract discussed above, the usual remedy will be the already discussed constructive trust.<ref>{{cite AustLII|litigants=Giumelli v Giumelli|link=|court=HCA|num=10|year=1999|pinpoint=|parallelcite=196 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 101 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nConstructive trusts pop up in many aspects of equity, not just in a remedial sense,<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|78|1985|litigants=Muschinski v Dodds |courtname=auto |parallelcite=160 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 583}}.</ref> but, in this sense, what is meant by a constructive trust is that the court has created and imposed a duty on the fiduciary to hold the money in safekeeping until it can be rightfully transferred to the principal.<ref name=\"154 CLR 178\"/><ref>{{cite WorldLII |court=EngR |year=1810 |num=194 |litigants=Featherstonhaugh v Fenwick |juris=[[Court of Chancery]] (England and Wales)}}.</ref>\n\n=== Account of profits ===\nAn [[account of profits]] is another potential remedy.<ref>{{cite AustLII|litigants=Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd (\"Lettuce Crisper case\")|link=|court=HCA|num=54|year=1993|pinpoint=|parallelcite=(1993) 179 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 101 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> It is usually used where the breach of duty was ongoing or when the gain is hard to identify. The idea of an account of profits is that the fiduciary profited unconscionably by virtue of the fiduciary position, so any profit made should be transferred to the principal. It may sound like a constructive trust at first, but it is not.\n\nAn account of profits is the appropriate remedy when, for example, a senior [[employee]] has taken advantage of his fiduciary position by conducting his own [[company]] on the side and has run up quite a lot of profits over a period of time, profits which he wouldn't have been able to make otherwise. The fiduciary in breach may however receive an allowance for effort and ingenuity expended in making the profit.\n\n=== Compensatory damages ===\n[[Compensatory damages]] are also available.<ref>''[[Nocton v Lord Ashburton]]'' [http://swarb.co.uk/nocton-v-lord-ashburton-hl-1914/ <nowiki>[1914]</nowiki> [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 932] [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (United Kingdom)</ref> Accounts of profits can be hard remedies to establish, therefore, a plaintiff will often seek compensation (damages) instead. Courts of equity initially had no power to award compensatory damages, which traditionally were a remedy at common law, but legislation and case law has changed the situation so compensatory damages may now be awarded for a purely equitable action.\n\n== Fiduciary duty and pension governance ==\nThe Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century Programme, led by the [[United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative]], the [[Principles for Responsible Investment]], and the Generation Foundation, aims to end the debate on whether fiduciary duty is a legitimate barrier to the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in investment practice and decision-making.<ref name=\":1\" /> This followed the 2015 publication of \"Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century\" which concluded that \u201cfailing to consider all long-term investment value drivers, including ESG issues, is a failure of fiduciary duty\".<ref>UNEP FI, the PRI, UNEP Inquiry, & UN Global Compact. {{cite web |url=https://www.unpri.org/download_report/6131 |title=Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century 2015 report}}[[File:15x18-fileicon-pdf.png]] (PDF).</ref> Founded on the realization that there is a general lack of legal clarity globally about the relationship between sustainability and investors\u2019 fiduciary duty, the programme engaged with and interviewed over 400 policymakers and investors to raise awareness of the importance of ESG issues to the fiduciary duties of investors. The programme also published roadmaps which set out recommendations to fully embed the consideration of ESG factors in the fiduciary duties of investors across more than eight capital markets.<ref name=\":1\" /> Drawing upon findings from Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century, the European Commission High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) recommended in its 2018 final report that the EU Commission clarify investor duties to better embrace long-term horizon and sustainability preferences.<ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/180131-sustainable-finance-final-report_en.pdf \"Final Report 2018 by the High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance\"] (PDF). 31 January 2018.</ref>\n\nSome experts have argued that, in the context of pension governance, [[trustee]]s have started to reassert their fiduciary prerogatives more strongly after 2008 \u2013 notably following the heavy losses or reduced returns incurred by many retirement schemes in the wake of the [[Great Recession]] and the progression of [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG and Responsible Investment]] ideas: \"Clearly, there is a mounting demand for CEOs (equity issuers) and governments (sovereign bond issuers) to be more 'accountable' ...
