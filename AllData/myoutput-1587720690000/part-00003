The series is notable for its [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]] gameplay and extensive use of the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar to simulate [[Real time (media)|real passage of time]].\n\nSince its [[Animal Crossing (video game)|initial release]] in 2001, five ''Animal Crossing'' games have been released worldwide, one each for the [[Nintendo 64]]/[[iQue Player]] (enhanced and reissued for the [[GameCube]]), [[Nintendo DS]], [[Wii]], [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo Switch]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/animal-crossing-on-nintendo-switch|title=Animal Crossing on Nintendo Switch: release date, news and features|last=Hood|first=Vic|last2=Gaming|first2=Nick Pino 2019-06-18T17:06:19Z|website=TechRadar|language=en|access-date=July 24, 2019}}</ref> The series has been both critically and commercially successful and has sold over 30 million units worldwide. Three spin-off games have also been released: ''[[Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer]]'' for [[Nintendo 3DS]], ''[[Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival]]'' for [[Wii U]], and ''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'' for mobile devices.\n\n== Common elements ==\n\n=== Characters ===\n{{main|Characters in the Animal Crossing series}}\nWhile the series features various villagers for each title, certain prominent characters return in each series installment. [[Tom Nook]] is a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. He is one of the only residents of the town to follow a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] ethos. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/tom-nook-needs-to-get-with-the-times-1829149177|title=Tom Nook Needs To Get With The Times|last=Jackson|first=Gita|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref> [[Mr. Resetti]] is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems. Due to a new [[autosave]] function, he was \"laid off\" from his job in ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', although he has gotten a new job as the Rescue Service operator. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/17/animal-crossing-new-horizons-autosave-resettis-job/|title=Animal Crossing New Horizons has autosave, so Resetti's out of a job|date=June 17, 2019|website=VG247|access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[K.K.

This was seen by some fans as tacit support for [[music piracy]], although Nintendo denied that it was intended as [[social commentary]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/technology/social-commentary-or-just-a-dogs-opinion.html|title=Social Commentary, or Just a Dog's Opinion?|last=Jr|first=Tom Zeller|date=December 19, 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 18, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Gameplay===\nIn the ''Animal Crossing'' games, the player assumes the role of a human child, aged between 9-13, who moves into a rural village populated with anthropomorphic animals and lives there indefinitely. Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.
