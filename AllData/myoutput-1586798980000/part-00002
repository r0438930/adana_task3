It was seen to be a non-statistical and unscientific report [[Scientific racism|motivated by racism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Takeji Furukawa===\nIn 1927, Takeji Furukawa, a professor at Tokyo Women's Teacher's School, published his paper \"The Study of Temperament Through Blood Type\" in the scholarly journal ''Psychological Research''. The idea quickly took off with the Japanese public despite Furukawa's lack of credentials, and the militarist government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding ideal soldiers.<ref name=\"AP\" /> The study used ten to twenty people for the investigation, thereby failing to meet the statistical requirements for generalizing the results to the wider population.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nOn the other hand, in 1934, Fisher announced the [[chi-squared test]], which is very popular at present, for the first time. Several scholars said that they found statistically significant differences analyzing Japanese work conducted at that time.<ref>e.g. Masao Omura (Nihon University) in \"\u8840\u6db2\u578b\u3068\u6027\u683c Blood Type and Personality\", Terumitsu Maekawa (Asia University) in \"\u8840\u6db2\u578b\u4eba\u9593\u5b66 Blood Type Humanics\" and so on.</ref>\n\nIn another study, Furukawa compared the distribution of blood types among two ethnic groups: the [[Taiwanese aborigines|Formosan]]s in Taiwan and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. His motivation for the study appears to have come from a political incident:<ref name=\"Nakatani\" /> After the Japanese occupation of Taiwan following [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan's invasion of China in 1895]], the inhabitants tenaciously resisted their occupiers. Insurgencies in 1930 and in 1931 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Japanese settlers.<ref name=\"Nakatani\" />\n\nThe purpose of Furukawa's studies was to \"penetrate the essence of the racial traits of the Taiwanese, who recently revolted and behaved so cruelly.\" Based on a finding that 41.2% of Taiwanese samples had type O blood, Furukawa assumed that the Taiwanese rebelliousness was genetic. His reasoning was supported by the fact that among the Ainu, whose temperament was characterized as submissive, only 23.8% had type O. In conclusion, Furukawa suggested that the Japanese should increase intermarriage with the Taiwanese to reduce the number of Taiwanese with type O blood.<ref name = Nakatani>{{cite book | title = Criminals and their Scientists: The History of Criminology in International Perspective (Publications of the German Historical Institute) | first = Peter (Ed.) | last = Becker | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-81012-8 | year = 2006 |author2=Yoji Nakatani | chapter = The Birth of Criminology in Modern Japan | page = 294}}</ref>\n\n===Masahiko Nomi===\n{{Main|Masahiko Nomi}}\nInterest in the theory faded in the 1930s.

Therefore, the blood type explained only 0.3% of the whole differences of these data sets. This result suggests that blood type explained very little of people's personalities. Nawata came to the conclusion that there is actually no relevance of blood type for personality.\n\n===Controversial statistically significant data===\nHowever, some academic researchers have shown several statistically significant data in Japan and Korea. Akira Sakamoto and Kenji Yamazaki, Japanese social psychologists, analyzed 32,347 samples of annual opinion polls from 1978 through 1988.<ref name=\"sakamoto2004\" /><ref name=\"sakamoto1992\" /> These results indicated that Japanese blood-typical stereotypes actually influenced their self-reported personalities\u2014as a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nCosy Muto and Masahiro Nagashima et al. (Nagasaki University) conducted a supplementary survey of Yamazaki and Sakamoto in 2011.<ref name=\"nagashima\" /> They demonstrated that significant and the same difference on personalities between blood-types by using the same database as Samamoto and Yamazaki used. In the 1990s, difference due to blood types was stabilized and variances became smaller. Then in the 2000s, difference was definitely statistically significant, too. However, the [[effect size|effect magnitude]] was extremely small, despite 'significance' in the statistical sense.\n\nAnother Japanese social psychologist, Shigeyuki Yamaoka (Shotoku University), announced results of his questionnaires, which were conducted in 1999 (1,300 subjects)<ref name=\"yamaoka1999\">Shigeyuki Yamaoka (1999), \u8840\u6db2\u578b\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u304c\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u8840\u6db2\u578b\u5dee\u5225\u306e\u7814\u7a76 A Study on Blood Harassment Caused by Blood-typical Stereotypes, Paper presented at the 40th annual convention of the Japanese society of social psychology.

In Japan, penetration rate of blood-typical personality traits were investigated. Yoriko Watanabe, a Japanese psychologist (then Hokkaido University), chose \"well-known\" traits and found most traits were known to no more than half of Japanese (subjects were university students).<ref name=\"watanabey\">Watanabe, Y.

However, there is no study that directly proved the existence of \"self fulfillment\". Therefore, opinions of researchers are varied at present:\n# Whether there is statistical correlation or not;\n# Whether any statistical correlations are superficial, being caused by subjects' self-fulfilling prophecy, or if they are truly caused by the blood type.\n\n=== Blood Type Personality and Five Factor Model ===\nThe [[Five factor model|Five Factor Model]] tests were carried out in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, after the year 2000. These tests were intended to digitize self-ratings of the [[Big Five personality traits|\"big five\" personality traits]].

Insurgencies in 1930 and in 1931 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Japanese settlers.<ref name=\"Nakatani\" />\n\nThe purpose of Furukawa's studies was to \"penetrate the essence of the racial traits of the Taiwanese, who recently revolted and behaved so cruelly.\" Based on a finding that 41.2% of Taiwanese samples had type O blood, Furukawa assumed that the Taiwanese rebelliousness was genetic. His reasoning was supported by the fact that among the Ainu, whose temperament was characterized as submissive, only 23.8% had type O.

Therefore, the blood type explained only 0.3% of the whole differences of these data sets. This result suggests that blood type explained very little of people's personalities. Nawata came to the conclusion that there is actually no relevance of blood type for personality.\n\n===Controversial statistically significant data===\nHowever, some academic researchers have shown several statistically significant data in Japan and Korea. Akira Sakamoto and Kenji Yamazaki, Japanese social psychologists, analyzed 32,347 samples of annual opinion polls from 1978 through 1988.<ref name=\"sakamoto2004\" /><ref name=\"sakamoto1992\" /> These results indicated that Japanese blood-typical stereotypes actually influenced their self-reported personalities\u2014as a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nCosy Muto and Masahiro Nagashima et al. (Nagasaki University) conducted a supplementary survey of Yamazaki and Sakamoto in 2011.<ref name=\"nagashima\" /> They demonstrated that significant and the same difference on personalities between blood-types by using the same database as Samamoto and Yamazaki used. In the 1990s, difference due to blood types was stabilized and variances became smaller. Then in the 2000s, difference was definitely statistically significant, too. However, the [[effect size|effect magnitude]] was extremely small, despite 'significance' in the statistical sense.\n\nAnother Japanese social psychologist, Shigeyuki Yamaoka (Shotoku University), announced results of his questionnaires, which were conducted in 1999 (1,300 subjects)<ref name=\"yamaoka1999\">Shigeyuki Yamaoka (1999), \u8840\u6db2\u578b\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u304c\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u8840\u6db2\u578b\u5dee\u5225\u306e\u7814\u7a76 A Study on Blood Harassment Caused by Blood-typical Stereotypes, Paper presented at the 40th annual convention of the Japanese society of social psychology.

In Japan, penetration rate of blood-typical personality traits were investigated. Yoriko Watanabe, a Japanese psychologist (then Hokkaido University), chose \"well-known\" traits and found most traits were known to no more than half of Japanese (subjects were university students).<ref name=\"watanabey\">Watanabe, Y.

However, there is no study that directly proved the existence of \"self fulfillment\". Therefore, opinions of researchers are varied at present:\n# Whether there is statistical correlation or not;\n# Whether any statistical correlations are superficial, being caused by subjects' self-fulfilling prophecy, or if they are truly caused by the blood type.\n\n=== Blood Type Personality and Five Factor Model ===\nThe [[Five factor model|Five Factor Model]] tests were carried out in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, after the year 2000. These tests were intended to digitize self-ratings of the [[Big Five personality traits|\"big five\" personality traits]]. It was expected that differences in self-reported personalities (a self-fulfilling prophecy) would be detected from the subject who believed blood-typical stereotypes.
