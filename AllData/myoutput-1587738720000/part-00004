War]] on the Greek island of [[Crete]]. It began on the morning of 20 May 1941, when [[Nazi Germany]] began an [[Airborne forces|airborne invasion]] of Crete. [[Hellenic Army|Greek]] and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]], along with Cretan civilians, defended the island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/the-battle-for-crete|title=The Battle for Crete |website=www.nzhistory.net.nz}}</ref> After one day of fighting, the Germans had suffered heavy casualties and the Allied troops were confident that they would defeat the invasion. The next day, through communication failures, Allied tactical hesitation and German offensive operations, [[Maleme Airfield]] in western Crete fell, enabling the Germans to land reinforcements and overwhelm the defensive positions on the north of the island. Allied forces withdrew to the south coast. More than half were evacuated by the British [[Royal Navy]] and the remainder surrendered or joined the [[Cretan resistance]]. The defence of Crete evolved into a costly naval engagement; by the end of the campaign the Royal Navy's eastern Mediterranean strength had been reduced to only two battleships and three cruisers.<ref name=\"Pack 1973 91\">{{harvnb|Pack|1973|p=91}}.</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Crete was the first occasion where ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (German paratroops) were used ''en masse'', the first mainly airborne invasion in military history, the first time the Allies made significant use of intelligence from decrypted German messages from the [[Enigma machine]],<ref name=\"Collier2014\">{{cite book|author=Paul Collier|title=The Second World War (4): The Mediterranean 1940\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWuICwAAQBAJ&pg=PT74|date=6 June 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0990-2|page=74|quote=The first convincing demonstration of this potential in operational conditions came in May 1941, when the entire plan for the German airborne capture of Crete was decrypted two weeks before the invasion took place.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Beevor|first1=Antony|title=Crete: The Battle and the Resistance |date=1992|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0-14-016787-0}}</ref> and the first time [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] encountered mass resistance from a civilian population.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Maloney |first=Shane |title=Bogin, Hopit |work=[[The Monthly]] |date=July 2006 |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/nation-reviewed-shane-maloney-bogin-hopit--242}}</ref> Due to the number of casualties and the belief that airborne forces no longer had the advantage of surprise, [[Adolf Hitler]] became reluctant to authorise further large airborne operations, preferring instead to employ paratroopers as ground troops.<ref name=\"Beevor_p229-230\">{{harvnb|Beevor|1991|pp=229\u2013230}}</ref> In contrast, the Allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers and started to form airborne-assault and [[RAF Regiment|airfield-defence regiments]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Greece}}\nBritish forces had initially garrisoned Crete when the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] [[Greco-Italian War|attacked Greece]] on 28 October 1940,<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1953|p=203}},</ref> enabling the Greek government to employ the [[5th Airmobile Brigade (Greece)|Fifth Cretan Division]] in the mainland campaign.<ref name=\"Beevor 1991 11\">{{harvnb|Beevor|1991|p=11}}</ref> This arrangement suited the British: Crete could provide the Royal Navy with excellent harbours in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], from which it could threaten the Axis south-eastern flank,<ref>{{harvnb|Murfett|2008|p=114}}</ref> and the [[Ploie\u0219ti]] oil fields in [[Romania]] would be within range of British [[bomber]]s based on the island.\n\nThe Italians were repulsed, but the subsequent German invasion of April 1941 ([[Battle of Greece|Operation Marita]]), succeeded in overrunning mainland Greece. At the end of the month, 57,000 Allied troops were evacuated by the Royal Navy.

Equipment was scarce in the Mediterranean and in the backwater of Crete. The British forces had seven commanders in seven months. In early April, airfields at Maleme and Heraklion and the landing strip at [[Rethymno]] on the north coast were ready and another strip at Pediada-Kastelli was nearly finished. After the German invasion of Greece, the role of the Crete garrison changed from the defence of a naval anchorage to preparing to repel an invasion. On 17 April, Group Captain [[George Beamish]] was appointed Senior Air Officer, Crete, taking over from a flight-lieutenant whose duties and instructions had been only vaguely defined. Beamish was ordered to prepare the reception of the [[Bristol Blenheim]] bombers of [[No. 30 Squadron RAF|30]] and [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203]] Squadrons from Egypt and the remaining fighter aircraft from Greece, to cover the evacuation of W Force, which enabled the transfer of {{nowrap|25,000 British}} and Dominion troops to the island, preparatory to their relief by fresh troops from Egypt.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=324\u2013325}}\n\nThe navy tried to deliver {{convert|27,000 |LT|t}} of supplies from {{nowrap|1\u201320 May}} 1941, but ''Luftwaffe'' attacks forced most ships to turn back, and only {{cvt |2,700|LT|t}} were delivered. Only about {{nowrap|3,500 trained}} British and Greek soldiers were on the island, and the defence devolved to the shaken and poorly equipped troops from Greece, assisted by the last fighters of [[No. 33 Squadron RAF|33]], [[No. 80 Squadron RAF|80]] and [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|112]] Squadrons and a squadron of the [[Fleet Air Arm]], once the Blenheims were ordered back to Egypt. In mid-May, the four squadrons had about two dozen aircraft, of which only about twelve were serviceable due to a lack of tools and spares. The unfinished ground at Pediada-Kastelli was blocked with trenches and heaps of soil and all but narrow flight paths were blocked at Heraklion and Rethymno by barrels full of earth. At Maleme, [[Revetment (aircraft)|blast pens]] were built for the aircraft, and barrels full of petrol were kept ready to be ignited by machine-gun fire. Around each ground, a few field guns, anti-aircraft guns, two [[infantry tank]]s and two or three light tanks were sited. The three areas were made into independent sectors, but there were only eight [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|QF 3-inch]] and twenty [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Richards |1974|pp=325\u2013327}}\n\n[[File:Lieutenant General Freyberg gazes over the parapet.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Major-General Freyberg]] (right), Allied Commander at the Battle of Crete]]\nOn 30 April 1941, [[Major-General]] [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Bernard Freyberg]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]] a [[New Zealand Army]] officer, was appointed commander of the Allied forces on Crete (Creforce).{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|1956|p=126}} By May, the Greek forces consisted of approximately {{nowrap|9,000 troops:}} three [[battalion]]s of the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Greek Division]], which had been left behind when the rest of the unit had been transferred to the mainland against the German invasion; the [[Cretan Gendarmerie]] (2.500 men); the [[Heraklion]] Garrison Battalion, a defence unit made up mostly of transport and supply personnel; and remnants of the 12th and 20th Greek Divisions, which had also escaped from the mainland to Crete and were organised under British command. Cadets from the Gendarmerie academy and recruits from Greek training centres in the [[Peloponnese]] had been transferred to Crete to replace the trained soldiers sent to fight on the mainland. These troops were already organised into numbered recruit training regiments, and it was decided to use this structure to organise the Greek troops, supplementing them with experienced men arriving from the mainland.\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] contingent consisted of the original {{nowrap|14,000-man}} British garrison and another {{nowrap|25,000 British}} and Commonwealth troops evacuated from the mainland. The evacuees were typically intact units; composite units improvised locally; stragglers from every type of army unit; and [[deserter]]s; most of them lacked heavy equipment. The main formed units were the [[2nd New Zealand Division]], less the 6th Brigade and division headquarters; the [[Australian 6th Division|19th Australian Brigade Group]]; and the [[14th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|14th Infantry Brigade]] of the British [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Division]]. There were about 15,000 front-line Commonwealth infantry, augmented by about 5,000 non-infantry personnel equipped as infantry and a composite Australian [[artillery battery]].<ref name=long218-219>{{harvnb|Long|1953|pp=218\u2013219}}.</ref> On 4 May, Freyberg sent a message to the British commander in the Middle East, General [[Archibald Wavell]], requesting the evacuation of about 10,000 unwanted personnel who did not have weapons and had \"little or no employment other than getting into trouble with the civil population\". As the weeks passed, some 3,200 British, 2,500 Australian and 1,300 New Zealander troops were evacuated to Egypt, but it became evident that it would not be possible to remove all the unwanted troops. Between the night of 15 May and morning of 16 May, the allied forces were reinforced by the 2nd Battalion of the [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|Leicester Regiment]], which had been transported from Alexandria to Heraklion by {{HMS|Gloucester|62|6}} and {{HMS|Fiji|58|6}}.<ref name=\"Cunningham S2 P5\">Cunningham, Section 2 paragraph 5</ref>\n\nOn 17 May, the garrison on Crete included about 15,000 Britons, 7,750 New Zealanders, 6,500 Australians and 10,200 Greeks.<ref name=long210-213>{{harvnb|Long|1953|pp=210\u2013213}}</ref> On the morning of 19 May, these were augmented by a further 700 men of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], who had been transported from Alexandria to [[Tymbaki]] overnight by {{HMS|Glengyle||6}}.<ref name=\"Cunningham S2 P5\"/>\n\n====Axis forces====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-0816, Kreta, Lastensegler DFS 230, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger.jpg|thumb|A ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' and a [[DFS 230]] glider in Crete]]\n[[File:German troops board a Junkers 52 for Crete.jpg|thumb|German [[mountain troops]] board a Junkers Ju 52 for Crete, 20 May 1941.]]\nOn 25 April, Hitler signed Directive 28, ordering the invasion of Crete. The Royal Navy retained control of the waters around Crete, so an [[amphibious assault]] would have been a risky proposition. With German air superiority assured, an airborne invasion was chosen. This was to be the first big airborne invasion, although the Germans had made smaller parachute and [[military glider|glider]]-borne assaults in the invasions of [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|Denmark]] and [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]], [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Battle of France|France]] and mainland [[Battle of Greece|Greece]]. In Greece, {{lang|de|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger}} had been dispatched to capture the bridge over the [[Corinth Canal]], which was being readied for demolition by the [[Royal Engineers]]. German engineers landed near the bridge in gliders, while parachute infantry attacked the perimeter defence. The bridge was damaged in the fighting, which slowed the German advance and gave the Allies time to evacuate 18,000 troops to Crete and 23,000 to Egypt, albeit with the loss of most of their heavy equipment.<ref>{{harvnb|Antill|2005|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nIn May, [[Fliegerkorps XI|''Fliegerkorps'' XI]] moved from Germany to the Athens area, but the destruction wrought during the invasion of Greece forced a postponement of the attack to 20 May. New airfields were built, and 280 long-range bombers, {{nowrap|150 dive-bombers,}} {{nowrap|90 Bf 109s,}} {{nowrap|90 Bf 110s}} and 40 reconnaissance aircraft of [[8th Air Corps (Germany)|''Fliegerkorps'' VIII]] were assembled, along with {{nowrap|530 Ju 52}} transport aircraft and 100 gliders. The {{nobr|Bf 109s}} and ''Stuka'' dive-bombers were based on forward airfields at Mulaoi, Melos and Karpathos (then Scarpanto), with Corinth and Argos as base airfields. The {{nobr|Bf 110s}} were based at airfields near Athens, Argos and Corinth, all within {{cvt|200|mi|km}} of Crete, and the bomber or reconnaissance machines were accommodated at Athens, Salonica and a detachment on Rhodes, along with bases in Bulgaria at Sofia and Plovdiv, ten of the airfields being all-weather and {{convert|200|\u2013|250|mi|km}} from Crete. The transport aircraft flew from bases near Athens and southern Greece, including Eleusis, Tatoi, Megara and Corinth. British night bombers attacked the areas in the last few nights before the invasion, and ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft eliminated the British aircraft on Crete.{{sfn|Air|2001 |p=124}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L19017, Gebirgsj\u00e4ger vor dem Start nach Kreta.jpg|thumb|German Mountain troops prior to their transfer to Crete.]]\nThe Germans planned to use {{lang|de|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger}} to capture important points on the island, including airfields that could then be used to fly in supplies and reinforcements. ''Fliegerkorps'' XI was to co-ordinate the attack by the [[German 7th Air Division|7th ''Flieger'' Division]], which would land by parachute and glider, followed by the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22nd Air Landing Division]] once the airfields were secure. The operation was scheduled for 16 May 1941, but was postponed to 20 May, with the [[5th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Mountain Division]] replacing the 22nd Air Landing Division. To support the German attack on Crete, eleven Italian submarines tookpost off Crete or the British bases of Sollum and Alexandria in Egypt.<ref name=\"Bertke, Smith 2012, p. 505\">Bertke, Smith & Kindell 2012, p. 505</ref>{{ref label|Note|d|d}}\n\n===Intelligence===\n====British====\nIt had only been in March 1941, that Student added an attack on Crete to Operation Marita; supply difficulties delayed the assembly of ''Fliegerkorps'' XI and its {{nowrap|500 Ju 52s,}} then more delays forced a postponement until 20 May 1941. The War Cabinet in Britain had expected the Germans to use paratroops in the Balkans, and on 25 March, British decrypts of ''Luftwaffe'' [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] wireless traffic revealed that ''Fliegerkorps'' XI was assembling Ju 52s for glider-towing, and British Military Intelligence reported that {{nowrap|250 aircraft}} were already in the Balkans. On 30 March, ''Detachment S\u00fcssmann'', part of the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th ''Fliegerdivision'']], was identified at Plovdiv. Notice of the target of these units did not arrive, but on 18 April it was found that {{nowrap|250 Ju 52s}} had been withdrawn from routine operations, and on 24 April it became known that G\u00f6ring had reserved them for a special operation. The operation turned out to be a descent on the Corinth Canal on 26 April, but then a second operation was discovered and that supplies (particularly of fuel), had to be delivered to ''Fliegerkorps'' XI by 5 May; a ''Luftwaffe'' message referred to Crete for the first time was decrypted on 26 April.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe British Chiefs of Staff were apprehensive that the target could be changed to Cyprus or Syria as a route into Iraq during the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] {{nowrap|(2\u201331 May}} 1941) and suspected that references to Crete were a deception, despite having no grounds for this, and on 3 May Churchill thought that the attack might be a decoy. The command in Crete had been informed on 18 April, despite the doubts, and Crete was added to a link from the [[Government Communications Headquarters|GC & CS]] to Cairo, while on 16 and 21 April, intelligence that airborne operations were being prepared in Bulgaria was passed on. On 22 April, the HQ in Crete was ordered to burn all material received through the [[Ultra]] link, but Churchill ruled that the information must still be provided. When Freyberg took over on 30 April, the information was disguised as information from a spy in Athens. Remaining doubts about an attack on Crete were removed on 1 May, when the ''Luftwaffe'' was ordered to stop bombing airfields on the island and mining [[Souda Bay]] and to photograph all of the island. By 5 May, it was clear that the attack was not imminent and next day, 17 May was revealed as the expected day for the completion of preparations, along with the operation orders for the plan from the D-day landings in the vicinity of Maleme and Chania, Heraklion and Rethymno.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=81\u201382}}\n\n====German====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-452-0985-36, Russland, Gener\u00e4le L\u00f6hr und W. v.

It is not clear whether Canaris, who had an extensive intelligence network at his disposal, was misinformed or was attempting to sabotage Hitler's plans (Canaris was killed much later in the war for supposedly participating in the [[20 July Plot]]). ''Abwehr'' also predicted the Cretan population would welcome the Germans as liberators, due to their strong [[History of the Hellenic Republic|republican]] and anti-[[Greek monarchy|monarchist]] feelings and would want to receive the \"...&nbsp;favourable terms which had been arranged on the mainland&nbsp;...\"{{sfn|Buckley|1952|p=163}} While the late republican prime minister of Greece, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], had been a Cretan and support for his ideas was strong on the island, the Germans seriously underestimated Cretan loyalty. King [[George II of Greece|George]] and his entourage escaped from Greece via Crete, with the help of Greek and Commonwealth soldiers, Cretan civilians and even a band of prisoners who had been released from captivity by the Germans. 12th Army Intelligence painted a less optimistic picture, but also underestimated the number of British Commonwealth forces and the number of Greek troops who had been evacuated from the mainland. General [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], the theatre commander, was convinced the island could be taken with two divisions, but decided to keep 6th Mountain Division in [[Athens]] as a reserve.\n\n===Weapons and equipment===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n\n====German====\n{{further|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)}}\n[[File:Kreta Cuffband.jpg|thumb|[[Crete Cuff Title]] for [[Wehrmacht]] participants of the campaign]]\nThe Germans used the new [[7.5 cm Leichtgesch\u00fctz 40|7.5 cm ''Leichtgesch\u00fctz'' 40]] light gun (a [[recoilless rifle]]). At {{convert|320|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, it weighed {{frac|1|10}} as much as a standard German 75&nbsp;mm [[field gun]], yet had {{frac|2|3}} of its range. It fired a {{convert|13|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shell more than {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}}. A quarter of the German paratroops jumped with an [[MP 40]] [[submachine gun]], often carried with a [[bolt-action]] [[Karabiner 98k|''Karabiner'' 98k]] rifle and most German squads had an [[MG 34]] [[General purpose machine gun|machine gun]].<ref>{{harvnb|Antill|2005|p=25}}.</ref> The Germans used colour-coded parachutes to distinguish the canisters carrying rifles, ammunition, crew-served weapons and other supplies. Heavy equipment like the ''Leichtgesch\u00fctz 40'' were dropped with a special triple-parachute harness to bear the extra weight.\n\nThe troops also carried special strips of cloth to unfurl in patterns to signal to low-flying fighters, to co-ordinate air support and for supply drops. The German procedure was for individual weapons to be dropped in canisters, due to their practice of exiting the aircraft at low altitude. This was a flaw that left the paratroopers armed only with knives, pistols and grenades in the first few minutes after landing. Poor design of German parachutes compounded the problem; the standard German harness had only one riser to the [[Canopy (parachute)|canopy]] and could not be steered. Even the 25 percent of paratroops armed with sub-machine guns were at a disadvantage, given the weapon's limited range. Many ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' were shot before they reached weapons canisters.\n\n====Greek====\nGreek troops were armed with ''[[Mannlicher\u2013Sch\u00f6nauer]]'' [[6.5\u00d754mm Mannlicher\u2013Sch\u00f6nauer|6.5&nbsp;mm]] mountain carbines or ex-Austrian 8x56R ''[[Steyr-Mannlicher M1895]]'' rifles, the latter a part of post-[[World War I reparations]]; about 1,000 Greeks carried antique ''[[Fusil Gras mle 1874]]'' rifles. The garrison had been stripped of its best [[crew-served weapon]]s, which were sent to the mainland; there were twelve obsolescent ''[[St. \u00c9tienne Mle 1907]]'' light machine-guns and forty miscellaneous LMGs. Many Greek soldiers had fewer than thirty rounds of ammunition but could not be supplied by the British, who had no stocks in the correct calibres. Those with insufficient ammunition were posted to the eastern sector of Crete, where the Germans were not expected in force. The 8th Greek Regiment was under strength and many soldiers were poorly trained and poorly equipped. The unit was attached to 10th New Zealand Infantry Brigade ([[Brigadier]] [[Howard Kippenberger]]), who placed it in a defensive position around the village of [[Alikianos]] where, with local civilian volunteers, they held out against the German 7th Engineer Battalion.\n\nThough Kippenberger had referred to them as \"...nothing more than malaria-ridden little chaps...with only four weeks of service,\" the Greek troops repulsed German attacks until they ran out of ammunition, whereupon they began charging with fixed bayonets, overrunning German positions and capturing rifles and ammunition. The engineers had to be reinforced by two battalions of German paratroops, yet the 8th Regiment held on until 27 May, when the Germans made a [[combined arms]] assault by ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft and mountain troops. The Greek stand helped to protect the retreat of the Commonwealth forces, who were evacuated at [[Sfakia]]. Beevor and McDougal Stewart write that the defence of Alikianos gained at least 24 more hours for the completion of the final leg of the evacuation behind [[Layforce]]. The troops who were protected as they withdrew had begun the battle with more and better equipment than the 8th Greek Regiment.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n====British Commonwealth====\nBritish and Commonwealth troops used the standard [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifle, [[Bren light machine gun]] and [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers medium machine gun]]. The British had about 85 artillery pieces of various calibres, many of them captured Italian weapons without sights.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|1995|p=153}}.</ref> [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft]] defences consisted of one light anti-aircraft battery equipped with 20&nbsp;mm automatic cannon, split between the two airfields. The guns were camouflaged, often in nearby olive groves, and some were ordered to hold their fire during the initial assault to mask their positions from German fighters and [[dive-bomber]]s. The British had nine [[Matilda II]]A infantry tanks of \"B\" Squadron, [[7th Royal Tank Regiment]] (7th RTR) and sixteen [[Light Tank Mk VI|Light Tanks Mark VIB]] from \"C\" Squadron, [[3rd King's Own Hussars]].<ref name=\"Antill 2005 24\">{{harvnb|Antill|2005|p=24}}.</ref>\n\nThe Matildas had 40&nbsp;mm [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder]] guns, which only fired [[armour-piercing round]]s \u2013 not effective anti-personnel weapons. (High explosive rounds in small calibres were considered impractical).<ref name=\"Antill 2005 24\"/> The tanks were in poor mechanical condition, as the engines were worn and could not be overhauled on Crete. Most tanks were used as mobile [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]] to be brought up and dug in at strategic points. One Matilda had a damaged turret crank that allowed it to turn clockwise only. Many British tanks broke down in the rough terrain, not in combat. The British and their allies did not possess sufficient [[Universal Carrier]]s or trucks, which would have provided the mobility and firepower needed for rapid counter-attacks before the invaders could consolidate.<ref name=\"Antill 2005 24\"/>\n\n===Strategy and tactics===\n====Operation Mercury====\n[[File:Battle of crete.svg|thumb|Map of the German assault on Crete]]\nHitler authorised ''Unternehmen Merkur'' (named after the swift Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]) with Directive 28; the forces used were to come from airborne and air units already in the area and units intended for ''Unternehmen Barbarossa'' were to conclude operations before the end of May, ''Barbarossa'' was not to be delayed by the attack on Crete, which had to begin soon or would be cancelled.

The ''Luftwaffe'' commander, [[Generaloberst|Colonel General]] Alexander L\u00f6hr, and the ''Kriegsmarine'' commander, Admiral Karl-Georg Schuster, wanted more emphasis on Maleme, to achieve overwhelming superiority of force.<ref name=\"Kavanaugh 2010 38\">{{harvnb|Kavanaugh|2010|p=38}}</ref> [[Kurt Student|Major-General Kurt Student]] wanted to disperse the paratroops more, to maximise the effect of surprise.<ref name=\"Kavanaugh 2010 38\"/> As the primary objective, Maleme offered several advantages: it was the largest airfield and big enough for heavy transport aircraft, it was close enough to the mainland for air cover from land-based [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters and it was near the north coast, so seaborne reinforcements could be brought up quickly. A compromise plan by [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was agreed, and in the final draft, Maleme was to be captured first, while not ignoring the other objectives.<ref>{{harvnb|Kavanaugh|2010|p=39}}</ref>\n\nThe invasion force was divided into ''Kampfgruppen'' (battlegroups), Centre, West and East, each with a code name following the classical theme established by Mercury; 750 glider-borne troops, 10,000 paratroops, 5,000 airlifted mountain soldiers and 7,000 seaborne troops were allocated to the invasion. The largest proportion of the forces were in Group West. German airborne theory was based on parachuting a small force onto enemy airfields. The force would capture the perimeter and local anti-aircraft guns, allowing a much larger force to land by glider.<ref>{{harvnb|Antill|2005|p=32}}</ref> Freyberg knew this after studying earlier German operations and decided to make the airfields unusable for landing, but was countermanded by the [[Middle East Command]] in Alexandria.<ref name=\"Vick 1995 pg=27\">{{harvnb|Vick|1995|pg=27}}</ref> The staff felt the invasion was doomed now that it had been compromised and may have wanted the airfields intact for the RAF once the invasion was defeated.<ref name=\"Vick 1995 pg=27\"/> (The Germans were able to land reinforcements without fully operational airfields. One transport pilot crash-landed on a beach, others landed in fields, discharged their cargo and took off again.

The [[21st Battalion (New Zealand)|21st]], [[22nd Battalion (New Zealand)|22nd]] and [[23rd Battalion (New Zealand)|23rd New Zealand battalions]] held Maleme Airfield and the vicinity.

Greek police and cadets took part, with the 1st Greek Regiment (Provisional) combining with armed civilians to rout a detachment of German paratroopers dropped at [[Kissamos|Kastelli]]. The 8th Greek Regiment and elements of the Cretan forces severely hampered movement by the 95th Reconnaissance Battalion on [[Kolimbari]] and [[Paleochora]], where Allied reinforcements from North Africa could be landed.\n\n====Rethymno\u2013Heraklion sector====\n{{Main|Battle of Rethymno}}\n[[File:Paratroopers Crete '41.JPG|thumb|More German paratroops landing on Crete from [[Junkers 52]] transports, 20 May 1941.]]\nA second wave of German transports supported by Luftwaffe and [[Regia Aeronautica]] attack aircraft, arrived in the afternoon, dropping more paratroopers and gliders containing assault troops.<ref>Germany and the Second World War, Volume 3, Milit\u00e4rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt,  p. 546, Oxford University Press, 1995</ref> One group attacked at Rethymno at 16:15 and another attacked at Heraklion at 17:30, where the defenders were waiting for them and inflicted many casualties.\n\nThe Rethymno\u2013Heraklion sector was defended by the British 14th Brigade, as well as the [[2/4th Australian Infantry Battalion]] and the Greek 3rd, 7th and \"Garrison\" (ex-5th Crete Division) battalions. The Greeks lacked equipment and supplies, particularly the Garrison Battalion. The Germans pierced the defensive cordon around Heraklion on the first day, seizing the Greek barracks on the west edge of the town and capturing the docks; the Greeks counter-attacked and recaptured both points.

The force sank an isolated''ca\u00efque'' at 08:30, saving itself from an air attack that struck the cruiser [[HMS Naiad (93)|HMS ''Naiad'']] as the German pilots tried to avoid killing their troops in the water. The British squadron was under constant air attack and, short of anti-aircraft ammunition, steamed on toward Milos, sighting ''Sagittario'' at 10:00. King made the \"difficult\" decision not to press the attack, despite his overpowering advantage, because of the shortage of ammunition and the severity of the air attacks.<ref>Cunningham, Section 1, paragraph 5.</ref> The transports were defended by a torpedo charge by ''Sagittario'', which also laid a smoke screen and traded fired with the British force. Eventually, the convoy and its escort managed to slip away undamaged.

During the search and withdrawal from the area, Force C suffered many losses to German bombers. ''Naiad'' was damaged by near misses and the cruiser {{HMS|Carlisle|D67|6}} was hit.

Upon nearing the shore on 28 May, the lighter was positioned ahead of the tug and firmly beached. A party of engineers then blew the lighter's bow off using demolition charges and the two tanks rolled ashore. They were soon assigned to ''Advance Detachment Wittman'', which had assembled near Prison Valley reservoir the day before. This ad-hoc group was composed of a motorcycle battalion, the Reconnaissance Battalion, an anti-tank unit, a motorized artillery troop, and some engineers.

The garrisons at [[Souda]] and [[Beritania]] gradually fell back along the road to [[Vitsilokoumos]], north of Sfakia. About halfway there, near the village of [[Askyfou]] lay a large crater nicknamed \"The Saucer\", the only place wide and flat enough for a large parachute drop. Troops were stationed about its perimeter, to prevent a landing that might block the retreat.\nOn the evening of the 27th, a small detachment of German troops penetrated Allied lines near Imbros Gorge threatening a column of retreating unarmed Allied forces. The attack was held off by four men, the only ones with weapons. Led by Cpl Douglas Bignal, the men sacrificed themselves, securing the withdrawal of the remainder. Amongst this group was New Zealander Pte Willy Falconer of the Maori battalion, a hero of 42nd Street and Galatas. Also killed were LCpl Philip Stamp and Pte Andrew Payton.\n\nNear Souda, the 5th New Zealand Brigade and the 2/7th Australian Battalion, held off the 141st Mountain Regiment, which had begun a flanking manoeuvre, and on 28 May, at the village of [[Stylos]], the 5th New Zealand Brigade fought a rearguard action. The ''Luftwaffe'' was over Rethymno and Heraklion and they were able to retreat down the road.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|1956|p=144}}\n\nThe retreat of the brigade was covered by two companies of the M\u0101ori Battalion under Captain Rangi Royal, who overran the I Battalion, 141st ''Gebirgsj\u00e4ger'' Regiment and halted the German advance. When the main unit was safely to the rear, the M\u0101ori retreated {{convert|24|mi|km}}, losing only two killed and eight wounded, all of whom were recovered. Layforce was the only big unit in this area to be cut off. Layforce had been sent to Crete by way of Sfakia when it was still hoped that reinforcements could be brought from Egypt to turn the tide of the battle.<ref name=\"Saunders55\"/> The battalion-sized force was split up, with a 200-man detachment under Laycock at Souda to cover the retreat of the heavier units. Layforce and three British tanks were joined by the men of the 20th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery, who had been assigned to guard Souda docks and refused to believe that an evacuation had been ordered. After a day of battle, Laycock ordered a night retreat to Beritiana, where he was joined by Royal and the M\u0101ori, who managed to fight their way out, but Layforce was cut off near the village of Babali Khani ([[Agioi Pandes]]). Laycock and his [[brigade major]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], were able to escape in a tank. Most of the other men of the detachment and the 20th HAA Battery were killed or captured.

On several occasions, villagers were rounded up and summarily executed.

A postponement of the invasion was revealed on 15 May, and on 19 May, the probable date was given as the next day. The German objectives in Crete were similar to the areas already being prepared by the British, but foreknowledge increased the confidence of the local commanders in their dispositions. On 14 May, London warned that the attack could come any time after 17 May, which information Freyberg passed on to the garrison. On 16 May the British authorities expected an attack by 25,000 to 30,000 airborne troops in {{nowrap|600 aircraft}} and by 10,000 troops transported by sea. (The real figures were 15,750 airborne troops in {{nowrap|520 aircraft}} and {{nowrap|7,000 by}} sea; late decrypts reduced uncertainty over the seaborne invasion.) The British mistakes were smaller than those of the Germans, who estimated the garrison to be only a third of the true figure. (The after-action report of ''Fliegerkorps XI'' contained a passage recounting that the operational area had been so well prepared that it gave the impression that the garrison had known the time of the invasion.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=82\u201384}})\n\nThe Germans captured a message from London marked \"Personal for General Freyberg\" which was translated into German and sent to Berlin.

[...] Moreover, tight security regulations prohibiting him from taking action on the basis of uncorroborated Ultra evidence limited its value.\n}}\n</ref>\nWhile emphasis was placed on the airborne assault, the German messages also mentioned seaborne operations; Freyberg, expecting an amphibious landing, garrisoned the coast \u2013 which reduced the number of men available to defend the airfield at Maleme, the principal German objective.<ref>{{harvnb|Antill|2005|p=36}}.</ref> In 1993, [[F.

It was the only unit of its kind and was not rebuilt.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p= 84}}\n\nHinsley wrote that it was difficult to measure the influence of intelligence gained during the battle, because although Ultra revealed German situation reports, reinforcement details and unit identifications and although more intelligence was gleaned from prisoners and captured documents, it was not known how swiftly the information reached Freyberg or how he used it. The German parachute warfare manual had been captured in 1940, and after the war, Student said that he would have changed tactics had he known this. Field-signals intelligence was obtained, including bombing instructions and information from the ''Fliegerkorps'' XI tactical code. Lack of air cover prevented much British air reconnaissance north of Crete, but on 21 May signals intelligence enabled an aircraft to spot a convoy.

It began on the morning of 20 May 1941, when [[Nazi Germany]] began an [[Airborne forces|airborne invasion]] of Crete. [[Hellenic Army|Greek]] and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]], along with Cretan civilians, defended the island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/the-battle-for-crete|title=The Battle for Crete |website=www.nzhistory.net.nz}}</ref> After one day of fighting, the Germans had suffered heavy casualties and the Allied troops were confident that they would defeat the invasion. The next day, through communication failures, Allied tactical hesitation and German offensive operations, [[Maleme Airfield]] in western Crete fell, enabling the Germans to land reinforcements and overwhelm the defensive positions on the north of the island. Allied forces withdrew to the south coast. More than half were evacuated by the British [[Royal Navy]] and the remainder surrendered or joined the [[Cretan resistance]]. The defence of Crete evolved into a costly naval engagement; by the end of the campaign the Royal Navy's eastern Mediterranean strength had been reduced to only two battleships and three cruisers.<ref name=\"Pack 1973 91\">{{harvnb|Pack|1973|p=91}}.</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Crete was the first occasion where ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (German paratroops) were used ''en masse'', the first mainly airborne invasion in military history, the first time the Allies made significant use of intelligence from decrypted German messages from the [[Enigma machine]],<ref name=\"Collier2014\">{{cite book|author=Paul Collier|title=The Second World War (4): The Mediterranean 1940\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWuICwAAQBAJ&pg=PT74|date=6 June 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0990-2|page=74|quote=The first convincing demonstration of this potential in operational conditions came in May 1941, when the entire plan for the German airborne capture of Crete was decrypted two weeks before the invasion took place.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Beevor|first1=Antony|title=Crete: The Battle and the Resistance |date=1992|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0-14-016787-0}}</ref> and the first time [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] encountered mass resistance from a civilian population.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Maloney |first=Shane |title=Bogin, Hopit |work=[[The Monthly]] |date=July 2006 |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/nation-reviewed-shane-maloney-bogin-hopit--242}}</ref> Due to the number of casualties and the belief that airborne forces no longer had the advantage of surprise, [[Adolf Hitler]] became reluctant to authorise further large airborne operations, preferring instead to employ paratroopers as ground troops.<ref name=\"Beevor_p229-230\">{{harvnb|Beevor|1991|pp=229\u2013230}}</ref> In contrast, the Allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers and started to form airborne-assault and [[RAF Regiment|airfield-defence regiments]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Greece}}\nBritish forces had initially garrisoned Crete when the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] [[Greco-Italian War|attacked Greece]] on 28 October 1940,<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1953|p=203}},</ref> enabling the Greek government to employ the [[5th Airmobile Brigade (Greece)|Fifth Cretan Division]] in the mainland campaign.<ref name=\"Beevor 1991 11\">{{harvnb|Beevor|1991|p=11}}</ref> This arrangement suited the British: Crete could provide the Royal Navy with excellent harbours in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], from which it could threaten the Axis south-eastern flank,<ref>{{harvnb|Murfett|2008|p=114}}</ref> and the [[Ploie\u0219ti]] oil fields in [[Romania]] would be within range of British [[bomber]]s based on the island.\n\nThe Italians were repulsed, but the subsequent German invasion of April 1941 ([[Battle of Greece|Operation Marita]]), succeeded in overrunning mainland Greece. At the end of the month, 57,000 Allied troops were evacuated by the Royal Navy.

Equipment was scarce in the Mediterranean and in the backwater of Crete. The British forces had seven commanders in seven months. In early April, airfields at Maleme and Heraklion and the landing strip at [[Rethymno]] on the north coast were ready and another strip at Pediada-Kastelli was nearly finished. After the German invasion of Greece, the role of the Crete garrison changed from the defence of a naval anchorage to preparing to repel an invasion. On 17 April, Group Captain [[George Beamish]] was appointed Senior Air Officer, Crete, taking over from a flight-lieutenant whose duties and instructions had been only vaguely defined. Beamish was ordered to prepare the reception of the [[Bristol Blenheim]] bombers of [[No. 30 Squadron RAF|30]] and [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203]] Squadrons from Egypt and the remaining fighter aircraft from Greece, to cover the evacuation of W Force, which enabled the transfer of {{nowrap|25,000 British}} and Dominion troops to the island, preparatory to their relief by fresh troops from Egypt.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=324\u2013325}}\n\nThe navy tried to deliver {{convert|27,000 |LT|t}} of supplies from {{nowrap|1\u201320 May}} 1941, but ''Luftwaffe'' attacks forced most ships to turn back, and only {{cvt |2,700|LT|t}} were delivered. Only about {{nowrap|3,500 trained}} British and Greek soldiers were on the island, and the defence devolved to the shaken and poorly equipped troops from Greece, assisted by the last fighters of [[No. 33 Squadron RAF|33]], [[No. 80 Squadron RAF|80]] and [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|112]] Squadrons and a squadron of the [[Fleet Air Arm]], once the Blenheims were ordered back to Egypt. In mid-May, the four squadrons had about two dozen aircraft, of which only about twelve were serviceable due to a lack of tools and spares. The unfinished ground at Pediada-Kastelli was blocked with trenches and heaps of soil and all but narrow flight paths were blocked at Heraklion and Rethymno by barrels full of earth. At Maleme, [[Revetment (aircraft)|blast pens]] were built for the aircraft, and barrels full of petrol were kept ready to be ignited by machine-gun fire. Around each ground, a few field guns, anti-aircraft guns, two [[infantry tank]]s and two or three light tanks were sited. The three areas were made into independent sectors, but there were only eight [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|QF 3-inch]] and twenty [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Richards |1974|pp=325\u2013327}}\n\n[[File:Lieutenant General Freyberg gazes over the parapet.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Major-General Freyberg]] (right), Allied Commander at the Battle of Crete]]\nOn 30 April 1941, [[Major-General]] [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Bernard Freyberg]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]] a [[New Zealand Army]] officer, was appointed commander of the Allied forces on Crete (Creforce).{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|1956|p=126}} By May, the Greek forces consisted of approximately {{nowrap|9,000 troops:}} three [[battalion]]s of the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Greek Division]], which had been left behind when the rest of the unit had been transferred to the mainland against the German invasion; the [[Cretan Gendarmerie]] (2.500 men); the [[Heraklion]] Garrison Battalion, a defence unit made up mostly of transport and supply personnel; and remnants of the 12th and 20th Greek Divisions, which had also escaped from the mainland to Crete and were organised under British command. Cadets from the Gendarmerie academy and recruits from Greek training centres in the [[Peloponnese]] had been transferred to Crete to replace the trained soldiers sent to fight on the mainland. These troops were already organised into numbered recruit training regiments, and it was decided to use this structure to organise the Greek troops, supplementing them with experienced men arriving from the mainland.\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] contingent consisted of the original {{nowrap|14,000-man}} British garrison and another {{nowrap|25,000 British}} and Commonwealth troops evacuated from the mainland. The evacuees were typically intact units; composite units improvised locally; stragglers from every type of army unit; and [[deserter]]s; most of them lacked heavy equipment. The main formed units were the [[2nd New Zealand Division]], less the 6th Brigade and division headquarters; the [[Australian 6th Division|19th Australian Brigade Group]]; and the [[14th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|14th Infantry Brigade]] of the British [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Division]]. There were about 15,000 front-line Commonwealth infantry, augmented by about 5,000 non-infantry personnel equipped as infantry and a composite Australian [[artillery battery]].<ref name=long218-219>{{harvnb|Long|1953|pp=218\u2013219}}.</ref> On 4 May, Freyberg sent a message to the British commander in the Middle East, General [[Archibald Wavell]], requesting the evacuation of about 10,000 unwanted personnel who did not have weapons and had \"little or no employment other than getting into trouble with the civil population\". As the weeks passed, some 3,200 British, 2,500 Australian and 1,300 New Zealander troops were evacuated to Egypt, but it became evident that it would not be possible to remove all the unwanted troops. Between the night of 15 May and morning of 16 May, the allied forces were reinforced by the 2nd Battalion of the [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|Leicester Regiment]], which had been transported from Alexandria to Heraklion by {{HMS|Gloucester|62|6}} and {{HMS|Fiji|58|6}}.<ref name=\"Cunningham S2 P5\">Cunningham, Section 2 paragraph 5</ref>\n\nOn 17 May, the garrison on Crete included about 15,000 Britons, 7,750 New Zealanders, 6,500 Australians and 10,200 Greeks.<ref name=long210-213>{{harvnb|Long|1953|pp=210\u2013213}}</ref> On the morning of 19 May, these were augmented by a further 700 men of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], who had been transported from Alexandria to [[Tymbaki]] overnight by {{HMS|Glengyle||6}}.<ref name=\"Cunningham S2 P5\"/>\n\n====Axis forces====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-0816, Kreta, Lastensegler DFS 230, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger.jpg|thumb|A ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' and a [[DFS 230]] glider in Crete]]\n[[File:German troops board a Junkers 52 for Crete.jpg|thumb|German [[mountain troops]] board a Junkers Ju 52 for Crete, 20 May 1941.]]\nOn 25 April, Hitler signed Directive 28, ordering the invasion of Crete. The Royal Navy retained control of the waters around Crete, so an [[amphibious assault]] would have been a risky proposition. With German air superiority assured, an airborne invasion was chosen. This was to be the first big airborne invasion, although the Germans had made smaller parachute and [[military glider|glider]]-borne assaults in the invasions of [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|Denmark]] and [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]], [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Battle of France|France]] and mainland [[Battle of Greece|Greece]]. In Greece, {{lang|de|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger}} had been dispatched to capture the bridge over the [[Corinth Canal]], which was being readied for demolition by the [[Royal Engineers]]. German engineers landed near the bridge in gliders, while parachute infantry attacked the perimeter defence. The bridge was damaged in the fighting, which slowed the German advance and gave the Allies time to evacuate 18,000 troops to Crete and 23,000 to Egypt, albeit with the loss of most of their heavy equipment.<ref>{{harvnb|Antill|2005|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nIn May, [[Fliegerkorps XI|''Fliegerkorps'' XI]] moved from Germany to the Athens area, but the destruction wrought during the invasion of Greece forced a postponement of the attack to 20 May. New airfields were built, and 280 long-range bombers, {{nowrap|150 dive-bombers,}} {{nowrap|90 Bf 109s,}} {{nowrap|90 Bf 110s}} and 40 reconnaissance aircraft of [[8th Air Corps (Germany)|''Fliegerkorps'' VIII]] were assembled, along with {{nowrap|530 Ju 52}} transport aircraft and 100 gliders. The {{nobr|Bf 109s}} and ''Stuka'' dive-bombers were based on forward airfields at Mulaoi, Melos and Karpathos (then Scarpanto), with Corinth and Argos as base airfields. The {{nobr|Bf 110s}} were based at airfields near Athens, Argos and Corinth, all within {{cvt|200|mi|km}} of Crete, and the bomber or reconnaissance machines were accommodated at Athens, Salonica and a detachment on Rhodes, along with bases in Bulgaria at Sofia and Plovdiv, ten of the airfields being all-weather and {{convert|200|\u2013|250|mi|km}} from Crete. The transport aircraft flew from bases near Athens and southern Greece, including Eleusis, Tatoi, Megara and Corinth. British night bombers attacked the areas in the last few nights before the invasion, and ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft eliminated the British aircraft on Crete.{{sfn|Air|2001 |p=124}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L19017, Gebirgsj\u00e4ger vor dem Start nach Kreta.jpg|thumb|German Mountain troops prior to their transfer to Crete.]]\nThe Germans planned to use {{lang|de|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger}} to capture important points on the island, including airfields that could then be used to fly in supplies and reinforcements. ''Fliegerkorps'' XI was to co-ordinate the attack by the [[German 7th Air Division|7th ''Flieger'' Division]], which would land by parachute and glider, followed by the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22nd Air Landing Division]] once the airfields were secure. The operation was scheduled for 16 May 1941, but was postponed to 20 May, with the [[5th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Mountain Division]] replacing the 22nd Air Landing Division. To support the German attack on Crete, eleven Italian submarines took  post off Crete or the British bases of Sollum and Alexandria in Egypt.<ref name=\"Bertke, Smith 2012, p. 505\">Bertke, Smith & Kindell 2012, p. 505</ref>{{ref label|Note|d|d}}\n\n===Intelligence===\n====British====\nIt had only been in March 1941, that Student added an attack on Crete to Operation Marita; supply difficulties delayed the assembly of ''Fliegerkorps'' XI and its {{nowrap|500 Ju 52s,}} then more delays forced a postponement until 20 May 1941. The War Cabinet in Britain had expected the Germans to use paratroops in the Balkans, and on 25 March, British decrypts of ''Luftwaffe'' [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] wireless traffic revealed that ''Fliegerkorps'' XI was assembling Ju 52s for glider-towing, and British Military Intelligence reported that {{nowrap|250 aircraft}} were already in the Balkans. On 30 March, ''Detachment S\u00fcssmann'', part of the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th ''Fliegerdivision'']], was identified at Plovdiv. Notice of the target of these units did not arrive, but on 18 April it was found that {{nowrap|250 Ju 52s}} had been withdrawn from routine operations, and on 24 April it became known that G\u00f6ring had reserved them for a special operation. The operation turned out to be a descent on the Corinth Canal on 26 April, but then a second operation was discovered and that supplies (particularly of fuel), had to be delivered to ''Fliegerkorps'' XI by 5 May; a ''Luftwaffe'' message referred to Crete for the first time was decrypted on 26 April.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe British Chiefs of Staff were apprehensive that the target could be changed to Cyprus or Syria as a route into Iraq during the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] {{nowrap|(2\u201331 May}} 1941) and suspected that references to Crete were a deception, despite having no grounds for this, and on 3 May Churchill thought that the attack might be a decoy. The command in Crete had been informed on 18 April, despite the doubts, and Crete was added to a link from the [[Government Communications Headquarters|GC & CS]] to Cairo, while on 16 and 21 April, intelligence that airborne operations were being prepared in Bulgaria was passed on. On 22 April, the HQ in Crete was ordered to burn all material received through the [[Ultra]] link, but Churchill ruled that the information must still be provided. When Freyberg took over on 30 April, the information was disguised as information from a spy in Athens. Remaining doubts about an attack on Crete were removed on 1 May, when the ''Luftwaffe'' was ordered to stop bombing airfields on the island and mining [[Souda Bay]] and to photograph all of the island. By 5 May, it was clear that the attack was not imminent and next day, 17 May was revealed as the expected day for the completion of preparations, along with the operation orders for the plan from the D-day landings in the vicinity of Maleme and Chania, Heraklion and Rethymno.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=81\u201382}}\n\n====German====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-452-0985-36, Russland, Gener\u00e4le L\u00f6hr und W. v.

It is not clear whether Canaris, who had an extensive intelligence network at his disposal, was misinformed or was attempting to sabotage Hitler's plans (Canaris was killed much later in the war for supposedly participating in the [[20 July Plot]]). ''Abwehr'' also predicted the Cretan population would welcome the Germans as liberators, due to their strong [[History of the Hellenic Republic|republican]] and anti-[[Greek monarchy|monarchist]] feelings and would want to receive the \"...&nbsp;favourable terms which had been arranged on the mainland&nbsp;...\"{{sfn|Buckley|1952|p=163}} While the late republican prime minister of Greece, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], had been a Cretan and support for his ideas was strong on the island, the Germans seriously underestimated Cretan loyalty. King [[George II of Greece|George]] and his entourage escaped from Greece via Crete, with the help of Greek and Commonwealth soldiers, Cretan civilians and even a band of prisoners who had been released from captivity by the Germans. 12th Army Intelligence painted a less optimistic picture, but also underestimated the number of British Commonwealth forces and the number of Greek troops who had been evacuated from the mainland. General [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], the theatre commander, was convinced the island could be taken with two divisions, but decided to keep 6th Mountain Division in [[Athens]] as a reserve.\n\n===Weapons and equipment===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n\n====German====\n{{further|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)}}\n[[File:Kreta Cuffband.jpg|thumb|[[Crete Cuff Title]] for [[Wehrmacht]] participants of the campaign]]\nThe Germans used the new [[7.5 cm Leichtgesch\u00fctz 40|7.5 cm ''Leichtgesch\u00fctz'' 40]] light gun (a [[recoilless rifle]]). At {{convert|320|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, it weighed {{frac|1|10}} as much as a standard German 75&nbsp;mm [[field gun]], yet had {{frac|2|3}} of its range. It fired a {{convert|13|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shell more than {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}}. A quarter of the German paratroops jumped with an [[MP 40]] [[submachine gun]], often carried with a [[bolt-action]] [[Karabiner 98k|''Karabiner'' 98k]] rifle and most German squads had an [[MG 34]] [[General purpose machine gun|machine gun]].<ref>{{harvnb|Antill|2005|p=25}}.</ref> The Germans used colour-coded parachutes to distinguish the canisters carrying rifles, ammunition, crew-served weapons and other supplies. Heavy equipment like the ''Leichtgesch\u00fctz 40'' were dropped with a special triple-parachute harness to bear the extra weight.\n\nThe troops also carried special strips of cloth to unfurl in patterns to signal to low-flying fighters, to co-ordinate air support and for supply drops. The German procedure was for individual weapons to be dropped in canisters, due to their practice of exiting the aircraft at low altitude. This was a flaw that left the paratroopers armed only with knives, pistols and grenades in the first few minutes after landing. Poor design of German parachutes compounded the problem; the standard German harness had only one riser to the [[Canopy (parachute)|canopy]] and could not be steered. Even the 25 percent of paratroops armed with sub-machine guns were at a disadvantage, given the weapon's limited range. Many ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' were shot before they reached weapons canisters.\n\n====Greek====\nGreek troops were armed with ''[[Mannlicher\u2013Sch\u00f6nauer]]'' [[6.5\u00d754mm Mannlicher\u2013Sch\u00f6nauer|6.5&nbsp;mm]] mountain carbines or ex-Austrian 8x56R ''[[Steyr-Mannlicher M1895]]'' rifles, the latter a part of post-[[World War I reparations]]; about 1,000 Greeks carried antique ''[[Fusil Gras mle 1874]]'' rifles. The garrison had been stripped of its best [[crew-served weapon]]s, which were sent to the mainland; there were twelve obsolescent ''[[St. \u00c9tienne Mle 1907]]'' light machine-guns and forty miscellaneous LMGs. Many Greek soldiers had fewer than thirty rounds of ammunition but could not be supplied by the British, who had no stocks in the correct calibres. Those with insufficient ammunition were posted to the eastern sector of Crete, where the Germans were not expected in force. The 8th Greek Regiment was under strength and many soldiers were poorly trained and poorly equipped. The unit was attached to 10th New Zealand Infantry Brigade ([[Brigadier]] [[Howard Kippenberger]]), who placed it in a defensive position around the village of [[Alikianos]] where, with local civilian volunteers, they held out against the German 7th Engineer Battalion.\n\nThough Kippenberger had referred to them as \"...nothing more than malaria-ridden little chaps...with only four weeks of service,\" the Greek troops repulsed German attacks until they ran out of ammunition, whereupon they began charging with fixed bayonets, overrunning German positions and capturing rifles and ammunition. The engineers had to be reinforced by two battalions of German paratroops, yet the 8th Regiment held on until 27 May, when the Germans made a [[combined arms]] assault by ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft and mountain troops. The Greek stand helped to protect the retreat of the Commonwealth forces, who were evacuated at [[Sfakia]]. Beevor and McDougal Stewart write that the defence of Alikianos gained at least 24 more hours for the completion of the final leg of the evacuation behind [[Layforce]]. The troops who were protected as they withdrew had begun the battle with more and better equipment than the 8th Greek Regiment.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n====British Commonwealth====\nBritish and Commonwealth troops used the standard [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifle, [[Bren light machine gun]] and [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers medium machine gun]]. The British had about 85 artillery pieces of various calibres, many of them captured Italian weapons without sights.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|1995|p=153}}.</ref> [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft]] defences consisted of one light anti-aircraft battery equipped with 20&nbsp;mm automatic cannon, split between the two airfields. The guns were camouflaged, often in nearby olive groves, and some were ordered to hold their fire during the initial assault to mask their positions from German fighters and [[dive-bomber]]s. The British had nine [[Matilda II]]A infantry tanks of \"B\" Squadron, [[7th Royal Tank Regiment]] (7th RTR) and sixteen [[Light Tank Mk VI|Light Tanks Mark VIB]] from \"C\" Squadron, [[3rd King's Own Hussars]].<ref name=\"Antill 2005 24\">{{harvnb|Antill|2005|p=24}}.</ref>\n\nThe Matildas had 40&nbsp;mm [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder]] guns, which only fired [[armour-piercing round]]s \u2013 not effective anti-personnel weapons. (High explosive rounds in small calibres were considered impractical).<ref name=\"Antill 2005 24\"/> The tanks were in poor mechanical condition, as the engines were worn and could not be overhauled on Crete. Most tanks were used as mobile [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]] to be brought up and dug in at strategic points. One Matilda had a damaged turret crank that allowed it to turn clockwise only. Many British tanks broke down in the rough terrain, not in combat. The British and their allies did not possess sufficient [[Universal Carrier]]s or trucks, which would have provided the mobility and firepower needed for rapid counter-attacks before the invaders could consolidate.<ref name=\"Antill 2005 24\"/>\n\n===Strategy and tactics===\n====Operation Mercury====\n[[File:Battle of crete.svg|thumb|Map of the German assault on Crete]]\nHitler authorised ''Unternehmen Merkur'' (named after the swift Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]) with Directive 28; the forces used were to come from airborne and air units already in the area and units intended for ''Unternehmen Barbarossa'' were to conclude operations before the end of May, ''Barbarossa'' was not to be delayed by the attack on Crete, which had to begin soon or would be cancelled. Planning was rushed and much of ''Unternehmen Merkur'' was improvised, including the use of troops who were not trained for airborne assaults.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} The Germans planned to capture [[Maleme]], but there was debate over the concentration of forces there and the number to be deployed against other objectives, such as the smaller airfields at Heraklion and Rethymno. The ''Luftwaffe'' commander, [[Generaloberst|Colonel General]] Alexander L\u00f6hr, and the ''Kriegsmarine'' commander, Admiral Karl-Georg Schuster, wanted more emphasis on Maleme, to achieve overwhelming superiority of force.<ref name=\"Kavanaugh 2010 38\">{{harvnb|Kavanaugh|2010|p=38}}</ref> [[Kurt Student|Major-General Kurt Student]] wanted to disperse the paratroops more, to maximise the effect of surprise.<ref name=\"Kavanaugh 2010 38\"/> As the primary objective, Maleme offered several advantages: it was the largest airfield and big enough for heavy transport aircraft, it was close enough to the mainland for air cover from land-based [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters and it was near the north coast, so seaborne reinforcements could be brought up quickly. A compromise plan by [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was agreed, and in the final draft, Maleme was to be captured first, while not ignoring the other objectives.<ref>{{harvnb|Kavanaugh|2010|p=39}}</ref>\n\nThe invasion force was divided into ''Kampfgruppen'' (battlegroups), Centre, West and East, each with a code name following the classical theme established by Mercury; 750 glider-borne troops, 10,000 paratroops, 5,000 airlifted mountain soldiers and 7,000 seaborne troops were allocated to the invasion. The largest proportion of the forces were in Group West. German airborne theory was based on parachuting a small force onto enemy airfields. The force would capture the perimeter and local anti-aircraft guns, allowing a much larger force to land by glider.<ref>{{harvnb|Antill|2005|p=32}}</ref> Freyberg knew this after studying earlier German operations and decided to make the airfields unusable for landing, but was countermanded by the [[Middle East Command]] in Alexandria.<ref name=\"Vick 1995 pg=27\">{{harvnb|Vick|1995|pg=27}}</ref> The staff felt the invasion was doomed now that it had been compromised and may have wanted the airfields intact for the RAF once the invasion was defeated.<ref name=\"Vick 1995 pg=27\"/> (The Germans were able to land reinforcements without fully operational airfields. One transport pilot crash-landed on a beach, others landed in fields, discharged their cargo and took off again.

The [[21st Battalion (New Zealand)|21st]], [[22nd Battalion (New Zealand)|22nd]] and [[23rd Battalion (New Zealand)|23rd New Zealand battalions]] held Maleme Airfield and the vicinity.

Both forces were contained and failed to take the airfields, but the defenders had to deploy to face them.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|2011|pp= 135\u2013138}}</ref> Towards the evening of 20 May, the Germans slowly pushed the New Zealanders back from Hill 107, which overlooked the airfield. Greek police and cadets took part, with the 1st Greek Regiment (Provisional) combining with armed civilians to rout a detachment of German paratroopers dropped at [[Kissamos|Kastelli]]. The 8th Greek Regiment and elements of the Cretan forces severely hampered movement by the 95th Reconnaissance Battalion on [[Kolimbari]] and [[Paleochora]], where Allied reinforcements from North Africa could be landed.\n\n====Rethymno\u2013Heraklion sector====\n{{Main|Battle of Rethymno}}\n[[File:Paratroopers Crete '41.JPG|thumb|More German paratroops landing on Crete from [[Junkers 52]] transports, 20 May 1941.]]\nA second wave of German transports supported by Luftwaffe and [[Regia Aeronautica]] attack aircraft, arrived in the afternoon, dropping more paratroopers and gliders containing assault troops.<ref>Germany and the Second World War, Volume 3, Milit\u00e4rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt,  p. 546, Oxford University Press, 1995</ref> One group attacked at Rethymno at 16:15 and another attacked at Heraklion at 17:30, where the defenders were waiting for them and inflicted many casualties.\n\nThe Rethymno\u2013Heraklion sector was defended by the British 14th Brigade, as well as the [[2/4th Australian Infantry Battalion]] and the Greek 3rd, 7th and \"Garrison\" (ex-5th Crete Division) battalions. The Greeks lacked equipment and supplies, particularly the Garrison Battalion. The Germans pierced the defensive cordon around Heraklion on the first day, seizing the Greek barracks on the west edge of the town and capturing the docks; the Greeks counter-attacked and recaptured both points.

The force sank an isolated  ''ca\u00efque'' at 08:30, saving itself from an air attack that struck the cruiser [[HMS Naiad (93)|HMS ''Naiad'']] as the German pilots tried to avoid killing their troops in the water. The British squadron was under constant air attack and, short of anti-aircraft ammunition, steamed on toward Milos, sighting ''Sagittario'' at 10:00. King made the \"difficult\" decision not to press the attack, despite his overpowering advantage, because of the shortage of ammunition and the severity of the air attacks.<ref>Cunningham, Section 1, paragraph 5.</ref> The transports were defended by a torpedo charge by ''Sagittario'', which also laid a smoke screen and traded fired with the British force. Eventually, the convoy and its escort managed to slip away undamaged. King's ships, despite their failure to destroy the convoy, had succeeded in forcing the Axis to abort the landing by their mere presence at sea. During the search and withdrawal from the area, Force C suffered many losses to German bombers. ''Naiad'' was damaged by near misses and the cruiser {{HMS|Carlisle|D67|6}} was hit.

Force A1 headed east into the [[Kythera]] Channel, rendevousing with Force C between 13:30 and 14:00. As the more senior admiral, King took command, with air attacks now inflicting damage on both forces. A bomb struck [[HMS Warspite (03)|HMS ''Warspite'']] and the destroyer [[HMS Greyhound (H05)|HMS ''Greyhound'']] was sunk.

About halfway there, near the village of [[Askyfou]] lay a large crater nicknamed \"The Saucer\", the only place wide and flat enough for a large parachute drop. Troops were stationed about its perimeter, to prevent a landing that might block the retreat.\nOn the evening of the 27th, a small detachment of German troops penetrated Allied lines near Imbros Gorge threatening a column of retreating unarmed Allied forces. The attack was held off by four men, the only ones with weapons. Led by Cpl Douglas Bignal, the men sacrificed themselves, securing the withdrawal of the remainder.

When the main unit was safely to the rear, the M\u0101ori retreated {{convert|24|mi|km}}, losing only two killed and eight wounded, all of whom were recovered. Layforce was the only big unit in this area to be cut off. Layforce had been sent to Crete by way of Sfakia when it was still hoped that reinforcements could be brought from Egypt to turn the tide of the battle.<ref name=\"Saunders55\"/> The battalion-sized force was split up, with a 200-man detachment under Laycock at Souda to cover the retreat of the heavier units. Layforce and three British tanks were joined by the men of the 20th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery, who had been assigned to guard Souda docks and refused to believe that an evacuation had been ordered. After a day of battle, Laycock ordered a night retreat to Beritiana, where he was joined by Royal and the M\u0101ori, who managed to fight their way out, but Layforce was cut off near the village of Babali Khani ([[Agioi Pandes]]). Laycock and his [[brigade major]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], were able to escape in a tank. Most of the other men of the detachment and the 20th HAA Battery were killed or captured.

The German objectives in Crete were similar to the areas already being prepared by the British, but foreknowledge increased the confidence of the local commanders in their dispositions. On 14 May, London warned that the attack could come any time after 17 May, which information Freyberg passed on to the garrison.

(The real figures were 15,750 airborne troops in {{nowrap|520 aircraft}} and {{nowrap|7,000 by}} sea; late decrypts reduced uncertainty over the seaborne invasion.) The British mistakes were smaller than those of the Germans, who estimated the garrison to be only a third of the true figure.

Hinsley]], the official historian of British intelligence during the war, wrote that the Germans had more casualties in the conquest of Crete than in the rest of the Greek campaign and that the losses inflicted on the 7th ''Fliegerdivision'' were huge{{vague|date= June 2016}}. It was the only unit of its kind and was not rebuilt.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p= 84}}\n\nHinsley wrote that it was difficult to measure the influence of intelligence gained during the battle, because although Ultra revealed German situation reports, reinforcement details and unit identifications and although more intelligence was gleaned from prisoners and captured documents, it was not known how swiftly the information reached Freyberg or how he used it. The German parachute warfare manual had been captured in 1940, and after the war, Student said that he would have changed tactics had he known this. Field-signals intelligence was obtained, including bombing instructions and information from the ''Fliegerkorps'' XI tactical code. Lack of air cover prevented much British air reconnaissance north of Crete, but on 21 May signals intelligence enabled an aircraft to spot a convoy. After midnight the navy sank twelve ships and the rest scattered, which led to a second invasion convoy being called back. The second convoy was intercepted during the morning of 22 May, despite the cost to the navy of a daylight operation, and no more seaborne attempts were made.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n===Casualties===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-166-0527-22, Kreta, toter Fallschirmj\u00e4ger.jpg|thumb|A  dead German paratrooper May 1941; picture by Propaganda Kompanie 690]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-0848, Kreta, Soldatengr\u00e4ber.jpg|thumb|German soldiers pause before the graves of their comrades]]\n[[File:Maleme airfield after the Battle of Crete.jpg|thumb|Damaged and destroyed [[Junkers Ju 52]]s at [[Maleme Airfield]]]]\n[[File:Suda Bay War Cemetery.JPG|thumb|[[Souda Bay Allied War Cemetery]]]]\n[[File:Hellenic Australian Memorial Rethymno.jpg|thumb|Memorial for Greek and Australian soldiers in the centre of [[Rethymno]]]]\nOfficial German casualty figures are contradictory due to minor variations in documents produced by German commands on various dates.
