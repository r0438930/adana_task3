Coppola cited the 1966 film ''[[Blowup]]'' as a key influence. However, since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President, he felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. \n''The Conversation'' has won critical acclaim <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f92ODOjfukM 'The Conversation'|Critics' Picks|The New York Times on YouTube]</ref> and multiple accolades, including the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prix du Festival International du Film]], the highest honor at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] in 1974 and lost [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', another Francis Ford Coppola film. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nHarry Caul ([[Gene Hackman]]) is a [[surveillance]] expert who runs his own company in [[San Francisco]]. He is obsessed with his own privacy; his apartment is almost bare behind its triple-locked door and burglar alarm, he uses [[Payphone|pay phones]] to make calls, claims to have no home telephone, and his office is enclosed in wire mesh in a corner of a much larger warehouse. He has no friends, his mistress Amy knows nothing about him, and his one hobby is playing along to [[jazz]] records on a [[tenor saxophone]] in the privacy of his apartment.\n\nCaul insists that he is not responsible for the actual content of the conversations he records or the use to which his clients put his surveillance activities. However, he is racked by guilt over a past wiretap job which resulted in the murder of three people. This sense of guilt is amplified by his devout [[Catholicism]]. \n\nCaul, his colleague Stan and some freelance associates have taken on the task of bugging the conversation of a couple as they walk through crowded [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] in San Francisco, surrounded by a cacophony of background noise. Amid the small-talk, the couple discuss fears that they are being watched, and mention a discreet meeting at a hotel room in a few days. The challenging task of recording this conversation is accomplished by multiple surveillance operatives located in different positions around the square. After Caul has merged and filtered the different tapes, the final result is a sound recording in which the words themselves are clear, but their meaning remains ambiguous.\n\nWhen the client is not in his office, Caul refuses to leave the tape with the client's assistant. The assistant warns him not to get involved, telling him that the tapes are \"dangerous\". Caul feels increasingly uneasy about what may happen to the couple once the client hears the tape. He plays the tape again and again, gradually refining the recording. Using a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]], he reveals a key phrase hidden under the sound of a street musician: \"He'd ''kill'' us if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul avoids handing in the tape to the aide of the man who commissioned the surveillance. Afterward, he finds himself under increasing pressure from the client's aide and is himself followed, tricked, and bugged. The tape of the conversation is eventually stolen from him in a moment when his guard is down. He goes to the client (\"the Director\", played by [[Robert Duvall]]) to find he has received the tapes, and learns that the woman in the recording is the client's wife, apparently having an affair with the other man in the tapes. \n\nCaul books a hotel room next to one mentioned in the recording of the conversation. He uses equipment to overhear the client in a heated argument with his wife. When he goes to the balcony to watch the events through the windows out of curiosity, he sees what he believes to be the wife being murdered and retreats in shock.\n\nCaul later attempts to confront the client, but the client is absent. While departing, Caul catches sight of the wife, alive and unharmed, in a limo. He learns that his client was killed in an \"accident,\" and discovers the truth: the couple were talking about killing the woman's husband, and the murder Caul witnessed was actually that of his client and not the wife. It is revealed to the viewer that the man in the recording actually said, \"He'd kill ''us'' if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul gets a phone call from his client's assistant, who tells him not to look any further into the matter, and says, \"We'll be listening to you.\" Caul goes on a frantic search for a listening device, tearing up his apartment, to no avail. He sits amid the wreckage, playing the only thing in his apartment left intact: his saxophone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Gene Hackman]] as Harry Caul\n*[[John Cazale]] as Stan\n*[[Allen Garfield]] as William P. \"Bernie\" Moran\n*[[Cindy Williams]] as Ann\n*[[Frederic Forrest]] as Mark\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as Martin Stett\n*[[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Paul\n*[[Elizabeth MacRae]] as Meredith\n*[[Teri Garr]] as Amy Fredericks\n*Mark Wheeler as Receptionist\n*[[Shields and Yarnell|Robert Shields]] as The Mime\n*Phoebe Alexander as Lurleen\n*[[Robert Duvall]] as The Director<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/02/26/the_conversation_1974_review.shtml |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Hilditch |first=Nick |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCoppola has cited [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) as a key influence on his conceptualization of the film's themes, such as surveillance versus participation, and perception versus reality. \"Francis had seen [it] a year or two before, and had the idea to fuse the concept of ''Blowup'' with the world of audio surveillance.\"{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=152}}\n\nOn the [[DVD]] commentary, Coppola says he was shocked to learn that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon Administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola has said this is the reason the film gained part of the recognition it has received, but that this is entirely coincidental. Not only was the script for ''The Conversation'' completed in the mid-1960s (before the Nixon Administration came to power) but the spying equipment used in the film was discovered through research and the use of technical advisers and not, as many believed, by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. Coppola also noted that filming of ''The Conversation'' had been completed several months before the most revelatory Watergate stories broke in the press. Since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President, Coppola felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out.\n\nThe original cinematographer of ''The Conversation'' was [[Haskell Wexler]]. Severe creative and personal differences with Coppola led to Wexler's firing shortly after production began and Coppola replaced him with [[Bill Butler (cinematographer)|Bill Butler]]. Wexler's footage on ''The Conversation'' was completely reshot, except for the technically complex surveillance scene in Union Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/71469/The-Conversation/articles.html |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Stafford |first=Jeff |date= |accessdate=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> This would be the first of two Oscar-nominated films where Wexler would be fired and replaced by Butler, the second being ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975), where Wexler had similar problems with [[Milo\u0161 Forman]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Townsend |first=Sylvia |title=Haskell Wexler and the Making of \u2018One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u2019 |date=19 December 2014 |url=http://worldcinemaparadise.com/2014/12/19/haskell-wexler-and-the-making-of-one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest/ |accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Murch]] served as the supervising editor and sound designer. Murch had more or less a free hand during the editing process, since Coppola was already working on ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' at the time.{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=157}} Coppola noted in the DVD commentary that Hackman had a very difficult time adapting to the Harry Caul character because it was so much unlike himself. Coppola says that Hackman was at the time an outgoing and approachable person who preferred casual clothes, whereas Caul was meant to be a socially awkward loner who wore a rain coat and out-of-style glasses. Coppola said that Hackman's efforts to tap into the character made the actor moody and irritable on-set but otherwise Coppola got along well with his leading man. Coppola also notes on the commentary that Hackman considers this one of his favorite performances.\n\n''The Conversation'' features a piano score composed and performed by [[David Shire]]. The score was created before the film was shot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/soundtracks/database/?id=2939 |title=discussion of soundtrack |accessdate=22 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020115151208/http://www.soundtrack.net/soundtracks/database/?id=2939 |archivedate=15 January 2002}}</ref> On some cues, Shire used [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, taking the taped sounds of the piano and distorting them in different ways to create alternative tonalities to round out the score. The score was released on CD by [[Intrada Records]] in [[2001 in music|2001]].<ref>Intrada Special Collection Volume 2</ref>\n\n===Inspiration===\nThe character of Harry Caul was inspired by surveillance technology expert Martin Kaiser, who also served as a technical consultant on the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0435187/bio |title=Martin Kaiser |website=IMDb |accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.martykaiser.com/odyssey2.htm |title=Odyssey of an Eavesdropper |author1=Martin Kaiser |author2=Bob Stokes |website=Martykaiser.com |accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kaiser, the final scene of the film\u2014in which Caul is convinced he is being eavesdropped in his apartment, cannot find the listening device, and consoles himself by playing his saxophone\u2014was inspired by the passive [[covert listening device]]s created by [[L\u00e9on Theremin]], such as [[The Thing (listening device)|the Great Seal bug]]. \"He couldn't find out where [the bug] was because it was the instrument itself.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb-bdHGBcUY#t=45m00s |title=The Last HOPE: TSCM - A Brief Primer on Electronic Surveillance and \"Bug\" Detection (Complete) |last=GBPPR2 |date=22 September 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2017 |via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film had a $1,600,000 [[film budgeting|budget]] and grossed $4,420,000 domestically.\n\n===Critical response===\nAccording to the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 98% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 54 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 8.71/10.

After Caul has merged and filtered the different tapes, the final result is a sound recording in which the words themselves are clear, but their meaning remains ambiguous.\n\nWhen the client is not in his office, Caul refuses to leave the tape with the client's assistant. The assistant warns him not to get involved, telling him that the tapes are \"dangerous\". Caul feels increasingly uneasy about what may happen to the couple once the client hears the tape. He plays the tape again and again, gradually refining the recording. Using a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]], he reveals a key phrase hidden under the sound of a street musician: \"He'd ''kill'' us if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul avoids handing in the tape to the aide of the man who commissioned the surveillance. Afterward, he finds himself under increasing pressure from the client's aide and is himself followed, tricked, and bugged. The tape of the conversation is eventually stolen from him in a moment when his guard is down. He goes to the client (\"the Director\", played by [[Robert Duvall]]) to find he has received the tapes, and learns that the woman in the recording is the client's wife, apparently having an affair with the other man in the tapes. \n\nCaul books a hotel room next to one mentioned in the recording of the conversation. He uses equipment to overhear the client in a heated argument with his wife. When he goes to the balcony to watch the events through the windows out of curiosity, he sees what he believes to be the wife being murdered and retreats in shock.\n\nCaul later attempts to confront the client, but the client is absent. While departing, Caul catches sight of the wife, alive and unharmed, in a limo. He learns that his client was killed in an \"accident,\" and discovers the truth: the couple were talking about killing the woman's husband, and the murder Caul witnessed was actually that of his client and not the wife. It is revealed to the viewer that the man in the recording actually said, \"He'd kill ''us'' if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul gets a phone call from his client's assistant, who tells him not to look any further into the matter, and says, \"We'll be listening to you.\" Caul goes on a frantic search for a listening device, tearing up his apartment, to no avail. He sits amid the wreckage, playing the only thing in his apartment left intact: his saxophone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Gene Hackman]] as Harry Caul\n*[[John Cazale]] as Stan\n*[[Allen Garfield]] as William P. \"Bernie\" Moran\n*[[Cindy Williams]] as Ann\n*[[Frederic Forrest]] as Mark\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as Martin Stett\n*[[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Paul\n*[[Elizabeth MacRae]] as Meredith\n*[[Teri Garr]] as Amy Fredericks\n*Mark Wheeler as Receptionist\n*[[Shields and Yarnell|Robert Shields]] as The Mime\n*Phoebe Alexander as Lurleen\n*[[Robert Duvall]] as The Director<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/02/26/the_conversation_1974_review.shtml |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Hilditch |first=Nick |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCoppola has cited [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) as a key influence on his conceptualization of the film's themes, such as surveillance versus participation, and perception versus reality. \"Francis had seen [it] a year or two before, and had the idea to fuse the concept of ''Blowup'' with the world of audio surveillance.\"{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=152}}\n\nOn the [[DVD]] commentary, Coppola says he was shocked to learn that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon Administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola has said this is the reason the film gained part of the recognition it has received, but that this is entirely coincidental. Not only was the script for ''The Conversation'' completed in the mid-1960s (before the Nixon Administration came to power) but the spying equipment used in the film was discovered through research and the use of technical advisers and not, as many believed, by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. Coppola also noted that filming of ''The Conversation'' had been completed several months before the most revelatory Watergate stories broke in the press. Since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President, Coppola felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out.\n\nThe original cinematographer of ''The Conversation'' was [[Haskell Wexler]]. Severe creative and personal differences with Coppola led to Wexler's firing shortly after production began and Coppola replaced him with [[Bill Butler (cinematographer)|Bill Butler]]. Wexler's footage on ''The Conversation'' was completely reshot, except for the technically complex surveillance scene in Union Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/71469/The-Conversation/articles.html |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Stafford |first=Jeff |date= |accessdate=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> This would be the first of two Oscar-nominated films where Wexler would be fired and replaced by Butler, the second being ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975), where Wexler had similar problems with [[Milo\u0161 Forman]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Townsend |first=Sylvia |title=Haskell Wexler and the Making of \u2018One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u2019 |date=19 December 2014 |url=http://worldcinemaparadise.com/2014/12/19/haskell-wexler-and-the-making-of-one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest/ |accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Murch]] served as the supervising editor and sound designer. Murch had more or less a free hand during the editing process, since Coppola was already working on ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' at the time.{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=157}} Coppola noted in the DVD commentary that Hackman had a very difficult time adapting to the Harry Caul character because it was so much unlike himself. Coppola says that Hackman was at the time an outgoing and approachable person who preferred casual clothes, whereas Caul was meant to be a socially awkward loner who wore a rain coat and out-of-style glasses. Coppola said that Hackman's efforts to tap into the character made the actor moody and irritable on-set but otherwise Coppola got along well with his leading man. Coppola also notes on the commentary that Hackman considers this one of his favorite performances.\n\n''The Conversation'' features a piano score composed and performed by [[David Shire]]. The score was created before the film was shot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/soundtracks/database/?id=2939 |title=discussion of soundtrack |accessdate=22 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020115151208/http://www.soundtrack.net/soundtracks/database/?id=2939 |archivedate=15 January 2002}}</ref> On some cues, Shire used [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, taking the taped sounds of the piano and distorting them in different ways to create alternative tonalities to round out the score.
