He is perhaps most famous for being the first writer in Latin known to use the term ''trinity'' (Latin: ''trinitas'').  \n\nUnlike many [[Church fathers]], Tertullian was never recognized as a [[Saint#Christianity|saint]] by the Eastern or Western [[Four Marks of the Church#Catholic|catholic]] tradition churches. Several of his teachings on issues such as the clear subordination of the Son and Spirit to the Father,<ref name=\"stanford\">{{cite web|authors=Tuggy, Dale & Zalta, Edward N.

Roman Africa was famous as the home of orators, and this influence can be seen in his writing style with its archaisms or provincialisms, its glowing imagery and its passionate temper.  He was a scholar with an excellent education. He wrote at least three books in Greek. In them he refers to himself, but none of these is extant.\n\nAccording to church tradition, Tertullian was raised in Carthage<ref name =\"Oxford\">{{cite book| editor-last =Cross | editor-first = F. L. |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2005}}</ref> and was thought to be the son of a Roman centurion; Tertullian has been claimed to have been a trained lawyer and an ordained priest. These assertions rely on the accounts of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius) |Church History]]'', II, ii. 4, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]'' (''On famous men'') chapter 53.{{efn|See introduction to {{harv |Barnes|1971}}; however Barnes retracted some of his positions in the 1985 revised edition.}} Jerome claimed that Tertullian's father held the position of ''centurio proconsularis'' (\"aide-de-camp\") in the [[Roman army]] in Africa.<ref>[[Jerome]], 'Chronicon' 16.23-4</ref> \n\nFurther, Tertullian has been thought to be a lawyer based on his use of legal analogies and an identification of him with the jurist Tertullianus, who is quoted in the ''[[Pandects]]''. Although Tertullian used a knowledge of Roman law in his writings, his legal knowledge does not demonstrably exceed that of what could be expected from a sufficient Roman education.{{sfn|Barnes|1971|p=24, 27}} The writings of Tertullianus, a lawyer of the same ''[[cognomen]],'' exist only in fragments and do not explicitly denote a Christian authorship. Finally, any notion of Tertullian being a priest is also questionable. In his extant writings, he never describes himself as ordained{{sfn|Barnes|1971|p=11}} in the church and seems to place himself among the laity.<ref>Tertullian, De Exhortatione Castitatis 7.3 and De Monogamia 12.2</ref>\n\nHis conversion to Christianity perhaps took place about 197\u2013198 (cf. [[Adolf Harnack]], [[Bonwetsch]], and others), but its immediate antecedents are unknown except as they are conjectured from his writings. The event must have been sudden and decisive, transforming at once his own personality. He writes that he could not imagine a truly Christian life without such a conscious breach, a radical act of conversion: \"Christians are made, not born\" (''Apol.'', xviii). Two books addressed to his wife confirm that he was married to a Christian wife.<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Written to His Wife|website=newadvent.org|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0404.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304214727/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0404.htm|archivedate=2014-03-04}}</ref>\n\nIn middle life (about 207), he was attracted to the \"New Prophecy\" of [[Montanism]], though today most scholars reject the assertion that Tertullian left the mainstream Church or was excommunicated.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=tXnQjPvrDZUC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=%22overwhelming+consensus+that+Tertullian+was+not+a+Montanist+schismatic%22#v=onepage&q=%22overwhelming%20consensus%20that%20Tertullian%20was%20not%20a%20Montanist%20schismatic%22&f=false\n | title=Tertullian and Paul| isbn=9780567554116| last1=Still| first1=Todd D| last2=Wilhite| first2=David E| date=2012-12-20}}</ref> \"[W]e are left to ask whether [Saint] Cyprian could have regarded Tertullian as his master if Tertullian had been a notorious schismatic.

By the doctrinal works he published, Tertullian became the teacher of [[Cyprian]] and the predecessor of Augustine, who, in turn, became the chief founder of Latin theology.\n\n== Writings ==\n\n=== General character ===\nThirty-one works are extant, together with fragments of more. Some fifteen works in Latin or Greek are lost, some as recently as the 9th century (''De Paradiso, De superstitione saeculi, De carne et anima'' were all extant in the now damaged [[Codex Agobardinus]] in 814 AD). Tertullian's writings cover the whole theological field of the time\u2014[[apologetics]] against paganism and Judaism, [[polemic]]s, polity, discipline, and morals, or the whole reorganization of human life on a Christian basis; they gave a picture of the religious life and thought of the time which is of great interest to the church historian.\n\nLike other early [[Christianity|Christian]] writers Tertullian used the term ''paganus'' to mean \"civilian\" as a contrast to the \"soldiers of Christ\".<ref>Ernest Weekley, ''Etymological Dictionary of English'', s.v. \"pagan\".</ref> The motif of [[Miles Christianus|Miles Christi]] did not assume the literal meaning of participation in war until Church doctrines justifying Christian participation in battle were developed around the 5th century.<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 1449-9320| volume = 8| issue = Journal Article| pages = 77\u2013| last = Iwanczak| first = Wojciech| title = Miles Christi: the medieval ideal of knighthood| journal = Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association| date = 2012| url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&sw=w&u=wikipedia&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA454359740&asid=b7bcab1e0aab147ff62b696318501ae7}}</ref> In the 2nd century writings of Tertullian ''paganus'' meant a \"civilian\" who was lacking self-discipline.

It is in part determined by the Montanistic views that are set forth in some of them, by the author's own allusions to ''this'' writing, or ''that,'' as antedating others (cf. Harnack, ''Litteratur'' ii.260\u2013262), and by definite historic data (e.g., the reference to the death of [[Septimius Severus]], ''Ad Scapulam'', iv). In his work against [[Marcion]], which he calls his third composition on the Marcionite heresy, he gives its date as the fifteenth year of the reign of Severus (''Adv. Marcionem'', i.1, 15)\u2014which would be approximately 208.\n\nThe writings may be divided with reference to the two periods of Tertullian's Christian activity, the mainstream and the Montanist (cf. Harnack, ii.262 sqq.), or according to their subject matter. The object of the former mode of division is to show, if possible, the change of views Tertullian's mind underwent. Following the latter mode, which is of a more practical interest, the writings fall into two groups. Apologetic and polemic writings, like ''[[Apologeticus]]'', ''De testimonio animae'', the [[anti-Judaism|anti-Jewish]] ''[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/An Answer to the Jews|De Adversus Iudaeos]]'', ''Adv. Marcionem'', ''Adv. Praxeam'', ''Adv. Hermogenem'', ''De praescriptione hereticorum'', and ''Scorpiace'' were written to counteract [[Gnosticism]] and other religious or philosophical doctrines. The other group consists of practical and disciplinary writings, e.g., ''De monogamia'', ''Ad uxorem'', ''De virginibus velandis'', ''De cultu feminarum'', ''De patientia'', ''De pudicitia'', ''De oratione'', and ''Ad martyras''.\n\nAmong his apologetic writings, the ''Apologeticus,'' addressed to the Roman magistrates, is a most pungent defense of Christianity and the Christians against the reproaches of the pagans, and an important legacy of the ancient Church, proclaiming the principle of [[freedom of religion]] as an inalienable human right and demanding a fair trial for Christians before they are condemned to death.\n\nTertullian was the first to disprove charges that Christians sacrificed infants at the [[Eucharist|celebration of the Lord's Supper]] and committed incest. He pointed to the commission of such crimes in the pagan world and then proved by the testimony of [[Pliny the Younger]] that Christians pledged themselves not to commit murder, adultery, or other crimes. He adduced the inhumanity of pagan customs such as feeding the flesh of gladiators to beasts. He argued that the gods have no existence and thus there is no pagan religion against which Christians may offend. Christians do not engage in the foolish worship of the emperors, that they do better: they pray for them, and that Christians can afford to be put to torture and to death, and the more they are cast down the more they grow; \"the blood of the [[martyr]]s is seed\" (''Apologeticum'', 50). In the ''De Praescriptione'' he develops as its fundamental idea that, in a dispute between the Church and a separating party, the whole [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies with the latter, as the Church, in possession of the unbroken tradition, is by its very existence a guarantee of its truth.\n\nThe five books against Marcion, written in 207 or 208, are the most comprehensive and elaborate of his polemical works, invaluable for gauging the early Christian view of Gnosticism. Tertullian has been identified by Jo Ann McNamara as the person who originally invested the consecrated virgin as the \u201cbride of Christ\u201d which helped to bring the independent virgin under patriarchal rule.{{sfn|Bitel|2008|p=17}}\n\n== Theology ==\n\n=== General character ===\n{{OR section|date=August 2013}}\nThough thoroughly conversant with the Greek theology, Tertullian remained independent of its metaphysical speculations. He had learned from the Greek apologies, and offered a direct contrast to [[Origen of Alexandria]], who drew many of his theories regarding creation from [[Middle Platonism]]. Tertullian carried his [[philosophical realism|realism]] to the verge of [[materialism]]. This is evident from his ascription to God of corporeity and his acceptance of the [[Traducianism|traducian theory]] of the origin of the soul. He despised Greek philosophy, and, far from looking at [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other Greek thinkers whom he quotes as forerunners of Christ and the Gospel, he pronounces them the patriarchal forefathers of the heretics (''De anima'', iii.). He held up to scorn their inconsistency when he referred to the fact that [[Socrates]] in dying ordered a cock to be sacrificed to [[Aesculapius]] (''De anima'', i). Tertullian always wrote under stress of a felt necessity. He was never so happy as when he had opponents like [[Marcion]] and [[Praxeas]], and, however abstract the ideas may be which he treated, he was always moved by practical considerations to make his case clear and irresistible. It was partly this element which gave to his writings a formative influence upon the theology of the post-Nicene period in the West and has rendered them fresh reading to this day. Although he was by nature a polemicist, no mention is made of his name by other authors during the 3rd century. Lactantius at the opening of the 4th century is the first to do so. Augustine, however, treats him with respect. Cyprian, Tertullian's North African compatriot, though nowhere mentioning his name, was well read in his writings, according to Cyprian's secretary in a letter to Jerome.\n\n=== Specific teachings ===\nTertullian's main doctrinal teachings are as follows:\n# The soul was not preexistent, as Plato affirmed, nor subject to [[metempsychosis]] or [[reincarnation]], as the [[Pythagoreans]] held. In each individual it is a new product, proceeding equally with the body from the parents, and not created later and associated with the body (''De anima'', xxvii). This position is called [[traducianism]] in opposition to '[[Creationism (soul)|creationism]]', or the idea that each immortal spirit is a fresh creation of God.\n# The soul's sinfulness is easily explained by its [[traducian]] origin (''De anima'', xxxix). It is in bondage to [[Satan]] (whose works it renounces in baptism), but has seeds of good (''De anima'', xli), and when awakened, it passes to health and at once calls upon God (''Apol.'', xvii.) and is naturally Christian. It exists in all men alike; it is a culprit and yet an unconscious witness--by its impulse to worship, its fear of demons, and its musings on death--to the power, benignity, and judgment of God as revealed in the Christian's Scriptures (''De testimonio,'' v-vi).\n# Tertullian reserves the appellation God, in the sense of the ultimate originator of all things, to the Father,<ref name=\"stanford\"/> who made the world out of nothing through his Son, the Word, has corporeity though he is a spirit (''De praescriptione'', vii.; ''Adv. Praxeam,'' vii.). However Tertullian used 'corporeal' only in the [[stoicism|Stoic]] sense, to mean something with actual material existence, rather than the later idea of flesh. Tertullian is often considered an early proponent of the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene doctrine]], approaching the subject from the standpoint of the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos doctrine]], though he did not state the later doctrine of the [[immanent Trinity]]. In his treatise against Praxeas, who taught [[patripassianism]] in Rome, he used the words \"trinity\", \"economy\" (used in reference to the three persons), \"persons\", and \"substance,\" maintaining the distinction of the Son from the Father as the unoriginate God, and the Spirit from both the Father and the Son (''Adv. Praxeam,'' xxv). \"These three are one substance, not one person; and it is said, 'I and my Father are one' in respect not of the singularity of number but the unity of the substance.\" The very names \"Father\" and \"Son\" indicate the distinction of personality. The Father is one, the Son is another, and the Spirit is another (\"dico alium esse patrem et alium filium et alium spiritum\" ''Adv. Praxeam'', ix), and yet in defending the unity of God, he says the Son is not other (\"alius a patre filius non est\", ''Adv. Prax.'' 18) as a result of receiving a portion of the Father's substance.<ref name=\"stanford\"/> At times, speaking of the Father and the Son, Tertullian refers to \"two gods\".<ref name=\"stanford\"/>{{efn|\"Ergo, inquis, si deus dixit et deus fecit, si alius deus dixit et alius fecit, duo dii praedicantur. Si tam durus es, puta interim. Et ut adhuc amplius hoc putes, accipe et in psalmo duos deos dictos: Thronus tuus, deus, in aevum, <virga directionis> virga regni tui; dilexisti iustitiam et odisti iniquitatem, propterea unxit te deus, deus tuus.\" (\"Therefore\", thou sayest, \"if a god said and a god made, if one god said and another made, two gods are being preached.\" If thou art so hard, think a little! And that thou mayest think more fully, accept that in the Psalm two gods are spoken of: \"Thy throne, God, is for ever, a sceptre of right direction is thy sceptre; thou hast loved justice and hast hated iniquity, therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee.\" ''Adv. Prax. 13)}} He says that all things of the Father belong also to the Son, including his names, such as Almighty God, Most High, Lord of Hosts, or King of Israel.<ref>''Adv. Prax.'' 17.</ref> Though Tertullian considered the Father to be God (Yahweh), he responded to criticism of the [[Sabellianism|Modalist]] Praxeas that this meant that Tertullian's Christianity was not monotheistic by noting that even though there was one God (Yahweh, who became the Father when the Son became his agent of creation), the Son could also be referred to as God, when referred to apart from the Father, because the Son, though subordinate to God, is entitled to be called God \"from the unity of the Father\" in regards to being formed from a portion of His substance.<ref name=\"stanford\"/>{{efn|\"Si filium nolunt secundum a patre reputari ne secundus duos faciat deos dici, ostendimus etiam duos deos in scriptura relatos et duos dominos: et tamen ne de isto scandalizentur, rationem reddimus qua dei non duo dicantur nec domini sed qua pater et filius duo, et hoc non ex separatione substantiae sed ex dispositione, cum individuum et inseparatum filium a patre pronuntiamus, nec statu sed gradu alium, qui etsi deus dicatur quando nominatur singularis, non ideo duos deos faciat sed unum, hoc ipso quod et deus ex unitate patris vocari habeat.\" (If they do not wish that the Son be considered second to the Father, lest being second he cause it to be said that there are two gods, we have also showed that two gods are related in Scripture, and two lords. And yet, let them not be scandalized by this \u2013 we give a reason why there are not said to be two gods nor lords but rather two as a Father and a Son. And this not from separation of substance but from disposition, since we pronounce the Son undivided and unseparated from the Father, other not in status but in grade, who although he is said to be God when mentioned by himself, does not therefore make two gods but one, by the fact that he is also entitled to be called God from the unity of the Father. ''Adv. Prax.'' 19)}} ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' comments that for Tertullian, \"There was a time when there was no Son and no sin, when God was neither Father nor Judge.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14520c.htm|title=\"Tertullian,\" ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Princeton Theological Review 1906, pp. 56, 159\">[[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B. B. Warfield]] in ''Princeton Theological Review'', 1906, pp. 56, 159.</ref> Similarly [[J.N.D. Kelly]] has stated: \"Tertullian followed the Apologists in dating His 'perfect generation' from His extrapolation for the work of creation; prior to that moment God could not strictly be said to have had a Son, while after it the term 'Father', which for earlier theologians generally connoted God as author of reality, began to acquire the specialized meaning of Father and Son.\".<ref>J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines,'' Continual International Publishing Book, c1960, 2000, p. 112</ref>{{Verify quote|type=illogical quote|date=February 2016}} As regards the subjects of [[subordinationism|subordination]] of the Son to the Father, the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' has commented: \"In not a few areas of theology, Tertullian\u2019s views are, of course, completely unacceptable. Thus, for example, his teaching on the Trinity reveals a subordination of Son to Father that in the later crass form of [[Arianism]] the Church rejected as heretical.\"<ref name=\"lesaint\"/> Though he did not fully state the doctrine of the immanence of the Trinity, according to B. B. Warfield, he went a long distance in the way of approach to it.<ref name=\"Princeton Theological Review 1906, pp. 56, 159\"/>\n# In [[soteriology]], Tertullian does not dogmatize; he prefers to keep silence at the mystery of the cross (''De Patientia'', iii). The sufferings of Christ's life as well as of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] are efficacious to redemption. In the water of [[baptism]], which (upon a partial quotation of John 3:5) is made necessary (''De baptismo'', vi.), humans are born again; the baptized does not receive the [[Holy Spirit]] in the water, but is prepared for the Holy Spirit. Humans are little fishes\u2014after the example of the ''[[ichthys]]'', fish, Jesus Christ\u2014are born in water (''De baptismo'', i). In discussing whether sins committed subsequent to baptism may be forgiven, Tertullian calls baptism and [[penance]] \"two planks\" on which the sinner may be saved from shipwreck\u2014language which he gave to the Church (''De penitentia'', xii).\n# With reference to the '[[rule of faith]]', it may be said that Tertullian is constantly using this expression, and by it means ''now'' the authoritative tradition handed down in the Church, ''now'' the Scriptures themselves, and, ''perhaps'', a definite doctrinal formula. While he nowhere gives a list of the books of Scripture, he divides them into two parts and calls them the ''instrumentum '' and ''testamentum'' (''Adv. Marcionem'', iv.1). He distinguishes between the [[four Gospels]] and insists upon their apostolic origin as accrediting their authority (''De praescriptione'', xxxvi; ''Adv. Marcionem'', iv.1\u20135); in trying to account for Marcion's treatment of the Lucan Gospel and the Pauline writings he sarcastically queries whether the \"shipmaster from Pontus\" (Marcion) had ever been guilty of taking on contraband goods or tampering with them after they were aboard (''Adv. Marcionem'', v.1). The Scripture, the rule of faith, is for him fixed and authoritative (''De corona'', iii-iv). As opposed to the pagan writings they are divine (''De testimonio animae'', vi). They contain all truth (''De praescriptione'', vii, xiv) and from them the Church drinks (''potat'') her faith (''Adv. Praxeam'', xiii). The prophets were older than the Greek philosophers and their authority is accredited by the fulfilment of their predictions (''Apol.'', xix-xx). The Scriptures and the teachings of philosophy are incompatible, insofar as the latter are the origins of sub-Christian heresies. \"What has [[Athens]] to do with [[Jerusalem]]?\" he exclaims, \"or the Academy with the Church?\" (''De praescriptione'', vii). Philosophy as pop-paganism is a work of demons (''De anima'', i); the Scriptures contain the wisdom of heaven. However, Tertullian was not averse to using the technical methods of [[Stoicism]] to discuss a problem (''De anima''). The rule of faith, however, seems to be also applied by Tertullian to some distinct formula of doctrine, and he gives a succinct statement of the Christian faith under this term (''De praescriptione'', xiii).\n# Tertullian was a defender of the necessity of apostolicity. In his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', he explicitly challenges heretics to produce evidence of the [[apostolic succession]] of their communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm|title=The Prescription against Heretics: Chapter 32|publisher=}}</ref> \"Let them produce the original records of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [that first bishop of theirs] bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or of apostolic men\u2014a man, moreover, who continued steadfast with the apostles. For this is the manner in which the apostolic churches transmit their registers: as the [[Metropolis of Smyrna|church of Smyrna]], which records that [[Polycarp]] was placed therein by [[John the Apostle|John]]; as also the church of Rome, which makes [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] to have been ordained in like manner by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. In exactly the same way the other churches likewise exhibit (their several worthies), whom, as having been appointed to their episcopal places by apostles, they regard as transmitters of the apostolic seed.\"\n# [[Fornication|Fornicators]] and [[murder]]ers should never be readmitted into the church under any circumstances. In ''De pudicitia'', Tertullian condemns Pope [[Callixtus I]] for allowing such people to be readmitted if they show repentance.\n\n===Eschatology===\n;Resurrection at the Second Coming\nTertullian was a [[Premillennialism|premillennialist]], affirming a literal resurrection at the second advent of Jesus at the end of the world, not at death.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=255\u2013256}}\n;Jesus, the stone that strikes and destroys the image\nConcerning the image prophecy of [[Daniel 2]], Tertullian identified Jesus, at his second advent, as the stone cut out of a mountain that strikes and destroys the image of \"secular kingdoms\". He compares this with [[Daniel 7]], 'Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; and they brought Him before Him, and there was given Him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.\"<ref>Tertulian, Against Marcion, chap. 7, in ANF, Vol. 3, p. 326</ref>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=256}}\n;Antichrist is the Beast \nLike [[Irenaeus]], Tertullian equated the [[Antichrist]] with the '\"Man of Sin\" and the \"Beast\". He expected a specific Antichrist to appear as a persecutor of the church just before the resurrection, under whom a second company of martyrs will be slain. Unlike Irenaeus, however, Tertullian does not consider the Antichrist to be a Jew sitting in a Jewish temple at Jerusalem. Rather, the Antichrist comes out of the church.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=257}}\n;Rome symbolized as Babylon\nTertullian applied the biblical figure of [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]] to the city of Rome and her domination. He portrayed Rome as drunk with the blood of martyred saints.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=258}}\n;Order of Last Days events\nThe order of Last Days events, according to Tertullian, are the plagues, Babylon's doom, Antichrist's warfare on the saints, the devil cast into the bottomless pit, the Advent, the resurrection of the saints, the Judgment, and the Second Resurrection, with the harvest at the end of the World; and the sixth seal extending to the final dissolution of the earth and sky, including the stars.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=258\u2013259}}\n;Millennium follows resurrection of the righteous dead\nTertullian maintained that the thousand years of Revelation will follow the resurrection of the righteous dead on the earth with the [[New Jerusalem]], proceeding the eternity of heaven. The earth is destroyed after the one thousand years and the saints moved to the kingdom of heaven.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=259\u2013260}}\n;Seventy weeks fulfilled by First Advent\nTertullian contended that Daniel's [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|seventy weeks]] foretold the time of Christ's incarnation and death. He started the seventy weeks from the first year of [[Darius the Mede|Darius]], and continued to Jerusalem's destruction by the Romans under the command of Titus, fully completing the vision and prophecy.  It is sealed by the advent of Christ, which he places at the end of the sixty-two and one-half weeks.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=260\u2013261}}\n\n== Moral principles ==\n{{OR section|date=July 2015}}\nTertullian was a determined advocate of strict discipline and an austere code of practise, and like many of the African fathers, one of the leading representatives of the rigorist element in the early Church. These views may have led him to adopt [[Montanism]] with its ascetic [[rigor]] and its belief in [[chiliasm]] and the continuance of the prophetic gifts. In his writings on public amusements, the veiling of virgins, the conduct of women, and the like, he gives expression to these views.\n\nOn the principle that we should not look at or listen to what we have no right to practise, and that polluted things, seen and touched, pollute (''De spectaculis'', viii, xvii), he declared a Christian should abstain from the theater and the amphitheater. There pagan religious rites were applied and the names of pagan divinities invoked; there the precepts of modesty, purity, and humanity were ignored or set aside, and there no place was offered to the onlookers for the cultivation of the Christian graces. Women should put aside their gold and precious stones as ornaments,<ref>''De cultu'', v-vi</ref> and virgins should conform to the law of St. Paul for women and keep themselves strictly veiled (''De virginibus velandis''). He praised the unmarried state as the highest (''De monogamia'', xvii; ''Ad uxorem'', i.3) and called upon Christians not to allow themselves to be excelled in the virtue of celibacy by [[Vestal Virgin]]s and Egyptian priests. He even labeled second marriage a species of adultery (''De exhortationis castitatis'', ix), but this directly contradicted the Epistles of the [[Apostle Paul]]. Tertullian's resolve to never marry again and that no one else should remarry eventually led to his break with Rome because the orthodox church refused to follow him in this resolve. He, instead, favored the Montanist sect where they also condemned second marriage.{{sfn|Bitel|2008|p=21}} One reason for Tertullian's disdain for marriage was his belief about the transformation that awaited a married couple. He believed that marital relations coarsened the body and the soul and would dull their spiritual senses and avert the Holy Spirit since husband and wife became one flesh once married.{{sfn|Bitel|2008|p=17}}\n\nTertullian is sometimes criticized for being [[misogynistic]], on the basis of the contents of his ''De Cultu Feminarum,'' section I.I, part 2 (trans. C.W. Marx):{{cn|date=January 2017}} \"Do you not know that you are [[Eve]]? The judgment of God upon this sex lives on in this age; therefore, necessarily the guilt should live on also. \nYou are the gateway of the devil; you are the one who unseals the curse of that tree, and you are the first one to turn your back on the divine law; you are the one who persuaded him whom the devil was not capable of corrupting; you easily destroyed the image of God, [[Adam]]. Because of what you deserve, that is, death, even the Son of God had to die.\"\n\nTertullian had a radical view on the cosmos. He believed that heaven and earth intersected at many points and that it was possible that sexual relations with supernatural beings can occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1715.asp |title=Scholar Discusses the 'Bride of Christ' in the Early Church |website=Fordham.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118102358/https://legacy.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1715.asp |archivedate=November 18, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Septimi Florensis Tertulliani Opera.tif|thumb|''Septimi Florensis Tertulliani Opera'' (1598)]]\n{{Wikisource author}}\nTertullian's writings are edited in volumes 1\u20132 of the ''[[Patrologia Latina]],'' and modern texts exist in the ''[[Corpus Christianorum Latinorum]].''

Perpetuae et Felicitatis'' (Martyrdom of SS. Perpetua and Felicitas), much of it the personal diary of St. [[Perpetua]], was once assumed to have been edited by Tertullian. That view is no longer held, and it is usually published separately from Tertullian's works.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Christian pacifism]]\n* [[Septimia (gens)]]\n* [[Pseudo-Tertullian]]\n* [[Tertulia]]\n* [[Descriptions in antiquity of the execution cross]]\n* [[List of Christian women of the patristic age]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Timothy|title=Tertullian: A literary and historical study|publisher= Oxford|year= 1971|edition= Reprinted with appendix of revisions 1985|url=https://archive.org/details/tertullianhistor0000barn|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0198143628|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|authors= Bitel, Lisa M.

Roman Africa was famous as the home of orators, and this influence can be seen in his writing style with its archaisms or provincialisms, its glowing imagery and its passionate temper.  He was a scholar with an excellent education. He wrote at least three books in Greek. In them he refers to himself, but none of these is extant.\n\nAccording to church tradition, Tertullian was raised in Carthage<ref name =\"Oxford\">{{cite book| editor-last =Cross | editor-first = F. L. |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2005}}</ref> and was thought to be the son of a Roman centurion; Tertullian has been claimed to have been a trained lawyer and an ordained priest. These assertions rely on the accounts of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius) |Church History]]'', II, ii. 4, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]'' (''On famous men'') chapter 53.{{efn|See introduction to {{harv |Barnes|1971}}; however Barnes retracted some of his positions in the 1985 revised edition.}} Jerome claimed that Tertullian's father held the position of ''centurio proconsularis'' (\"aide-de-camp\") in the [[Roman army]] in Africa.<ref>[[Jerome]], 'Chronicon' 16.23-4</ref> \n\nFurther, Tertullian has been thought to be a lawyer based on his use of legal analogies and an identification of him with the jurist Tertullianus, who is quoted in the ''[[Pandects]]''. Although Tertullian used a knowledge of Roman law in his writings, his legal knowledge does not demonstrably exceed that of what could be expected from a sufficient Roman education.{{sfn|Barnes|1971|p=24, 27}} The writings of Tertullianus, a lawyer of the same ''[[cognomen]],'' exist only in fragments and do not explicitly denote a Christian authorship. Finally, any notion of Tertullian being a priest is also questionable. In his extant writings, he never describes himself as ordained{{sfn|Barnes|1971|p=11}} in the church and seems to place himself among the laity.<ref>Tertullian, De Exhortatione Castitatis 7.3 and De Monogamia 12.2</ref>\n\nHis conversion to Christianity perhaps took place about 197\u2013198 (cf. [[Adolf Harnack]], [[Bonwetsch]], and others), but its immediate antecedents are unknown except as they are conjectured from his writings. The event must have been sudden and decisive, transforming at once his own personality. He writes that he could not imagine a truly Christian life without such a conscious breach, a radical act of conversion: \"Christians are made, not born\" (''Apol.'', xviii). Two books addressed to his wife confirm that he was married to a Christian wife.<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Written to His Wife|website=newadvent.org|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0404.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304214727/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0404.htm|archivedate=2014-03-04}}</ref>\n\nIn middle life (about 207), he was attracted to the \"New Prophecy\" of [[Montanism]], though today most scholars reject the assertion that Tertullian left the mainstream Church or was excommunicated.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=tXnQjPvrDZUC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=%22overwhelming+consensus+that+Tertullian+was+not+a+Montanist+schismatic%22#v=onepage&q=%22overwhelming%20consensus%20that%20Tertullian%20was%20not%20a%20Montanist%20schismatic%22&f=false\n | title=Tertullian and Paul| isbn=9780567554116| last1=Still| first1=Todd D| last2=Wilhite| first2=David E| date=2012-12-20}}</ref> \"[W]e are left to ask whether [Saint] Cyprian could have regarded Tertullian as his master if Tertullian had been a notorious schismatic.

By the doctrinal works he published, Tertullian became the teacher of [[Cyprian]] and the predecessor of Augustine, who, in turn, became the chief founder of Latin theology.\n\n== Writings ==\n\n=== General character ===\nThirty-one works are extant, together with fragments of more. Some fifteen works in Latin or Greek are lost, some as recently as the 9th century (''De Paradiso, De superstitione saeculi, De carne et anima'' were all extant in the now damaged [[Codex Agobardinus]] in 814 AD). Tertullian's writings cover the whole theological field of the time\u2014[[apologetics]] against paganism and Judaism, [[polemic]]s, polity, discipline, and morals, or the whole reorganization of human life on a Christian basis; they gave a picture of the religious life and thought of the time which is of great interest to the church historian.\n\nLike other early [[Christianity|Christian]] writers Tertullian used the term ''paganus'' to mean \"civilian\" as a contrast to the \"soldiers of Christ\".<ref>Ernest Weekley, ''Etymological Dictionary of English'', s.v. \"pagan\".</ref> The motif of [[Miles Christianus|Miles Christi]] did not assume the literal meaning of participation in war until Church doctrines justifying Christian participation in battle were developed around the 5th century.<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 1449-9320| volume = 8| issue = Journal Article| pages = 77\u2013| last = Iwanczak| first = Wojciech| title = Miles Christi: the medieval ideal of knighthood| journal = Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association| date = 2012| url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&sw=w&u=wikipedia&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA454359740&asid=b7bcab1e0aab147ff62b696318501ae7}}</ref> In the 2nd century writings of Tertullian ''paganus'' meant a \"civilian\" who was lacking self-discipline.

It is in part determined by the Montanistic views that are set forth in some of them, by the author's own allusions to ''this'' writing, or ''that,'' as antedating others (cf. Harnack, ''Litteratur'' ii.260\u2013262), and by definite historic data (e.g., the reference to the death of [[Septimius Severus]], ''Ad Scapulam'', iv). In his work against [[Marcion]], which he calls his third composition on the Marcionite heresy, he gives its date as the fifteenth year of the reign of Severus (''Adv. Marcionem'', i.1, 15)\u2014which would be approximately 208.\n\nThe writings may be divided with reference to the two periods of Tertullian's Christian activity, the mainstream and the Montanist (cf. Harnack, ii.262 sqq.), or according to their subject matter. The object of the former mode of division is to show, if possible, the change of views Tertullian's mind underwent. Following the latter mode, which is of a more practical interest, the writings fall into two groups. Apologetic and polemic writings, like ''[[Apologeticus]]'', ''De testimonio animae'', the [[anti-Judaism|anti-Jewish]] ''[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/An Answer to the Jews|De Adversus Iudaeos]]'', ''Adv. Marcionem'', ''Adv. Praxeam'', ''Adv. Hermogenem'', ''De praescriptione hereticorum'', and ''Scorpiace'' were written to counteract [[Gnosticism]] and other religious or philosophical doctrines. The other group consists of practical and disciplinary writings, e.g., ''De monogamia'', ''Ad uxorem'', ''De virginibus velandis'', ''De cultu feminarum'', ''De patientia'', ''De pudicitia'', ''De oratione'', and ''Ad martyras''.\n\nAmong his apologetic writings, the ''Apologeticus,'' addressed to the Roman magistrates, is a most pungent defense of Christianity and the Christians against the reproaches of the pagans, and an important legacy of the ancient Church, proclaiming the principle of [[freedom of religion]] as an inalienable human right and demanding a fair trial for Christians before they are condemned to death.\n\nTertullian was the first to disprove charges that Christians sacrificed infants at the [[Eucharist|celebration of the Lord's Supper]] and committed incest. He pointed to the commission of such crimes in the pagan world and then proved by the testimony of [[Pliny the Younger]] that Christians pledged themselves not to commit murder, adultery, or other crimes. He adduced the inhumanity of pagan customs such as feeding the flesh of gladiators to beasts. He argued that the gods have no existence and thus there is no pagan religion against which Christians may offend. Christians do not engage in the foolish worship of the emperors, that they do better: they pray for them, and that Christians can afford to be put to torture and to death, and the more they are cast down the more they grow; \"the blood of the [[martyr]]s is seed\" (''Apologeticum'', 50). In the ''De Praescriptione'' he develops as its fundamental idea that, in a dispute between the Church and a separating party, the whole [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies with the latter, as the Church, in possession of the unbroken tradition, is by its very existence a guarantee of its truth.\n\nThe five books against Marcion, written in 207 or 208, are the most comprehensive and elaborate of his polemical works, invaluable for gauging the early Christian view of Gnosticism. Tertullian has been identified by Jo Ann McNamara as the person who originally invested the consecrated virgin as the \u201cbride of Christ\u201d which helped to bring the independent virgin under patriarchal rule.{{sfn|Bitel|2008|p=17}}\n\n== Theology ==\n\n=== General character ===\n{{OR section|date=August 2013}}\nThough thoroughly conversant with the Greek theology, Tertullian remained independent of its metaphysical speculations. He had learned from the Greek apologies, and offered a direct contrast to [[Origen of Alexandria]], who drew many of his theories regarding creation from [[Middle Platonism]]. Tertullian carried his [[philosophical realism|realism]] to the verge of [[materialism]]. This is evident from his ascription to God of corporeity and his acceptance of the [[Traducianism|traducian theory]] of the origin of the soul. He despised Greek philosophy, and, far from looking at [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other Greek thinkers whom he quotes as forerunners of Christ and the Gospel, he pronounces them the patriarchal forefathers of the heretics (''De anima'', iii.). He held up to scorn their inconsistency when he referred to the fact that [[Socrates]] in dying ordered a cock to be sacrificed to [[Aesculapius]] (''De anima'', i). Tertullian always wrote under stress of a felt necessity. He was never so happy as when he had opponents like [[Marcion]] and [[Praxeas]], and, however abstract the ideas may be which he treated, he was always moved by practical considerations to make his case clear and irresistible. It was partly this element which gave to his writings a formative influence upon the theology of the post-Nicene period in the West and has rendered them fresh reading to this day. Although he was by nature a polemicist, no mention is made of his name by other authors during the 3rd century. Lactantius at the opening of the 4th century is the first to do so. Augustine, however, treats him with respect. Cyprian, Tertullian's North African compatriot, though nowhere mentioning his name, was well read in his writings, according to Cyprian's secretary in a letter to Jerome.\n\n=== Specific teachings ===\nTertullian's main doctrinal teachings are as follows:\n# The soul was not preexistent, as Plato affirmed, nor subject to [[metempsychosis]] or [[reincarnation]], as the [[Pythagoreans]] held. In each individual it is a new product, proceeding equally with the body from the parents, and not created later and associated with the body (''De anima'', xxvii). This position is called [[traducianism]] in opposition to '[[Creationism (soul)|creationism]]', or the idea that each immortal spirit is a fresh creation of God.\n# The soul's sinfulness is easily explained by its [[traducian]] origin (''De anima'', xxxix). It is in bondage to [[Satan]] (whose works it renounces in baptism), but has seeds of good (''De anima'', xli), and when awakened, it passes to health and at once calls upon God (''Apol.'', xvii.) and is naturally Christian. It exists in all men alike; it is a culprit and yet an unconscious witness--by its impulse to worship, its fear of demons, and its musings on death--to the power, benignity, and judgment of God as revealed in the Christian's Scriptures (''De testimonio,'' v-vi).\n# Tertullian reserves the appellation God, in the sense of the ultimate originator of all things, to the Father,<ref name=\"stanford\"/> who made the world out of nothing through his Son, the Word, has corporeity though he is a spirit (''De praescriptione'', vii.; ''Adv. Praxeam,'' vii.). However Tertullian used 'corporeal' only in the [[stoicism|Stoic]] sense, to mean something with actual material existence, rather than the later idea of flesh. Tertullian is often considered an early proponent of the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene doctrine]], approaching the subject from the standpoint of the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos doctrine]], though he did not state the later doctrine of the [[immanent Trinity]]. In his treatise against Praxeas, who taught [[patripassianism]] in Rome, he used the words \"trinity\", \"economy\" (used in reference to the three persons), \"persons\", and \"substance,\" maintaining the distinction of the Son from the Father as the unoriginate God, and the Spirit from both the Father and the Son (''Adv. Praxeam,'' xxv). \"These three are one substance, not one person; and it is said, 'I and my Father are one' in respect not of the singularity of number but the unity of the substance.\" The very names \"Father\" and \"Son\" indicate the distinction of personality. The Father is one, the Son is another, and the Spirit is another (\"dico alium esse patrem et alium filium et alium spiritum\" ''Adv. Praxeam'', ix), and yet in defending the unity of God, he says the Son is not other (\"alius a patre filius non est\", ''Adv. Prax.'' 18) as a result of receiving a portion of the Father's substance.<ref name=\"stanford\"/> At times, speaking of the Father and the Son, Tertullian refers to \"two gods\".<ref name=\"stanford\"/>{{efn|\"Ergo, inquis, si deus dixit et deus fecit, si alius deus dixit et alius fecit, duo dii praedicantur. Si tam durus es, puta interim. Et ut adhuc amplius hoc putes, accipe et in psalmo duos deos dictos: Thronus tuus, deus, in aevum, <virga directionis> virga regni tui; dilexisti iustitiam et odisti iniquitatem, propterea unxit te deus, deus tuus.\" (\"Therefore\", thou sayest, \"if a god said and a god made, if one god said and another made, two gods are being preached.\" If thou art so hard, think a little! And that thou mayest think more fully, accept that in the Psalm two gods are spoken of: \"Thy throne, God, is for ever, a sceptre of right direction is thy sceptre; thou hast loved justice and hast hated iniquity, therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee.\" ''Adv. Prax. 13)}} He says that all things of the Father belong also to the Son, including his names, such as Almighty God, Most High, Lord of Hosts, or King of Israel.<ref>''Adv. Prax.'' 17.</ref> Though Tertullian considered the Father to be God (Yahweh), he responded to criticism of the [[Sabellianism|Modalist]] Praxeas that this meant that Tertullian's Christianity was not monotheistic by noting that even though there was one God (Yahweh, who became the Father when the Son became his agent of creation), the Son could also be referred to as God, when referred to apart from the Father, because the Son, though subordinate to God, is entitled to be called God \"from the unity of the Father\" in regards to being formed from a portion of His substance.<ref name=\"stanford\"/>{{efn|\"Si filium nolunt secundum a patre reputari ne secundus duos faciat deos dici, ostendimus etiam duos deos in scriptura relatos et duos dominos: et tamen ne de isto scandalizentur, rationem reddimus qua dei non duo dicantur nec domini sed qua pater et filius duo, et hoc non ex separatione substantiae sed ex dispositione, cum individuum et inseparatum filium a patre pronuntiamus, nec statu sed gradu alium, qui etsi deus dicatur quando nominatur singularis, non ideo duos deos faciat sed unum, hoc ipso quod et deus ex unitate patris vocari habeat.\" (If they do not wish that the Son be considered second to the Father, lest being second he cause it to be said that there are two gods, we have also showed that two gods are related in Scripture, and two lords. And yet, let them not be scandalized by this \u2013 we give a reason why there are not said to be two gods nor lords but rather two as a Father and a Son. And this not from separation of substance but from disposition, since we pronounce the Son undivided and unseparated from the Father, other not in status but in grade, who although he is said to be God when mentioned by himself, does not therefore make two gods but one, by the fact that he is also entitled to be called God from the unity of the Father. ''Adv. Prax.'' 19)}} ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' comments that for Tertullian, \"There was a time when there was no Son and no sin, when God was neither Father nor Judge.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14520c.htm|title=\"Tertullian,\" ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Princeton Theological Review 1906, pp. 56, 159\">[[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B. B. Warfield]] in ''Princeton Theological Review'', 1906, pp. 56, 159.</ref> Similarly [[J.N.D. Kelly]] has stated: \"Tertullian followed the Apologists in dating His 'perfect generation' from His extrapolation for the work of creation; prior to that moment God could not strictly be said to have had a Son, while after it the term 'Father', which for earlier theologians generally connoted God as author of reality, began to acquire the specialized meaning of Father and Son.\".<ref>J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines,'' Continual International Publishing Book, c1960, 2000, p. 112</ref>{{Verify quote|type=illogical quote|date=February 2016}} As regards the subjects of [[subordinationism|subordination]] of the Son to the Father, the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' has commented: \"In not a few areas of theology, Tertullian\u2019s views are, of course, completely unacceptable. Thus, for example, his teaching on the Trinity reveals a subordination of Son to Father that in the later crass form of [[Arianism]] the Church rejected as heretical.\"<ref name=\"lesaint\"/> Though he did not fully state the doctrine of the immanence of the Trinity, according to B. B. Warfield, he went a long distance in the way of approach to it.<ref name=\"Princeton Theological Review 1906, pp. 56, 159\"/>\n# In [[soteriology]], Tertullian does not dogmatize; he prefers to keep silence at the mystery of the cross (''De Patientia'', iii). The sufferings of Christ's life as well as of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] are efficacious to redemption. In the water of [[baptism]], which (upon a partial quotation of John 3:5) is made necessary (''De baptismo'', vi.), humans are born again; the baptized does not receive the [[Holy Spirit]] in the water, but is prepared for the Holy Spirit. Humans are little fishes\u2014after the example of the ''[[ichthys]]'', fish, Jesus Christ\u2014are born in water (''De baptismo'', i). In discussing whether sins committed subsequent to baptism may be forgiven, Tertullian calls baptism and [[penance]] \"two planks\" on which the sinner may be saved from shipwreck\u2014language which he gave to the Church (''De penitentia'', xii).\n# With reference to the '[[rule of faith]]', it may be said that Tertullian is constantly using this expression, and by it means ''now'' the authoritative tradition handed down in the Church, ''now'' the Scriptures themselves, and, ''perhaps'', a definite doctrinal formula. While he nowhere gives a list of the books of Scripture, he divides them into two parts and calls them the ''instrumentum '' and ''testamentum'' (''Adv. Marcionem'', iv.1). He distinguishes between the [[four Gospels]] and insists upon their apostolic origin as accrediting their authority (''De praescriptione'', xxxvi; ''Adv. Marcionem'', iv.1\u20135); in trying to account for Marcion's treatment of the Lucan Gospel and the Pauline writings he sarcastically queries whether the \"shipmaster from Pontus\" (Marcion) had ever been guilty of taking on contraband goods or tampering with them after they were aboard (''Adv. Marcionem'', v.1). The Scripture, the rule of faith, is for him fixed and authoritative (''De corona'', iii-iv). As opposed to the pagan writings they are divine (''De testimonio animae'', vi). They contain all truth (''De praescriptione'', vii, xiv) and from them the Church drinks (''potat'') her faith (''Adv. Praxeam'', xiii). The prophets were older than the Greek philosophers and their authority is accredited by the fulfilment of their predictions (''Apol.'', xix-xx). The Scriptures and the teachings of philosophy are incompatible, insofar as the latter are the origins of sub-Christian heresies. \"What has [[Athens]] to do with [[Jerusalem]]?\" he exclaims, \"or the Academy with the Church?\" (''De praescriptione'', vii). Philosophy as pop-paganism is a work of demons (''De anima'', i); the Scriptures contain the wisdom of heaven. However, Tertullian was not averse to using the technical methods of [[Stoicism]] to discuss a problem (''De anima''). The rule of faith, however, seems to be also applied by Tertullian to some distinct formula of doctrine, and he gives a succinct statement of the Christian faith under this term (''De praescriptione'', xiii).\n# Tertullian was a defender of the necessity of apostolicity. In his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', he explicitly challenges heretics to produce evidence of the [[apostolic succession]] of their communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm|title=The Prescription against Heretics: Chapter 32|publisher=}}</ref> \"Let them produce the original records of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [that first bishop of theirs] bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or of apostolic men\u2014a man, moreover, who continued steadfast with the apostles. For this is the manner in which the apostolic churches transmit their registers: as the [[Metropolis of Smyrna|church of Smyrna]], which records that [[Polycarp]] was placed therein by [[John the Apostle|John]]; as also the church of Rome, which makes [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] to have been ordained in like manner by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. In exactly the same way the other churches likewise exhibit (their several worthies), whom, as having been appointed to their episcopal places by apostles, they regard as transmitters of the apostolic seed.\"\n# [[Fornication|Fornicators]] and [[murder]]ers should never be readmitted into the church under any circumstances. In ''De pudicitia'', Tertullian condemns Pope [[Callixtus I]] for allowing such people to be readmitted if they show repentance.\n\n===Eschatology===\n;Resurrection at the Second Coming\nTertullian was a [[Premillennialism|premillennialist]], affirming a literal resurrection at the second advent of Jesus at the end of the world, not at death.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=255\u2013256}}\n;Jesus, the stone that strikes and destroys the image\nConcerning the image prophecy of [[Daniel 2]], Tertullian identified Jesus, at his second advent, as the stone cut out of a mountain that strikes and destroys the image of \"secular kingdoms\". He compares this with [[Daniel 7]], 'Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; and they brought Him before Him, and there was given Him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.\"<ref>Tertulian, Against Marcion, chap. 7, in ANF, Vol. 3, p. 326</ref>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=256}}\n;Antichrist is the Beast \nLike [[Irenaeus]], Tertullian equated the [[Antichrist]] with the '\"Man of Sin\" and the \"Beast\". He expected a specific Antichrist to appear as a persecutor of the church just before the resurrection, under whom a second company of martyrs will be slain. Unlike Irenaeus, however, Tertullian does not consider the Antichrist to be a Jew sitting in a Jewish temple at Jerusalem. Rather, the Antichrist comes out of the church.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=257}}\n;Rome symbolized as Babylon\nTertullian applied the biblical figure of [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]] to the city of Rome and her domination. He portrayed Rome as drunk with the blood of martyred saints.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=258}}\n;Order of Last Days events\nThe order of Last Days events, according to Tertullian, are the plagues, Babylon's doom, Antichrist's warfare on the saints, the devil cast into the bottomless pit, the Advent, the resurrection of the saints, the Judgment, and the Second Resurrection, with the harvest at the end of the World; and the sixth seal extending to the final dissolution of the earth and sky, including the stars.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=258\u2013259}}\n;Millennium follows resurrection of the righteous dead\nTertullian maintained that the thousand years of Revelation will follow the resurrection of the righteous dead on the earth with the [[New Jerusalem]], proceeding the eternity of heaven. The earth is destroyed after the one thousand years and the saints moved to the kingdom of heaven.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=259\u2013260}}\n;Seventy weeks fulfilled by First Advent\nTertullian contended that Daniel's [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|seventy weeks]] foretold the time of Christ's incarnation and death. He started the seventy weeks from the first year of [[Darius the Mede|Darius]], and continued to Jerusalem's destruction by the Romans under the command of Titus, fully completing the vision and prophecy.  It is sealed by the advent of Christ, which he places at the end of the sixty-two and one-half weeks.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=260\u2013261}}\n\n== Moral principles ==\n{{OR section|date=July 2015}}\nTertullian was a determined advocate of strict discipline and an austere code of practise, and like many of the African fathers, one of the leading representatives of the rigorist element in the early Church. These views may have led him to adopt [[Montanism]] with its ascetic [[rigor]] and its belief in [[chiliasm]] and the continuance of the prophetic gifts. In his writings on public amusements, the veiling of virgins, the conduct of women, and the like, he gives expression to these views.\n\nOn the principle that we should not look at or listen to what we have no right to practise, and that polluted things, seen and touched, pollute (''De spectaculis'', viii, xvii), he declared a Christian should abstain from the theater and the amphitheater. There pagan religious rites were applied and the names of pagan divinities invoked; there the precepts of modesty, purity, and humanity were ignored or set aside, and there no place was offered to the onlookers for the cultivation of the Christian graces. Women should put aside their gold and precious stones as ornaments,<ref>''De cultu'', v-vi</ref> and virgins should conform to the law of St. Paul for women and keep themselves strictly veiled (''De virginibus velandis''). He praised the unmarried state as the highest (''De monogamia'', xvii; ''Ad uxorem'', i.3) and called upon Christians not to allow themselves to be excelled in the virtue of celibacy by [[Vestal Virgin]]s and Egyptian priests. He even labeled second marriage a species of adultery (''De exhortationis castitatis'', ix), but this directly contradicted the Epistles of the [[Apostle Paul]]. Tertullian's resolve to never marry again and that no one else should remarry eventually led to his break with Rome because the orthodox church refused to follow him in this resolve. He, instead, favored the Montanist sect where they also condemned second marriage.{{sfn|Bitel|2008|p=21}} One reason for Tertullian's disdain for marriage was his belief about the transformation that awaited a married couple. He believed that marital relations coarsened the body and the soul and would dull their spiritual senses and avert the Holy Spirit since husband and wife became one flesh once married.{{sfn|Bitel|2008|p=17}}\n\nTertullian is sometimes criticized for being [[misogynistic]], on the basis of the contents of his ''De Cultu Feminarum,'' section I.I, part 2 (trans. C.W. Marx):{{cn|date=January 2017}} \"Do you not know that you are [[Eve]]? The judgment of God upon this sex lives on in this age; therefore, necessarily the guilt should live on also. \nYou are the gateway of the devil; you are the one who unseals the curse of that tree, and you are the first one to turn your back on the divine law; you are the one who persuaded him whom the devil was not capable of corrupting; you easily destroyed the image of God, [[Adam]]. Because of what you deserve, that is, death, even the Son of God had to die.\"\n\nTertullian had a radical view on the cosmos. He believed that heaven and earth intersected at many points and that it was possible that sexual relations with supernatural beings can occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1715.asp |title=Scholar Discusses the 'Bride of Christ' in the Early Church |website=Fordham.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118102358/https://legacy.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1715.asp |archivedate=November 18, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Septimi Florensis Tertulliani Opera.tif|thumb|''Septimi Florensis Tertulliani Opera'' (1598)]]\n{{Wikisource author}}\nTertullian's writings are edited in volumes 1\u20132 of the ''[[Patrologia Latina]],'' and modern texts exist in the ''[[Corpus Christianorum Latinorum]].''

Nonetheless, since their actual authors remain uncertain, they continue to be published together in collections of Tertullian's works.\n* 1. ''Adversus Omnes Haereses'' (Against all Heresies) \u2013 poss. [[Victorinus of Pettau]]\n* 2 ''De execrandis gentium diis'' (On the Execrable Gods of the Heathens)\n* 3 ''Carmen adversus Marcionem'' (Poem against Marcion)\n* 4 ''Carmen de Iona Propheta'' (Poem about the Prophet Jonas) \u2013 poss. [[Cyprianus Gallus]]\n* 5 ''Carmen de Sodoma'' (Poem about Sodom) \u2013 poss. [[Cyprianus Gallus]]\n* 6 ''Carmen de Genesi'' (Poem about Genesis)\n* 7 ''Carmen de Judicio Domini'' (Poem about the Judgment of the Lord)\n\nThe popular ''Passio SS. Perpetuae et Felicitatis'' (Martyrdom of SS. Perpetua and Felicitas), much of it the personal diary of St. [[Perpetua]], was once assumed to have been edited by Tertullian. That view is no longer held, and it is usually published separately from Tertullian's works.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Christian pacifism]]\n* [[Septimia (gens)]]\n* [[Pseudo-Tertullian]]\n* [[Tertulia]]\n* [[Descriptions in antiquity of the execution cross]]\n* [[List of Christian women of the patristic age]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Timothy|title=Tertullian: A literary and historical study|publisher= Oxford|year= 1971|edition= Reprinted with appendix of revisions 1985|url=https://archive.org/details/tertullianhistor0000barn|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0198143628|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|authors= Bitel, Lisa M.
