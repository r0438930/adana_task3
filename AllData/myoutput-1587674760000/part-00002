The novels have won a number of awards, including the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] in 1995 for ''Northern Lights'' and the 2001 [[Costa Book Awards|Whitbread Book of the Year]] for ''The Amber Spyglass''. In 2003, the trilogy was ranked third on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll.<ref name=\"Big Read\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml \"BBC&nbsp;\u2013 The Big Read\"]. BBC.

''[[La Belle Sauvage]]'', the first book in a new trilogy titled ''[[The Book of Dust]]'', was published on 19 October 2017; the second book of the new trilogy, ''[[The Secret Commonwealth]]'', was published in October 2019. Both are set in the same universe as ''Northern Lights''.\n\n==Settings==\n{{Main|Locations in His Dark Materials}}\nThe trilogy takes place across a [[multiverse]], moving between many parallel worlds. In ''Northern Lights'', the story takes place in a world with some similarities to our own; dress-style resembles that of the UK's [[Edwardian era]], and technology has not evolved to include automobiles or fixed-wing aircraft, while [[zeppelin]]s feature as a notable mode of transport.\n\nThe dominant religion has parallels with [[Christianity]],<ref name=cs61>Squires (2003: 61): \"Religion in Lyra's world...has similarities to the Christianity of 'our own universe', but also crucial differences\u2026[it] is based not in the Catholic centre of Rome, but in Geneva, Switzerland, where the centre of religious power, narrates Pullman, moved in the Middle Ages under the aegis of John Calvin\".</ref> and is at certain points in the series (especially in the later books) explicitly named so; while [[Adam and Eve]] are referenced in the text (particularly in ''[[The Subtle Knife]]'', in which [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]] tells [[Mary Malone]] that [[Lyra Belacqua]] is a new [[Eve]] to whom she is to be [[Serpent (Bible)|the serpent]]), [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] is not.<ref>{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Miller |work=[[The New Yorker]] |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/26/051226fa_fact?currentPage=all |title=Far From Narnia |publisher=2011 Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital |date=26 December 2005 |accessdate=10 November 2011 }}</ref> The Church (called the \"Magisterium\", the same name as the [[Magisterium#|authority of the Catholic Church]]) exerts a strong control over society and has some of the appearance and organisation of the [[Catholic Church]], but one in which the centre of power had moved from Rome to Geneva, moved there by Pullman's fictional \"Pope John Calvin\" ([[Geneva]] was the home of the historical [[John Calvin]]).<ref>''Northern Lights'' p. 31: \"Ever since Pope John Calvin had moved the seat of the papacy to Geneva \u2026 the Church's power over every aspect of life had been absolute\"</ref>\n\nIn ''The Subtle Knife'', the story moves between the world of the first novel, our own world, and in another world, the city of [[Citt\u00e0gazze]]. In ''The Amber Spyglass'' the story crosses through an array of diverse worlds.\n\n==Titles==\n[[File:Paradise Lost 9.jpg|thumb|[[Satan]] struggles through hell in a [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] illustration of ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.]]\nThe title of the series comes from 17th-century poet [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', Book 2:\n<blockquote><poem>\nInto this wilde Abyss,\nThe Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,\nOf neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,\nBut all these in their pregnant causes mixt \nConfus'dly, and which thus must ever fight,\nUnless th' Almighty Maker them ordain\n'''''His dark materials''''' to create more Worlds,\nInto this wilde Abyss the warie fiend\nStood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while,\nPondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith\nHe had to cross.\n</poem>\n\u2014 ''Paradise Lost'', Book 2, lines 910\u2013920\n</blockquote>\n\nPullman earlier proposed to name the series ''The Golden Compasses'', also a reference to ''Paradise Lost'',<ref name=\"btts\">{{cite web |url= http://www.bridgetothestars.net/index.php?p=FAQ#4|title= Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=20 August 2007 |publisher= BridgeToTheStars.net}}</ref> where they denote God's [[pair of compasses|circle-drawing instrument]] used to establish and set the bounds of all [[creation myth|creation]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; font-size:90%; width:200px; padding:1em; margin-left:1em\"\n|- valign=top\n| [[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|90px]]\n| [[File:God-Architect.jpg|90px]]\n|-\n| colspan=2 | God as architect, wielding the golden compasses, by [[William Blake]] (left) and [[Jesus]] as [[Geometry|geometer]] in a 13th-century [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[illuminated manuscript]].\n|}\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nThen staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand\n'''He took the golden compasses, prepared'''\n'''In God's eternal store, to circumscribe'''\n'''This universe, and all created things''':\nOne foot he centered, and the other turned\nRound through the vast profundity obscure\n</poem>\n\u2014 ''Paradise Lost'', Book 7, lines 224\u2013229\n</blockquote>\nDespite the confusion with the other common meaning of ''compass'' ([[compass|the navigational instrument]]) ''The Golden Compass'' became the title of the American edition of ''Northern Lights'' (the book features an \"[[His Dark Materials#Terminology|alethiometer]]\", a rare truth-telling device that one might describe as a \"golden compass\").\n\n== Plot ==\n===''Northern Lights'' (or ''The Golden Compass)''===\n{{Main|Northern Lights (novel)}}\n\nIn [[Jordan College, Oxford]], 11-year-old [[Lyra Belacqua]] and her [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]] Pantalaimon witness the [[Master (college)|Master]] attempt to poison [[Lord Asriel]], Lyra's rebellious and adventuring uncle. She warns Asriel, then spies on his lecture about [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]], mysterious [[elementary particle]]s. Lyra's friend Roger is kidnapped by child abductors known as the \"Gobblers.\" Lyra is adopted by a charming socialite, [[Marisa Coulter|Mrs Coulter]]. The Master secretly entrusts her with an alethiometer, a truth-telling device. Lyra discovers that Mrs Coulter is the leader of the Gobblers, and that it is a project secretly funded by the Church. Lyra flees to the [[Gyptians]], [[canal]]-faring [[Nomadic|nomads]], whose children have also been abducted. They reveal to Lyra that Asriel and Mrs Coulter are actually her parents.\n\nThe Gyptians form an expedition to the Arctic with Lyra to rescue the children. Lyra recruits [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]], an [[Panserbj\u00f8rne|armoured bear]], and his human [[aeronaut]] friend, [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Lee Scoresby|Lee Scoresby]]. She also learns that Lord Asriel has been exiled, guarded by the bears on [[Svalbard]].\n\nNear Bolvangar, the Gobbler research station, Lyra finds an abandoned child who has been cut from his d\u00e6mon; the Gobblers are experimenting on children by severing the bond between human and d\u00e6mon, a procedure called \u201cintercision.\u201d\n\nLyra is captured and taken to Bolvangar, where she is reunited with Roger. Mrs Coulter tells Lyra that the intercision prevents the onset of troubling adult emotions. Lyra and the children are rescued by Scoresby, Iorek, the Gyptians, and [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Serafina Pekkala|Serafina Pekkala]]'s flying witch clan. Lyra falls out of Scoresby's balloon and is taken by the panserbj\u00f8rne to the castle of their usurping king, [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iofur Raknison|Iofur Raknison]]. She tricks Iofur into fighting Iorek, who arrives with the others to rescue Lyra. Iorek kills Iofur and takes his place as the rightful king.\n\nLyra, Iorek, and Roger travel to Svalbard, where Asriel has continued his Dust research in exile. He tells Lyra that the Church believes Dust is the basis of [[Original sin|sin]], and plans to visit the other universes and destroy its source. He severs Roger from his d\u00e6mon, killing him and releasing enough energy to create an opening to a parallel universe. Lyra determines to stop Asriel and discover the source of Dust for herself.\n\n===''The Subtle Knife''===\n{{Main|The Subtle Knife}}\n\nLyra journeys through Asriel's opening between worlds to [[Citt\u00e0gazze]], a city whose denizens have discovered a clean path between worlds at a far earlier point in time than others in the storyline. Citt\u00e0gazze's reckless use of the technology has released soul-eating [[Spectre (His Dark Materials)|Spectre]]s, to which children are immune, rendering much of the world closed to transit by adults. Here Lyra meets [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]], a twelve-year-old boy from our world. Will, who recently killed a man to protect his ailing mother, has stumbled into Citt\u00e0gazze in an effort to locate his long-lost father. Venturing into Will's (our) world, Lyra meets Dr. Mary Malone, a physicist who is researching what she calls Shadow Particles, which are the same as Dust in Lyra's world. Lyra encourages Dr. Malone to attempt to communicate with the particles, and when she does they tell her to travel into the Citt\u00e0gazze world.\n\nWill becomes the bearer of the eponymous Subtle Knife, a tool forged 300 years ago by Citt\u00e0gazze's scientists from the same materials used to make [[Bolvangar]]'s silver guillotine. One edge of the knife can divide  [[subatomic particles]] and form subtle divisions in space, creating portals between worlds; the other edge easily cuts through any form of matter. After meeting with witches from Lyra's world, they continue their journey.\n\nMeanwhile, in Lyra's world, Lee Scoresby seeks out Stanislaus Grumman. When Scoresby finds him, Grumman insists on being taken through the opening into the Citt\u00e0gazze world in Scoresby's balloon. Scoresby dies defending Grumman from the forces of the Church. Grumman turns out to be Will's long-lost father and succeeds in reuniting with his son before he is murdered by a witch who loved him but whom he rejected. After his father's death, Will discovers that Lyra has been kidnapped and he is approached by two angels requesting his aid.\n\n===''The Amber Spyglass''===\n{{Main|The Amber Spyglass}}\n\n''The Amber Spyglass'' tells of Lyra's kidnapping by her mother, [[Marisa Coulter|Mrs Coulter]], an agent of the Magisterium who has learned of the prophecy identifying Lyra as the next [[Adam and Eve|Eve]]. A pair of angels, Balthamos and Baruch, tell Will that he must travel with them to give the Subtle Knife to Lyra's father, [[Lord Asriel]], as a weapon against [[Authority (His Dark Materials)|The Authority]]. Will ignores the angels; with the help of a local girl named Ama, the [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iorek Byrnison|Bear King Iorek Byrnison]], and [[Lord Asriel]]'s [[Gallivespian]] spies, the [[Chevalier Tialys]] and the [[Lady Salmakia]], he rescues Lyra from the cave where her mother has hidden her from the Magisterium, which has become determined to kill her before she yields to temptation and sin like the original Eve.\n\nWill, Lyra, Tialys and Salmakia journey to the Land of the Dead, temporarily parting with their [[d\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mons]] to release the ghosts from their captivity. [[Mary Malone]], a scientist from Will's world interested in \"shadows\" (or [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]] in Lyra's world), travels to a land populated by strange sentient creatures called [[Mulefa]]. There she comes to understand the true nature of Dust, which is both created by and nourishes life which has become self-aware. [[Lord Asriel]] and the reformed [[Mrs Coulter]] work to destroy the Authority's [[Regent]] [[Metatron]]. They succeed, but themselves suffer annihilation in the process by pulling Metatron into the abyss.\n\nThe Authority himself dies of his own frailty when Will and Lyra free him from the crystal prison wherein Metatron had trapped him, able to do so because an attack by [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Cliff-ghasts and night-ghasts|cliff-ghasts]] kills or drives away the prison's protectors. When Will and Lyra emerge from the land of the dead, they find their d\u00e6mons.\n\nThe book ends with Will and Lyra falling in love but realising they cannot live together in the same world, because all windows \u2014 except one from the underworld to the world of the Mulefa \u2014 must be closed to prevent the loss of Dust, because with every window opening, a Spectre would be created and that means Will must never use the knife again. They must also be apart because both of them can only live full lives in their native worlds. During the return, Mary Malone learns how to see her own d\u00e6mon, who takes the form of a black [[Alpine chough]]. Lyra loses her ability to intuitively read the alethiometer and determines to learn how to use her conscious mind to achieve the same effect.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Please remember that character information duplicates 1. on main HDM page  2.

Entries in this list should be VERY BRIEF, with fuller exposition elsewhere. -->\n{{main|List of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust characters}}\n\nAll humans in Lyra's world, including witches, have a [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]. It is the physical manifestation of a person's 'inner being', soul or spirit. It takes the form of a creature (moth, bird, dog, monkey, snake, etc.) and is usually the opposite sex to its human counterpart. The d\u00e6mons of children have the ability to change form - from one creature to another - but towards the end of a child's puberty, their d\u00e6mon \"settles\" into a permanent form, which reflects the person's personality. When a person dies, the d\u00e6mon dies too. Armoured bears, cliff ghasts and other creatures do not have d\u00e6mons. An armoured bear's armour is his soul.\n\n*[[Lyra Belacqua]], a wild 12-year-old girl, has grown up in the fictional [[Jordan College, Oxford]]. She is skinny with dark blonde hair and blue eyes. She prides herself on her capacity for mischief, especially her ability to lie, earning her the [[epithet]] \"Silvertongue\" from Iorek Byrnison. Lyra has a natural ability to use the alethiometer, which is capable of answering any question when properly manipulated and read.\n*[[Lyra Belacqua#Pantalaimon|Pantalaimon]] is Lyra's [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]. Like all d\u00e6mons of children, he changes from one creature to another constantly. When Lyra reaches puberty, he assumes the permanent form of a [[European pine marten|pine marten]]. Pantalaimon and Lyra follow her father, Lord Asriel, when he travels to the newly discovered world of Cittagazze, where Lyra meets Will.\n*[[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]], a sensible, morally conscious, assertive 12-year-old boy from our world. He becomes the bearer of the subtle knife. Will is independent and responsible for his age, having looked after his mentally ill mother for several years.\n*[[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)#D\u00e6mon|Kirjava]] is Will's d\u00e6mon (named by Serafina Pekkala). She does not settle before the end of the story; but it is hinted that she will take the form of a cat.\n*The [[Authority (His Dark Materials)|Authority]] is the first angel to have emerged from Dust. He controls the Church, an oppressive religious institution. He told the later-arriving angels that he created them and the universe, but this is a lie. Although he is one of the two primary adversaries in the trilogy \u2014 Lord Asriel is his primary opponent \u2014 he remains in the background; he makes his only appearance late in ''The Amber Spyglass.'' The Authority has grown weak and transferred most of his powers to his regent, [[Metatron]]. He is extremely aged, fragile and naive.\n*[[Lord Asriel]], ostensibly Lyra's uncle, is later revealed to be her father. He opens a rift between the worlds in his pursuit of Dust. His dream of establishing a Republic of Heaven to rival the Authority's Kingdom leads him to use his power to raise a grand army from across the multiverse to rise up in rebellion against the forces of the Church.\n*[[Marisa Coulter]] is the coldly beautiful, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] mother of Lyra and former lover of Lord Asriel. She serves the Church by kidnapping children for research into the nature of Dust, in the course of which she separates them from their d\u00e6mons - a procedure known as intercision. She has black hair, a slim build, and looks younger than she is. Initially hostile to Lyra, she realises that she loves her daughter and seeks to protect her from agents of the Church, who want to kill Lyra. Her d\u00e6mon is a golden monkey with a cruel streak.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Metatron|Metatron]], Asriel's principal adversary, was a human, [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], in biblical times, but was later transfigured into an [[angel]]. The Authority has displayed his declining health by appointing Metatron his Regent. As Regent, Metatron has implanted the monotheistic religions across the universes. He becomes vulnerable to the seductive advances of Marisa Coulter, who betrays him by luring him into the underworld to his death. He is the series' main antagonist.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lord Boreal|Lord Carlo Boreal]], or Sir Charles Latrom, CBE as he is known as in [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]]'s world, serves as a minor character in ''Northern Lights'', but is a main antagonist in ''[[The Subtle Knife]]''. He is an old Englishman, appearing to be in his sixties. He normally wears pale suits and is described as smelling sweetly. He is ultimately poisoned by Mrs Coulter, to whom he has previously been a lover.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Dr. Mary Malone|Mary Malone]], is a [[physicist]] and former [[nun]] from Will's world. She meets Lyra during Lyra's first visit to Will's world. Lyra provides Mary with insight into the nature of [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]]. Agents of the Church force Mary to flee to the world of the [[mulefa]]. There she constructs the amber spyglass, which enables her to see the otherwise invisible Dust. Her purpose is to learn why Dust, which mulefa civilization depends on, is flowing out of the universe. Mary relates a story of a lost love to Will and Lyra, and later packs for them a lunch containing \"little red fruits\", which her computer, \"the Cave,\" had instructed her to do.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]] is a massive armoured bear. An armoured bear's armour is his soul. Iorek's armour is stolen, so he becomes despondent. With Lyra's help he regains his armour, his dignity, and his kingship over the armoured bears. In gratitude, and impressed by her cunning, he dubs her \"Lyra Silvertongue\". A powerful warrior and [[armour]]smith, Iorek repairs the Subtle Knife when it shatters. He later goes to war against The Authority and Metatron.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lee Scoresby|Lee Scoresby]], a rangy [[Texas|Texan]], is a balloonist. He helps Lyra in an early quest to reach Asriel's residence in the North, and he later helps John Parry reunite with his son Will.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Serafina Pekkala|Serafina Pekkala]] is the beautiful queen of a clan of Northern [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Witches|witches]]. Her [[snow goose|snow-goose]] [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]] Kaisa, like all witches' d\u00e6mons, can travel much farther apart from her than the d\u00e6mons of humans, without feeling the pain of separation.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#The Master of Jordan College|The Master of Jordan]] heads Jordan College, part of Oxford University in Lyra's world. Helped by other Jordan College employees, he is raising the supposedly orphaned Lyra. Faced with difficult choices that only later become apparent, he tries unsuccessfully to poison Lord Asriel.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Roger Parslow|Roger Parslow]] is the kitchen boy at Jordan College and Lyra's best friend.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Parry|John Parry]] is Will's father. He is an explorer from our world who discovered a portal to Lyra's world and became the shaman known as Stanislaus Grumman or Jopari, a corruption of his original name.\n*The [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gallivespians|Four Gallivespians]]: Lord Roke, Madame Oxentiel, Chevalier Tialys and Lady Salmakia \u2014 are tiny people (a hand-span tall) with poisonous heel spurs.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Ma Costa|Ma Costa]]: A Gyptian woman whose son, Billy Costa is abducted by the \"Gobblers\". She rescues Lyra from Mrs Coulter and takes her to John Faa. We later discover that Ma Costa nursed Lyra, when she was a baby.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Faa|John Faa]]: The King of all the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gyptians|Gyptians]]. He journeys with Lyra to the North with his companion [[Farder Coram]]. Faa and Costa rescue Lyra when she runs away from Mrs Coulter. Then they take her to Iorek Byrnison.\n*Father Gomez is a priest sent by the Church to assassinate Lyra. The angel [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Balthamos|Balthamos]] kills Gomez before he can reach her.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Fra Pavel|Fra Pavel Ra\u0161ek]] is a representative and alethiometrist of the Consistorial Court of Discipline. He is said to be a sluggish reader of the device, his [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]] is a [[frog]].\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Balthamos|Balthamos]] is a rebel angel who, with his lover Baruch, join in Will's journey to find the captured Lyra. Near the end of the story, he saves both Lyra's and Will's lives by killing Father Gomez. Upon ensuring their safety, Balthamos calls out Baruch's name and dies.\n*Tony Makarios is a naive boy who is lured into captivity by Mrs Coulter.\n*[[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are four-legged wheeled animals; they have one leg in front, one in back, and one on each side. The \"wheels\" are huge, round, hard seed-pods from seed-pod trees; an axle-like claw at the end of each leg grips a seed-pod. The Mulefa society is primitive.\n\n== D\u00e6mons ==\n[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' (1489\u201390), along with two portraits by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], helped inspire Pullman's \"d\u00e6mon\" concept.<ref name=\"butler\">{{Cite news|author=Robert Butler |title=An Interview with Philip Pullman |series=Intelligent Life |work=The Economist |date=3 December 2007 |url=http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/697 |accessdate=10 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305011900/http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/697 |archivedate=5 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n{{Main|D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)}}\nOne distinctive aspect of Pullman's story is the presence of \"[[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]s\" (pronounced \"demon\").

Lyra flees to the [[Gyptians]], [[canal]]-faring [[Nomadic|nomads]], whose children have also been abducted. They reveal to Lyra that Asriel and Mrs Coulter are actually her parents.\n\nThe Gyptians form an expedition to the Arctic with Lyra to rescue the children. Lyra recruits [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]], an [[Panserbj\u00f8rne|armoured bear]], and his human [[aeronaut]] friend, [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Lee Scoresby|Lee Scoresby]]. She also learns that Lord Asriel has been exiled, guarded by the bears on [[Svalbard]].\n\nNear Bolvangar, the Gobbler research station, Lyra finds an abandoned child who has been cut from his d\u00e6mon; the Gobblers are experimenting on children by severing the bond between human and d\u00e6mon, a procedure called \u201cintercision.\u201d\n\nLyra is captured and taken to Bolvangar, where she is reunited with Roger. Mrs Coulter tells Lyra that the intercision prevents the onset of troubling adult emotions. Lyra and the children are rescued by Scoresby, Iorek, the Gyptians, and [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Serafina Pekkala|Serafina Pekkala]]'s flying witch clan. Lyra falls out of Scoresby's balloon and is taken by the panserbj\u00f8rne to the castle of their usurping king, [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iofur Raknison|Iofur Raknison]]. She tricks Iofur into fighting Iorek, who arrives with the others to rescue Lyra. Iorek kills Iofur and takes his place as the rightful king.\n\nLyra, Iorek, and Roger travel to Svalbard, where Asriel has continued his Dust research in exile. He tells Lyra that the Church believes Dust is the basis of [[Original sin|sin]], and plans to visit the other universes and destroy its source. He severs Roger from his d\u00e6mon, killing him and releasing enough energy to create an opening to a parallel universe. Lyra determines to stop Asriel and discover the source of Dust for herself.\n\n===''The Subtle Knife''===\n{{Main|The Subtle Knife}}\n\nLyra journeys through Asriel's opening between worlds to [[Citt\u00e0gazze]], a city whose denizens have discovered a clean path between worlds at a far earlier point in time than others in the storyline. Citt\u00e0gazze's reckless use of the technology has released soul-eating [[Spectre (His Dark Materials)|Spectre]]s, to which children are immune, rendering much of the world closed to transit by adults. Here Lyra meets [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]], a twelve-year-old boy from our world. Will, who recently killed a man to protect his ailing mother, has stumbled into Citt\u00e0gazze in an effort to locate his long-lost father. Venturing into Will's (our) world, Lyra meets Dr. Mary Malone, a physicist who is researching what she calls Shadow Particles, which are the same as Dust in Lyra's world. Lyra encourages Dr. Malone to attempt to communicate with the particles, and when she does they tell her to travel into the Citt\u00e0gazze world.\n\nWill becomes the bearer of the eponymous Subtle Knife, a tool forged 300 years ago by Citt\u00e0gazze's scientists from the same materials used to make [[Bolvangar]]'s silver guillotine. One edge of the knife can divide  [[subatomic particles]] and form subtle divisions in space, creating portals between worlds; the other edge easily cuts through any form of matter. After meeting with witches from Lyra's world, they continue their journey.\n\nMeanwhile, in Lyra's world, Lee Scoresby seeks out Stanislaus Grumman. When Scoresby finds him, Grumman insists on being taken through the opening into the Citt\u00e0gazze world in Scoresby's balloon. Scoresby dies defending Grumman from the forces of the Church. Grumman turns out to be Will's long-lost father and succeeds in reuniting with his son before he is murdered by a witch who loved him but whom he rejected. After his father's death, Will discovers that Lyra has been kidnapped and he is approached by two angels requesting his aid.\n\n===''The Amber Spyglass''===\n{{Main|The Amber Spyglass}}\n\n''The Amber Spyglass'' tells of Lyra's kidnapping by her mother, [[Marisa Coulter|Mrs Coulter]], an agent of the Magisterium who has learned of the prophecy identifying Lyra as the next [[Adam and Eve|Eve]]. A pair of angels, Balthamos and Baruch, tell Will that he must travel with them to give the Subtle Knife to Lyra's father, [[Lord Asriel]], as a weapon against [[Authority (His Dark Materials)|The Authority]]. Will ignores the angels; with the help of a local girl named Ama, the [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iorek Byrnison|Bear King Iorek Byrnison]], and [[Lord Asriel]]'s [[Gallivespian]] spies, the [[Chevalier Tialys]] and the [[Lady Salmakia]], he rescues Lyra from the cave where her mother has hidden her from the Magisterium, which has become determined to kill her before she yields to temptation and sin like the original Eve.\n\nWill, Lyra, Tialys and Salmakia journey to the Land of the Dead, temporarily parting with their [[d\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mons]] to release the ghosts from their captivity. [[Mary Malone]], a scientist from Will's world interested in \"shadows\" (or [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]] in Lyra's world), travels to a land populated by strange sentient creatures called [[Mulefa]]. There she comes to understand the true nature of Dust, which is both created by and nourishes life which has become self-aware. [[Lord Asriel]] and the reformed [[Mrs Coulter]] work to destroy the Authority's [[Regent]] [[Metatron]]. They succeed, but themselves suffer annihilation in the process by pulling Metatron into the abyss.\n\nThe Authority himself dies of his own frailty when Will and Lyra free him from the crystal prison wherein Metatron had trapped him, able to do so because an attack by [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Cliff-ghasts and night-ghasts|cliff-ghasts]] kills or drives away the prison's protectors. When Will and Lyra emerge from the land of the dead, they find their d\u00e6mons.\n\nThe book ends with Will and Lyra falling in love but realising they cannot live together in the same world, because all windows \u2014 except one from the underworld to the world of the Mulefa \u2014 must be closed to prevent the loss of Dust, because with every window opening, a Spectre would be created and that means Will must never use the knife again. They must also be apart because both of them can only live full lives in their native worlds. During the return, Mary Malone learns how to see her own d\u00e6mon, who takes the form of a black [[Alpine chough]]. Lyra loses her ability to intuitively read the alethiometer and determines to learn how to use her conscious mind to achieve the same effect.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Please remember that character information duplicates 1. on main HDM page  2. On character list page 3. On individual character pages and 4. Northern Lights page. Entries in this list should be VERY BRIEF, with fuller exposition elsewhere. -->\n{{main|List of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust characters}}\n\nAll humans in Lyra's world, including witches, have a [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]. It is the physical manifestation of a person's 'inner being', soul or spirit. It takes the form of a creature (moth, bird, dog, monkey, snake, etc.) and is usually the opposite sex to its human counterpart. The d\u00e6mons of children have the ability to change form - from one creature to another - but towards the end of a child's puberty, their d\u00e6mon \"settles\" into a permanent form, which reflects the person's personality. When a person dies, the d\u00e6mon dies too. Armoured bears, cliff ghasts and other creatures do not have d\u00e6mons. An armoured bear's armour is his soul.\n\n*[[Lyra Belacqua]], a wild 12-year-old girl, has grown up in the fictional [[Jordan College, Oxford]]. She is skinny with dark blonde hair and blue eyes. She prides herself on her capacity for mischief, especially her ability to lie, earning her the [[epithet]] \"Silvertongue\" from Iorek Byrnison. Lyra has a natural ability to use the alethiometer, which is capable of answering any question when properly manipulated and read.\n*[[Lyra Belacqua#Pantalaimon|Pantalaimon]] is Lyra's [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]. Like all d\u00e6mons of children, he changes from one creature to another constantly. When Lyra reaches puberty, he assumes the permanent form of a [[European pine marten|pine marten]]. Pantalaimon and Lyra follow her father, Lord Asriel, when he travels to the newly discovered world of Cittagazze, where Lyra meets Will.\n*[[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]], a sensible, morally conscious, assertive 12-year-old boy from our world. He becomes the bearer of the subtle knife. Will is independent and responsible for his age, having looked after his mentally ill mother for several years.\n*[[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)#D\u00e6mon|Kirjava]] is Will's d\u00e6mon (named by Serafina Pekkala). She does not settle before the end of the story; but it is hinted that she will take the form of a cat.\n*The [[Authority (His Dark Materials)|Authority]] is the first angel to have emerged from Dust. He controls the Church, an oppressive religious institution. He told the later-arriving angels that he created them and the universe, but this is a lie. Although he is one of the two primary adversaries in the trilogy \u2014 Lord Asriel is his primary opponent \u2014 he remains in the background; he makes his only appearance late in ''The Amber Spyglass.'' The Authority has grown weak and transferred most of his powers to his regent, [[Metatron]]. He is extremely aged, fragile and naive.\n*[[Lord Asriel]], ostensibly Lyra's uncle, is later revealed to be her father. He opens a rift between the worlds in his pursuit of Dust. His dream of establishing a Republic of Heaven to rival the Authority's Kingdom leads him to use his power to raise a grand army from across the multiverse to rise up in rebellion against the forces of the Church.\n*[[Marisa Coulter]] is the coldly beautiful, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] mother of Lyra and former lover of Lord Asriel. She serves the Church by kidnapping children for research into the nature of Dust, in the course of which she separates them from their d\u00e6mons - a procedure known as intercision. She has black hair, a slim build, and looks younger than she is. Initially hostile to Lyra, she realises that she loves her daughter and seeks to protect her from agents of the Church, who want to kill Lyra. Her d\u00e6mon is a golden monkey with a cruel streak.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Metatron|Metatron]], Asriel's principal adversary, was a human, [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], in biblical times, but was later transfigured into an [[angel]]. The Authority has displayed his declining health by appointing Metatron his Regent. As Regent, Metatron has implanted the monotheistic religions across the universes. He becomes vulnerable to the seductive advances of Marisa Coulter, who betrays him by luring him into the underworld to his death. He is the series' main antagonist.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lord Boreal|Lord Carlo Boreal]], or Sir Charles Latrom, CBE as he is known as in [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]]'s world, serves as a minor character in ''Northern Lights'', but is a main antagonist in ''[[The Subtle Knife]]''. He is an old Englishman, appearing to be in his sixties. He normally wears pale suits and is described as smelling sweetly. He is ultimately poisoned by Mrs Coulter, to whom he has previously been a lover.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Dr. Mary Malone|Mary Malone]], is a [[physicist]] and former [[nun]] from Will's world. She meets Lyra during Lyra's first visit to Will's world. Lyra provides Mary with insight into the nature of [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]]. Agents of the Church force Mary to flee to the world of the [[mulefa]]. There she constructs the amber spyglass, which enables her to see the otherwise invisible Dust. Her purpose is to learn why Dust, which mulefa civilization depends on, is flowing out of the universe. Mary relates a story of a lost love to Will and Lyra, and later packs for them a lunch containing \"little red fruits\", which her computer, \"the Cave,\" had instructed her to do.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]] is a massive armoured bear. An armoured bear's armour is his soul. Iorek's armour is stolen, so he becomes despondent. With Lyra's help he regains his armour, his dignity, and his kingship over the armoured bears. In gratitude, and impressed by her cunning, he dubs her \"Lyra Silvertongue\". A powerful warrior and [[armour]]smith, Iorek repairs the Subtle Knife when it shatters. He later goes to war against The Authority and Metatron.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lee Scoresby|Lee Scoresby]], a rangy [[Texas|Texan]], is a balloonist. He helps Lyra in an early quest to reach Asriel's residence in the North, and he later helps John Parry reunite with his son Will.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Serafina Pekkala|Serafina Pekkala]] is the beautiful queen of a clan of Northern [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Witches|witches]]. Her [[snow goose|snow-goose]] [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]] Kaisa, like all witches' d\u00e6mons, can travel much farther apart from her than the d\u00e6mons of humans, without feeling the pain of separation.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#The Master of Jordan College|The Master of Jordan]] heads Jordan College, part of Oxford University in Lyra's world. Helped by other Jordan College employees, he is raising the supposedly orphaned Lyra. Faced with difficult choices that only later become apparent, he tries unsuccessfully to poison Lord Asriel.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Roger Parslow|Roger Parslow]] is the kitchen boy at Jordan College and Lyra's best friend.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Parry|John Parry]] is Will's father. He is an explorer from our world who discovered a portal to Lyra's world and became the shaman known as Stanislaus Grumman or Jopari, a corruption of his original name.\n*The [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gallivespians|Four Gallivespians]]: Lord Roke, Madame Oxentiel, Chevalier Tialys and Lady Salmakia \u2014 are tiny people (a hand-span tall) with poisonous heel spurs.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Ma Costa|Ma Costa]]: A Gyptian woman whose son, Billy Costa is abducted by the \"Gobblers\". She rescues Lyra from Mrs Coulter and takes her to John Faa. We later discover that Ma Costa nursed Lyra, when she was a baby.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Faa|John Faa]]: The King of all the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gyptians|Gyptians]]. He journeys with Lyra to the North with his companion [[Farder Coram]]. Faa and Costa rescue Lyra when she runs away from Mrs Coulter. Then they take her to Iorek Byrnison.\n*Father Gomez is a priest sent by the Church to assassinate Lyra. The angel [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Balthamos|Balthamos]] kills Gomez before he can reach her.\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Fra Pavel|Fra Pavel Ra\u0161ek]] is a representative and alethiometrist of the Consistorial Court of Discipline. He is said to be a sluggish reader of the device, his [[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]] is a [[frog]].\n*[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Balthamos|Balthamos]] is a rebel angel who, with his lover Baruch, join in Will's journey to find the captured Lyra. Near the end of the story, he saves both Lyra's and Will's lives by killing Father Gomez. Upon ensuring their safety, Balthamos calls out Baruch's name and dies.\n*Tony Makarios is a naive boy who is lured into captivity by Mrs Coulter.\n*[[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are four-legged wheeled animals; they have one leg in front, one in back, and one on each side. The \"wheels\" are huge, round, hard seed-pods from seed-pod trees; an axle-like claw at the end of each leg grips a seed-pod. The Mulefa society is primitive.\n\n== D\u00e6mons ==\n[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' (1489\u201390), along with two portraits by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], helped inspire Pullman's \"d\u00e6mon\" concept.<ref name=\"butler\">{{Cite news|author=Robert Butler |title=An Interview with Philip Pullman |series=Intelligent Life |work=The Economist |date=3 December 2007 |url=http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/697 |accessdate=10 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305011900/http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/697 |archivedate=5 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n{{Main|D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)}}\nOne distinctive aspect of Pullman's story is the presence of \"[[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]]s\" (pronounced \"demon\").
