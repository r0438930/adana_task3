The Bowie knife is not well defined. By the mid-20th century most would include some combination of blade length and blade shape. In the mid-19th century, when the popularity of the knife was at its peak, the term was applied to a wide range of blades.<ref>{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Howard L. | title = American Knives; The First History and Collector's Guide | publisher = Gun Room Press | location = Highland Park, N. J. | year = 1958 | page = 26}} Four definitions of \"Bowie\" knives had supporters (in the mid-20th century). All agree that they are sheath knives (basically short swords with a handle and a blade optionally separated by a guard). Some require a blade length; some require a clipped blade; some require both; some require neither for knives produced between 1830 and 1890.</ref>  Absent a consensus definition, it is impossible to clearly define the origin of the knife. To complicate matters, some American blades that meet the modern definition of the Bowie knife may pre-date Bowie.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | page = 345}} \"Nor was the \"clip point\" unknown in America, pre-Jim Bowie.\"  (Accompanied by examples and references.)</ref>\n\nThe Bowie knife derives part of its name and reputation from [[James Bowie]], a notorious [[knife fight]]er, who died at the Alamo. James Bowie left a very thin paper trail; in the absence of verifiable facts, his history was buried in unverifiable knife-fighting legend. Historians seriously entertain the possibility that Bowie only fought one personal knife fight<ref>{{cite book | last = Davis | first = William C. | authorlink= William C.

That [[Sandbar Fight]] received national publicity (accounts in Philadelphia, New York, and the ''Niles' Register'' of Washington, D.C.) within months of the event. James Bowie prominently wore a large knife after the Sandbar fight.\n\nThe Bowie family provided a variety of conflicting knife histories. James Bowie left nothing. His brother [[Rezin Bowie]] provided a terse history two years after James' death. Sixteen years after James' death someone (assumed to be James' brother John) slightly amended Rezin's explanation to include a blacksmith. Rezin's grandchildren named a different blacksmith. A later Bowie claimed that the information attributed to John was a lie and that John probably never saw the document, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J.

(2002).''Knives and their Values'', p. 64</ref>  In an 1828 account of the capture of a pirate schooner carrying a mixed group of Spanish and South American pirates, the carrying of knives similar to the early Bowie knife is mentioned:\n\n{{quote|Amongst these [weapons], were a large number of long knives \u2013 weapons which the Spaniards use very dexterously.

Bowie and his brothers would later commission more ornate custom blades from various knife makers including Daniel Searles and John Constable.<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite journal |last = Cumpston|first= Mike|title = The American Excalibur: Jim Bowie's lethal legacy | journal = Guns Magazine| date = 2007-04-01|volume=57|issue=4}}</ref>   [[George William Featherstonhaugh]] described them as, \"These formidable instruments ... are the pride of an Arkansas blood, and got their name of Bowie knives from a conspicuous person of this fiery climate.\"<ref name=\"Featherstonhaugh\">{{Cite journal | last = Featherstonhaugh | first = George William | authorlink = George William Featherstonhaugh | title = Excursion Through The Slave States, From Washington On The Potomac To The Frontier Of Mexico | year = 1844 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to an 1847 article, the Bowie knife was originally designed to fill the need for a wearable, convenient, close-combat weapon -  a short sword much shorter than the [[saber]] or other swords of the day, yet still possessing a heavy blade. This cleaver-like blade had enough weight to give the blade sufficient force in a slashing attack, while permitting the use of cut-and-thrust sword fighting tactics.<ref name=\"ROB\"/>  By this time the 'Bowie knife' was already being made in a variety of sizes, with the optimum blade length similar to \"that of a carving knife\".<ref name=\"ROB\">[[Joseph Clinton Robertson|Robertson, J.

The back of the blade sometimes had a strip of soft metal (normally [[brass]] or [[copper]]) inlaid which some believe was intended to catch an opponent's blade while others hold it was intended to provide support and absorb shock to help prevent breaking of poor quality steel or poorly heat treated blades. (A brass back is an indication of modern construction.<ref>{{cite book| last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | pages = 464\u2013466}}  \"[N]o authenticated brass back Bowie has yet to be accepted in all quarters as genuine{{nbsp}}...\".</ref>)  Bowie knives often had an upper guard that bent forward at an angle (an [[S-guard]]) intended to catch an opponent's blade or provide protection to the owner's hand during parries and corps-a-corps.\n\nSome Bowie knives had a notch on the bottom of the blade near the [[hilt]] known as a \"Spanish Notch\". The Spanish Notch is often cited as a mechanism for catching an opponent's blade; however, some Bowie researchers hold that the Spanish Notch is ill-suited to this function and frequently fails to achieve the desired results. These researchers, instead, hold that the Spanish Notch has the much more mundane function as a tool for stripping [[sinew]] and repairing [[rope]] and nets, as a guide to assist in sharpening the blade (assuring that the sharpening process starts at a specific point and not further up the edge), or as a point to relieve stress on the blade during use.\n\nOne characteristic of Bowie knives is the [[clip point]] at the top of the blade, which brings the tip of the blade lower than the spine and in line with the handle for better control during thrusting attacks. As the goal is to produce a sharp, stabbing point, most Bowie knives have a bevel ground along the clip, typically 1/4 of the way, but sometimes much further running the entire top-edge. This is referred to as a false [[edge]] as from a distance it looks sharpened, although it may or may not be. Regardless of whether or not the false edge is sharp, it serves to take metal away from the point, streamlining the tip and thus enhancing the penetration capability of the blade during a stab. The version attributed to blacksmith James Black had this false edge fully sharpened in order to allow someone trained in European techniques of [[Sabre (fencing)|saber fencing]] to execute the maneuver called the \"back cut\" or \"back slash\"..<ref name=\"MC\"/>  A brass [[quillon]], usually cast in a mold, was attached to protect the hand.\n\nThe Bowie knife's design also lends itself to use as a hunting knife for skinning or butchering game. The curved top clip bevel of the blade, when suitably sharpened, may be used to remove the skin from a [[Cadaver|carcass]], while the straight portion of the blade edge, toward the guard, can be used for cutting meat. Arkansas culturalist and researcher Russell T. Johnson describes the [[James Black]] knife in the following manner and at the same time captures the quintessence of the Bowie Knife: \"It must be long enough to use as a sword, sharp enough to use as a razor, wide enough to use as a paddle, and heavy enough to use as a hatchet.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/><ref name=\"RJ\"/>  Most such knives intended for hunting are only sharpened on one edge, to reduce the danger of cutting oneself while butchering and [[skinning]] the carcass.\n\n== History ==\n=== The Vidalia Sandbar Fight ===\n[[File:Coffin handle bowie knife.jpg|thumb|right|A coffin-handled Bowie knife]]\n{{Main|Sandbar Fight}}\n\nThe first knife, with which Bowie became famous, allegedly was designed by Jim Bowie's brother Rezin in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana]] and smithed by blacksmith Jesse Clifft out of an old file.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Period court documents indicate that [[Rezin Bowie]] and Clifft were well acquainted with one another. Rezin's granddaughter claimed in an 1885 letter to [[Louisiana State University]] that she personally witnessed Clifft make the knife for her grandfather.\n\nThis knife became famous as the knife used by Bowie at the [[Sandbar Fight]], a famous 1827 [[duel]] between Bowie and several men including a Major Norris Wright of [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  The fight took place on a [[sandbar]] in the [[Mississippi River]] across from [[Natchez, Mississippi]], and is the only documented fight in which Bowie was known to have employed his Bowie knife design. In this battle Bowie was stabbed, shot, and beaten half to death but managed to win the fight using the large knife.<ref name =\"MC\"/>\n\nJim Bowie's older brother John would later claim that the knife at the Sandbar Fight was not Clifft's knife, but a knife specifically made for Bowie by a blacksmith named Snowden.<ref name=\"Shackleford2010\">{{cite book|last=Shackleford|first=Steve |title=Blade's Guide to Knives & Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6NZd17WtWoC&pg=PA307|accessdate=27 January 2012|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-0387-9|page=307}}</ref>\n\n=== James Black's Bowie knife ===\nThe most famous version of the Bowie knife was designed by Jim Bowie and presented to [[Arkansas]] [[blacksmith]] [[James Black (blacksmith)|James Black]] in the form of a carved wooden model in December 1830.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Black produced the knife ordered by Bowie, and at the same time created another based on Bowie's original design but with a sharpened edge on the curved top edge of the blade.

Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife's death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade.\n\nBlack's knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true [[Damascus steel]].<ref name=\"RJ\"/>\n\nIn 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, [[Daniel Webster Jones (governor)|Daniel Webster Jones]]. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.\n\nThe birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the [[Old Washington Historic State Park]] which has over 40 restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black's shop. The park is known as \"The [[Colonial Williamsburg]] of Arkansas\". The [[American Bladesmith Society]] established the [[William F.

From context, \"Bowie knife\" needed no description then, but the spelling was variable. Among the first mentions was a plan to combine a Bowie knife and pistol. Cutlers were shipping sheath knives from Sheffield England by the early 1830s. By 1838 a writer in a Baltimore newspaper (posted from New Orleans) suggested that every reader had seen a Bowie knife.<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>\n\nThe Bowie knife found its greatest popularity in the [[Old Southwest]] of the mid-19th century. However, accounts of Bowie knife fighting schools are based on fiction; newspapers of the era in the region contained advertisements for classes in fencing and self-defense.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-931464-12-3 | pages = 312 }}  Chapter 11: \"Bowie Knife Duels, Rules, Manuals ... and Schools - Dueling in American Folkways and Folklore\"  \"... &nbsp;the evidence for \"knife schools in all the major cities\" fails to support or corroborate their presence.\"  [[Charles Dickens]]' fictional [[Great Expectations]] was quoted as proof of the existence of knife fighting schools.</ref>\n\nBowie knives had a role in the American conflicts of the nineteenth century. They are historically mentioned in the independence of Texas, in the Mexican War, the California gold rush, the [[Bleeding Kansas|civil strife in Kansas]], the Civil War and later conflicts with the American Indians.  [[John Brown (abolitionist)]] carried a Bowie (which was taken by [[J. E. B. Stuart]]). (p 117)  [[John Wilkes Booth]] (assassin of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) dropped a large Bowie knife as he escaped. (p 158)  \"[[Buffalo Bill]]\" Cody ''reportedly'' scalped a sub-chief in 1876 in revenge for Custer (the [[Battle of Warbonnet Creek]]). An illustration of the reputed event showed a Bowie knife. (p 171)<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>\n\nThe popularity of the Bowie knife declined late in the nineteenth century. Large-caliber and reliable [[revolver]]s were available by the mid-1870s, reducing a knife advantage. Prior to the Civil War most handguns were single- or double-barrel muzzle-loaders, and the [[percussion cap]] was considered a great leap forward in reliability even then; multiple shot [[pepperbox]]es and crude revolvers were available, but often in small caliber, highly unreliable, and expensive. The Civil War popularized six-shot [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Smith & Wesson]]-type revolvers which contained a sufficient number of lethal shot to make it possible to carry the firearm alone, without a major backup weapon, unlike earlier pistols which left the user defenseless once they had been fired. The frontier rapidly vanished, reducing the number of hunters and trappers. Large knives had limited utility, so Bowies shrunk.\n\nThe [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Ka-Bar]] of [[World War II]] fame is based on the Bowie design.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Walker  | first = Greg  | title = KA-BAR: The Next Generation of the Ultimate Fighting Knife  | place = Boulder, Colorado  | publisher = Paladin Press   | year = 2001  | isbn = 1-58160-120-4}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, Bowie knives with sawteeth machined into the back side of the blade appeared inspired by the [[Aircrew Survival Egress Knife|United States Air Force survival knife]] (NSN 7340-00-098-4327). The sawteeth were intended to cut through the [[acrylic glass]] canopy of a downed aircraft. During the [[Vietnam War]] the [[United States Army]] issued them to [[helicopter]] crews for the same purpose.\n\nOn July 27, 1969, [[Manson Family|Manson associate]] [[Bobby Beausoleil]] murdered Gary Hinman by stabbing him with a Bowie knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/photo-archive/beausoleil-hinman-murder-knife-01.php|title=Bobby Beausoleil's Bowie Knife and Buckskin Sheath - Charles Manson Family and Sharon Tate-Labianca Murders - Cielodrive.com|author=|date=|website=www.cielodrive.com|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Variations, collecting and portrayal in popular culture ==\nJim Bowie was posthumously inducted into the [[Blade (magazine)|Blade Magazine]] Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in recognition for the impact that his design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.\n\n[[File:Krag Bowie Bayonet.JPG|thumb|Krag Bowie bayonet US stamped, on the reverse date 1900]]\n\nCustom knife maker [[Ernest Emerson]] originally used a Bowie knife in his logo and manufactures a folding Bowie known in his line-up as the CQC13.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Norman | first=Chris| title=Ernest Emerson | journal=Knives Illustrated |volume=10 |issue=4| year=1995 | pages=104\u2013108 }}</ref>\n\nA Bowie knife appears on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the [[39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]], headquartered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].\n\n===Variations===\nAmong the many variations on Bowie knives (discussed or shown by Flayderman or Peterson) are Bowies with interchangeable blades, push daggers, double-ended Bowies, folding Bowies, Bowies with a cork screw or other accessories, Bowie bayonets, combination Bowie/pistols, a Bowie with a saw-toothed back and Confederate Bowies with D-guards. Some were works of fine art. A giant folding Bowie, almost {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length and weighing {{convert|34|lb|kg}} was made for presentation to an American congressman who ''offered'' to engage in a knife duel (a dispute between [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]] and [[John F. Potter]]). A few huge Bowies up to {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long were created for exhibition.\n\nOver the years many knives have been called Bowie knives and the term has almost become a generic term for any large sheath knife. During the early days of the [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers carried immense knives called [[D-Guard Bowie knives]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Many of these knives could have qualified as short [[sword]]s and were often made from old saw or [[scythe]] blades.\n\nThe Bowie knife is sometimes confused with the \"[[Arkansas toothpick]],\" possibly due to the interchangeable use of the names \"Arkansas toothpick\", \"Bowie knife\", and \"Arkansas knife\" in the antebellum period.<ref name=ark/>  The Arkansas toothpick is essentially a heavy [[dagger]] with a straight {{convert|15|-|25|in|cm}} blade. While balanced and weighted for throwing, the toothpick can be used for thrusting and slashing. Although James Black is popularly credited with inventing the \"Arkansas Toothpick\", no firm evidence exists for this claim.<ref name=\"RJ\"/>\n\nKnives made in [[Sheffield]], England, were quick to enter the market with \"Bowie Knives\" of a distinctive pattern that most modern users identify with the true form Bowie. The Sheffield pattern blade is thinner than the Black/Musso knives, while the false edge is often longer, with a more oblique and less pronounced clip edge.<ref name=\"MC\"/>  While the Bowie is often considered a uniquely American knife, most blades were produced in Sheffield England.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J.

The Bowie knife is not well defined. By the mid-20th century most would include some combination of blade length and blade shape. In the mid-19th century, when the popularity of the knife was at its peak, the term was applied to a wide range of blades.<ref>{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Howard L. | title = American Knives; The First History and Collector's Guide | publisher = Gun Room Press | location = Highland Park, N. J. | year = 1958 | page = 26}} Four definitions of \"Bowie\" knives had supporters (in the mid-20th century). All agree that they are sheath knives (basically short swords with a handle and a blade optionally separated by a guard). Some require a blade length; some require a clipped blade; some require both; some require neither for knives produced between 1830 and 1890.</ref>  Absent a consensus definition, it is impossible to clearly define the origin of the knife. To complicate matters, some American blades that meet the modern definition of the Bowie knife may pre-date Bowie.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | page = 345}} \"Nor was the \"clip point\" unknown in America, pre-Jim Bowie.\"  (Accompanied by examples and references.)</ref>\n\nThe Bowie knife derives part of its name and reputation from [[James Bowie]], a notorious [[knife fight]]er, who died at the Alamo. James Bowie left a very thin paper trail; in the absence of verifiable facts, his history was buried in unverifiable knife-fighting legend.

That [[Sandbar Fight]] received national publicity (accounts in Philadelphia, New York, and the ''Niles' Register'' of Washington, D.C.) within months of the event. James Bowie prominently wore a large knife after the Sandbar fight.\n\nThe Bowie family provided a variety of conflicting knife histories. James Bowie left nothing. His brother [[Rezin Bowie]] provided a terse history two years after James' death. Sixteen years after James' death someone (assumed to be James' brother John) slightly amended Rezin's explanation to include a blacksmith. Rezin's grandchildren named a different blacksmith. A later Bowie claimed that the information attributed to John was a lie and that John probably never saw the document, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J.

This cleaver-like blade had enough weight to give the blade sufficient force in a slashing attack, while permitting the use of cut-and-thrust sword fighting tactics.<ref name=\"ROB\"/>  By this time the 'Bowie knife' was already being made in a variety of sizes, with the optimum blade length similar to \"that of a carving knife\".<ref name=\"ROB\">[[Joseph Clinton Robertson|Robertson, J.

The back of the blade sometimes had a strip of soft metal (normally [[brass]] or [[copper]]) inlaid which some believe was intended to catch an opponent's blade while others hold it was intended to provide support and absorb shock to help prevent breaking of poor quality steel or poorly heat treated blades. (A brass back is an indication of modern construction.<ref>{{cite book| last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | pages = 464\u2013466}}  \"[N]o authenticated brass back Bowie has yet to be accepted in all quarters as genuine{{nbsp}}...\".</ref>)  Bowie knives often had an upper guard that bent forward at an angle (an [[S-guard]]) intended to catch an opponent's blade or provide protection to the owner's hand during parries and corps-a-corps.\n\nSome Bowie knives had a notch on the bottom of the blade near the [[hilt]] known as a \"Spanish Notch\". The Spanish Notch is often cited as a mechanism for catching an opponent's blade; however, some Bowie researchers hold that the Spanish Notch is ill-suited to this function and frequently fails to achieve the desired results. These researchers, instead, hold that the Spanish Notch has the much more mundane function as a tool for stripping [[sinew]] and repairing [[rope]] and nets, as a guide to assist in sharpening the blade (assuring that the sharpening process starts at a specific point and not further up the edge), or as a point to relieve stress on the blade during use.\n\nOne characteristic of Bowie knives is the [[clip point]] at the top of the blade, which brings the tip of the blade lower than the spine and in line with the handle for better control during thrusting attacks. As the goal is to produce a sharp, stabbing point, most Bowie knives have a bevel ground along the clip, typically 1/4 of the way, but sometimes much further running the entire top-edge. This is referred to as a [[false edge]] as from a distance it looks sharpened, although it may or may not be. Regardless of whether or not the false edge is sharp, it serves to take metal away from the point, streamlining the tip and thus enhancing the penetration capability of the blade during a stab. The version attributed to blacksmith James Black had this false edge fully sharpened in order to allow someone trained in European techniques of [[Sabre (fencing)|saber fencing]] to execute the maneuver called the \"back cut\" or \"back slash\"..<ref name=\"MC\"/>  A brass [[quillon]], usually cast in a mold, was attached to protect the hand.\n\nThe Bowie knife's design also lends itself to use as a hunting knife for skinning or butchering game. The curved top clip bevel of the blade, when suitably sharpened, may be used to remove the skin from a [[Cadaver|carcass]], while the straight portion of the blade edge, toward the guard, can be used for cutting meat. Arkansas culturalist and researcher Russell T. Johnson describes the [[James Black knife]] in the following manner and at the same time captures the quintessence of the Bowie Knife: \"It must be long enough to use as a sword, sharp enough to use as a razor, wide enough to use as a paddle, and heavy enough to use as a hatchet.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/><ref name=\"RJ\"/>  Most such knives intended for hunting are only sharpened on one edge, to reduce the danger of cutting oneself while butchering and [[skinning]] the carcass.\n\n== History ==\n=== The Vidalia Sandbar Fight ===\n[[File:Coffin handle bowie knife.jpg|thumb|right|A coffin-handled Bowie knife]]\n{{Main|Sandbar Fight}}\n\nThe first knife, with which Bowie became famous, allegedly was designed by Jim Bowie's brother Rezin in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana]] and smithed by blacksmith Jesse Clifft out of an old file.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Period court documents indicate that [[Rezin Bowie]] and Clifft were well acquainted with one another. Rezin's granddaughter claimed in an 1885 letter to [[Louisiana State University]] that she personally witnessed Clifft make the knife for her grandfather.\n\nThis knife became famous as the knife used by Bowie at the [[Sandbar Fight]], a famous 1827 [[duel]] between Bowie and several men including a Major Norris Wright of [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  The fight took place on a [[sandbar]] in the [[Mississippi River]] across from [[Natchez, Mississippi]], and is the only documented fight in which Bowie was known to have employed his Bowie knife design. In this battle Bowie was stabbed, shot, and beaten half to death but managed to win the fight using the large knife.<ref name =\"MC\"/>\n\nJim Bowie's older brother John would later claim that the knife at the Sandbar Fight was not Clifft's knife, but a knife specifically made for Bowie by a blacksmith named Snowden.<ref name=\"Shackleford2010\">{{cite book|last=Shackleford|first=Steve |title=Blade's Guide to Knives & Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6NZd17WtWoC&pg=PA307|accessdate=27 January 2012|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-0387-9|page=307}}</ref>\n\n=== James Black's Bowie knife ===\nThe most famous version of the Bowie knife was designed by Jim Bowie and presented to [[Arkansas]] [[blacksmith]] [[James Black (blacksmith)|James Black]] in the form of a carved wooden model in December 1830.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Black produced the knife ordered by Bowie, and at the same time created another based on Bowie's original design but with a sharpened edge on the curved top edge of the blade.

Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife's death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade.\n\nBlack's knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true [[Damascus steel]].<ref name=\"RJ\"/>\n\nIn 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, [[Daniel Webster Jones (governor)|Daniel Webster Jones]]. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.\n\nThe birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the [[Old Washington Historic State Park]] which has over 40 restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black's shop. The park is known as \"The [[Colonial Williamsburg]] of Arkansas\". The [[American Bladesmith Society]] established the [[William F.

(p 158)  \"[[Buffalo Bill]]\" Cody ''reportedly'' scalped a sub-chief in 1876 in revenge for Custer (the [[Battle of Warbonnet Creek]]). An illustration of the reputed event showed a Bowie knife. (p 171)<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>\n\nThe popularity of the Bowie knife declined late in the nineteenth century. Large-caliber and reliable [[revolver]]s were available by the mid-1870s, reducing a knife advantage. Prior to the Civil War most handguns were single- or double-barrel muzzle-loaders, and the [[percussion cap]] was considered a great leap forward in reliability even then; multiple shot [[pepperbox]]es and crude revolvers were available, but often in small caliber, highly unreliable, and expensive. The Civil War popularized six-shot [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Smith & Wesson]]-type revolvers which contained a sufficient number of lethal shot to make it possible to carry the firearm alone, without a major backup weapon, unlike earlier pistols which left the user defenseless once they had been fired. The frontier rapidly vanished, reducing the number of hunters and trappers. Large knives had limited utility, so Bowies shrunk.\n\nThe [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Ka-Bar]] of [[World War II]] fame is based on the Bowie design.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Walker  | first = Greg  | title = KA-BAR: The Next Generation of the Ultimate Fighting Knife  | place = Boulder, Colorado  | publisher = Paladin Press   | year = 2001  | isbn = 1-58160-120-4}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, Bowie knives with sawteeth machined into the back side of the blade appeared inspired by the [[Aircrew Survival Egress Knife|United States Air Force survival knife]] (NSN 7340-00-098-4327). The sawteeth were intended to cut through the [[acrylic glass]] canopy of a downed aircraft. During the [[Vietnam War]] the [[United States Army]] issued them to [[helicopter]] crews for the same purpose.\n\nOn July 27, 1969, [[Manson Family|Manson associate]] [[Bobby Beausoleil]] murdered Gary Hinman by stabbing him with a Bowie knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/photo-archive/beausoleil-hinman-murder-knife-01.php|title=Bobby Beausoleil's Bowie Knife and Buckskin Sheath - Charles Manson Family and Sharon Tate-Labianca Murders - Cielodrive.com|author=|date=|website=www.cielodrive.com|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Variations, collecting and portrayal in popular culture ==\nJim Bowie was posthumously inducted into the [[Blade (magazine)|Blade Magazine]] Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in recognition for the impact that his design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.\n\n[[File:Krag Bowie Bayonet.JPG|thumb|Krag Bowie bayonet US stamped, on the reverse date 1900]]\n\nCustom knife maker [[Ernest Emerson]] originally used a Bowie knife in his logo and manufactures a folding Bowie known in his line-up as the CQC13.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Norman | first=Chris| title=Ernest Emerson | journal=Knives Illustrated |volume=10 |issue=4| year=1995 | pages=104\u2013108 }}</ref>\n\nA Bowie knife appears on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the [[39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]], headquartered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].\n\n===Variations===\nAmong the many variations on Bowie knives (discussed or shown by Flayderman or Peterson) are Bowies with interchangeable blades, push daggers, double-ended Bowies, folding Bowies, Bowies with a cork screw or other accessories, Bowie bayonets, combination Bowie/pistols, a Bowie with a saw-toothed back and Confederate Bowies with D-guards. Some were works of fine art. A giant folding Bowie, almost {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length and weighing {{convert|34|lb|kg}} was made for presentation to an American congressman who ''offered'' to engage in a knife duel (a dispute between [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]] and [[John F. Potter]]). A few huge Bowies up to {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long were created for exhibition.\n\nOver the years many knives have been called Bowie knives and the term has almost become a generic term for any large sheath knife. During the early days of the [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers carried immense knives called [[D-Guard Bowie knives]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Many of these knives could have qualified as short [[sword]]s and were often made from old saw or [[scythe]] blades.\n\nThe Bowie knife is sometimes confused with the \"[[Arkansas toothpick]],\" possibly due to the interchangeable use of the names \"Arkansas toothpick\", \"Bowie knife\", and \"Arkansas knife\" in the antebellum period.<ref name=ark/>  The Arkansas toothpick is essentially a heavy [[dagger]] with a straight {{convert|15|-|25|in|cm}} blade. While balanced and weighted for throwing, the toothpick can be used for thrusting and slashing. Although James Black is popularly credited with inventing the \"Arkansas Toothpick\", no firm evidence exists for this claim.<ref name=\"RJ\"/>\n\nKnives made in [[Sheffield]], England, were quick to enter the market with \"Bowie Knives\" of a distinctive pattern that most modern users identify with the true form Bowie. The Sheffield pattern blade is thinner than the Black/Musso knives, while the false edge is often longer, with a more oblique and less pronounced clip edge.<ref name=\"MC\"/>  While the Bowie is often considered a uniquely American knife, most blades were produced in Sheffield England.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J.
