At an age of 18 years, he attended law school in Vienna which he concluded, in fact, as a doctor, but more and more he began to show interest for literature.\n\nAfter the law studies, he began as a master of ceremonies at Vienna Cabaret Die Hoelle, where he had his first performance in the operetta \"Phryne\" in 1906. From 1903 on he composed first libretti, among others with Robert Bodanzky and made his appearance as an actor in the most different minor parts on many Vienna Cellar Stages and Revue Theatres.\n\nUntil the beginning of [[World War I]] (in which he enlisted himself as a voluntary in 1915) again and again he travelled to Berlin \u2013 the first time in 1907 in order to perform at \"Chat Noir\" \u2013 to act as master of ceremonies at Rudolf Nelson's theatres. In 1914, Gr\u00fcnbaum acted for the first time at Kabarett Simpl, the legendary Vienna Cabaret where he also acted time and again in the time to come. Together with [[Karl Farkas]] he developed in 1922 the so-called \"Doppelconf\u00e9rence\" originated from Hungary and presented at the \"Budapester Orpheum\" of Vienna, and led it to its highest spot.\n\nIn fact, Gr\u00fcnbaum was described by acquaintances as an \"adorable contemporary\", but this fact did not impede him to slap an imperial and royal officer in 1910 at the \"H\u00f6lle\" restaurant when he proclaimed anti-Semitic slogans during the programme. After that, he continued with his performance. Later the officer challenged Gr\u00fcnbaum to a duel during which Gr\u00fcnbaum was injured. In 1914, Gr\u00fcnbaum was infected by the war frenzy and in 1914 he joined military service. In spring of 1916 he fought at the Italian front, but he returned disenchanted and from that time he attracted attention by pacifistic slogans.\n\nFrom 1926, Gr\u00fcnbaum was working at Vienna B\u00fcrgertheater. In 18 stage settings he and Karl Farkas had beautiful girls show their legs with the music of Egon Neumann in \"Journal der Liebe\" and Rita Georg parade in a breeches part. The guest performance of the Marischka revue which began on 1 October 1927 fully fit into this schema. Performance no. 430 of \"Wien lacht wieder\" took place. In thirty stage settings, Gr\u00fcnbaum and [[Karl Farkas]] (music by [[Ralph Benatzky]]) performed last year's pop song revue which had not lost its popularity with 120 players and 900 fancy dresses.\n[[File:Fritz Gr\u00fcnbaum Vienna Zentralfriedhof 1 Tor.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave in Vienna]]\nHe again and again commuted between Berlin and Vienna. In Berlin he acted in films and wrote pop songs, he wrote scripts, in Vienna he was working at different cabarets. In 1933, his texts became more political in Vienna. On the occasion of one of his last performances at Vienna's [[Cabaret Simpl]] during the programme of \"Metro Gr\u00fcnbaum \u2013 Farkas t\u00f6nende Wochenschau\", he was still joking: \"I see nothing, absolutely nothing, I think I got astray in national socialist culture.\"\n\n==Last years and death==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nOn 10 March 1938, the day German troops marched into the alpine republic, together with Karl Farkas he was acting for the last time in ''Simplicissimus''. After that, they were put under stage ban. The next day, he tried to flee to Czechoslovakia, but he and his wife were sent back at the border. He hid quite a while in Vienna, but then he was betrayed and transported to the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. Later he was taken to [[Buchenwald]] and subsequently returned to Dachau. He died at the Dachau concentration camp on 14 January 1941 after having acted for a last time on New Year's Eve for his fellow-sufferers. A star was dedicated to him on the cabaret Walk of Fame.{{Where|date=January 2018}} He is buried at Vienna Central Cemetery, Old Israelite Part, Gate 1.\n\n==Marriages==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nFritz Gr\u00fcnbaum was married three times.
