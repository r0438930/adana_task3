''Let No Man Write My Epitaph'' was a 1960 Hollywood movie featuring Fitzgerald.\n\nUntil 2014 this album was only available on CD as '''''The Intimate Ella''''', and is considered one of Ella's greatest recordings. Ella's 1950 [[Decca Records|Decca]] album ''[[Ella Sings Gershwin]]'', is in a similar vein, with Ella accompanied by the pianist [[Ellis Larkins]].\n\nThe album hints at a depth of emotional understanding that critics often complained was missing in Ella's reading of jazz lyrics, and once again establishes her as one of the supreme interpreters of the [[Great American Songbook]]. Scott Yanow's review of the album (on Allmusic) declared, \"Listeners who [think] Ella Fitzgerald... had trouble giving the proper emotional intensity to lyrics will be surprised by this sensitive and often haunting set\".\n\nIn 2020, the album was rereleased as part of the Verve compilation ''The Complete Piano Duets''.\n\n==Track listing==\nFor the 1960 Verve LP release; Verve MG V-4043; Re-issued as ''The Intimate Ella'' in 1989 on CD, Verve-PolyGram 839 838-2; Re-issued under its original title and release number in 2014 on CD/SACD\n\nSide One:\n# \"[[Black Coffee (1948 song)|Black Coffee]]\" ([[Sonny Burke]], [[Paul Francis Webster]]) \u2013 3:27\n# \"[[Angel Eyes (1953 song)|Angel Eyes]]\" ([[Earl Brent]], [[Matt Dennis]]) \u2013 3:27\n# \"[[I Cried for You]]\" ([[Gus Arnheim]], [[Arthur Freed]], [[Abe Lyman]]) \u2013 3:26\n# \"[[I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby]]\" ([[Dorothy Fields]], [[Jimmy McHugh]]) \u2013 3:28\n# \"Then You've Never Been Blue\" ([[Ted Fio Rito]], [[Sam M.
