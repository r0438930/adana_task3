A two-time winner of the [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|Road Race World Championship]] (1983 and 1989) and a three-time winner of the [[Tour de France]] (1986, 1989, and 1990), LeMond is considered by many to be the greatest [[Americans|American]] cyclist of all time. \n\nLeMond began his professional cycling career in 1981. In 1983, he became the first American male cyclist to win the Road World Championship. LeMond won the Tour de France in 1986; he is the first non-European professional cyclist to win the Tour. He was accidentally shot with pellets and seriously injured while hunting in 1987. Following the shooting, he underwent two surgeries and missed the next two Tours. At the [[1989 Tour de France|1989 Tour]], he completed an improbable comeback to win in dramatic fashion on the race's final stage. He successfully defended his Tour title the following year, becoming one of only seven riders to win three or more Tours. LeMond retired from competition in December 1994 and was inducted into the [[United States Bicycling Hall of Fame]] in 1996. He was the first professional cyclist to sign a million-dollar contract and the first cyclist to appear on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. \n\nDuring his career, LeMond championed several technological advancements in pro cycling, including the introduction of [[Triathlon bars#Triathlon or aero bars|aerodynamic \"triathlon\" handlebars]] and [[Bicycle frame#Carbon fiber|carbon fiber bicycle frames]],<ref name=\"Walsh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calfeedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cycle-Sport-Feature-Calfee-Design-and-Greg-Lemond.pdf|title=A Meeting of Minds|last=Walsh|first=Matt|work=Cycle Sport|access-date=December 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116012911/http://www.calfeedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cycle-Sport-Feature-Calfee-Design-and-Greg-Lemond.pdf|archive-date=November 16, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> which he later marketed through his company [[LeMond Racing Cycles|LeMond Bicycles]].

I'm watching my weight. I need to build my power and strength up as high as I can and then worry about my endurance. Endurance is the easiest aspect to build up. What I'm doing now is the opposite of what I've been doing, always working on my endurance. Except in 1989, when I did a lot of power training in the winter and that year I had great results as early as February. I'm not going to rush.

A two-time winner of the [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|Road Race World Championship]] (1983 and 1989) and a three-time winner of the [[Tour de France]] (1986, 1989, and 1990), LeMond is considered by many to be the greatest [[Americans|American]] cyclist of all time. \n\nLeMond began his professional cycling career in 1981. In 1983, he became the first American male cyclist to win the Road World Championship. LeMond won the Tour de France in 1986; he is the first non-European professional cyclist to win the Tour. He was accidentally shot with pellets and seriously injured while hunting in 1987. Following the shooting, he underwent two surgeries and missed the next two Tours. At the [[1989 Tour de France|1989 Tour]], he completed an improbable comeback to win in dramatic fashion on the race's final stage. He successfully defended his Tour title the following year, becoming one of only seven riders to win three or more Tours. LeMond retired from competition in December 1994 and was inducted into the [[United States Bicycling Hall of Fame]] in 1996. He was the first professional cyclist to sign a million-dollar contract and the first cyclist to appear on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. \n\nDuring his career, LeMond championed several technological advancements in pro cycling, including the introduction of [[Triathlon bars#Triathlon or aero bars|aerodynamic \"triathlon\" handlebars]] and [[Bicycle frame#Carbon fiber|carbon fiber bicycle frames]],<ref name=\"Walsh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calfeedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cycle-Sport-Feature-Calfee-Design-and-Greg-Lemond.pdf|title=A Meeting of Minds|last=Walsh|first=Matt|work=Cycle Sport|access-date=December 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116012911/http://www.calfeedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cycle-Sport-Feature-Calfee-Design-and-Greg-Lemond.pdf|archive-date=November 16, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> which he later marketed through his company [[LeMond Racing Cycles|LeMond Bicycles]].

A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped keep him out of trouble. \"I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today.
