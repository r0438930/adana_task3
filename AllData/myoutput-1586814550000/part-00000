It was the capital of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. The ruins of the city are located in the [[Samaria]] mountains of the [[West Bank]], almost 10 km to the northwest of [[Nablus]].\n\n==History==\nIsraelite Shomron (lit. \"watch-tower\"; also written \"Shomeron\") was located in the heart of the mountains of [[Samaria]], a few miles northwest of [[Shechem]]. The ruins of the Israelite town, as well the ruins of towns built at this same location later in history, are all adjacent or within the modern [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]]. \n \nThe \"hill of Shomron\" is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. According to biblical tradition, [[Omri]], the king of the northern kingdom of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] (reigned c. 870s BC), purchased this hill from [[Shemer (biblical figure)|Shemer]] its owner for two [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of \"Shomron\", i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:24|KJV}}). As such it possessed many advantages. Omri resided here during the last six years of his reign.<!--these paragraphs read like plagiarism-->\n\nOmri is thought to have granted the Arameans the right to \"make streets in Samaria\" as a sign of submission ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:34|KJV}}).

In the days of [[Ahab]], Benhadad II came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:1\u201321|KJV}}). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:28\u201334|KJV}}), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than \"two little flocks of kids.\"\n\nBiblical tradition also holds that in the days of [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke off the siege, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famished inhabitants of the city were soon relieved from the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that \"a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of [[barley]] for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria\" ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|7:1\u201320|KJV}}).\n\nAccording to [[Josephus]], the ancient name of the site ''Shomron'' (Samaria) was changed to ''[[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]]'' by King [[Herod the Great]], in honor of [[Augustus Caesar]].<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D15%3Asection%3D292 15.8.5.]</ref> .\n\n===Assyrian invasion===\n[[File:SamariaHellenisticTower.JPG|right|thumb|[[Hellenistic]] tower from the inside.]]\nDuring the reign of the last king of the northern kingdom, [[Hoshea]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|10|KJV}}), the [[Assyria]]ns invaded in 722/721 BC.

The fragment of a stela with an Assyrian inscription attributed to Sargon II was found on the eastern slope of the acropolis testifying to their presence. In addition, according to inscriptions from Sargon's palace at [[Khorsabad]], the inhabitants of Samaria were deported to Assyria.\n\n{{quote|[the Samar]ians [who had agreed with a hostile king]. ...

New inhabitants were brought in (from [[Kutha]] and the Syro-Mesopotamian area, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|17:24|KJV}}) and they formed a new [[Samaritan]] population, also known as [[Cuthim]]. The city together with the neighboring highland area became known as Samerina and was ruled by an Assyrian governor. There are only meager remains from the succeeding [[Babylonia]]n period and it was only in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period, in the mid 5th century, that the city reemerged in importance. The tensions between the ruling family of [[Sanballat the Horonite|Sanballat]] and [[Jerusalem]] under the governorship of [[Nehemiah]] are documented in the Bible ({{bibleverse||Ezra|4:10|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Neh|4:7\u20138|KJV}}). Samaria became a [[Hellenistic]] town in 332 BC and thousands of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] soldiers were settled there following a revolt by the Samaritans. Three 13 m diameter round towers dating to that period have been excavated (the first two by Harvard who attributed them to the Israelite period) and a later, massive, fortification wall with square towers. These fortifications were breached during the destruction of the city by [[John Hyrcanus]] in 108. Traces of the destruction wrought by Hyrcanus were found by the excavators, but the city was apparently resettled under [[Alexander Yannai]]. In 63 BC Samaria was annexed to the Roman province of Syria.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Sebaste===\n[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 052.jpg|right|thumb|Base of [[Augusteum]] temple at summit of the hilltop, originally 25 metres high.]]\nIn 30 BC the emperor [[Augustus]] awarded the city to [[Herod the Great]] who renamed it '''Sebaste''' ({{Lang-he-n|'''\u05e1\u05d1\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9'''}}), in honor of Augustus (\"Sebaste\" is the feminine form of Gr. [[Sebastos]] = Augustus). The outstanding remains from this period are; the [[Augusteum]], consisting of a temple and a large forecourt built over the Omride palace at the summit of the acropolis; a city gate and an east-west colonnaded street; a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theater]] on the north-east slope of the acropolis; a Temple to [[Persephone|Kore]] on a terrace north of the acropolis, and a stadium to the north-east in the valley below. East of the acropolis, and in an area that today links the ancient city with the modern village of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]], lies the forum flanked on the west by a partially excavated basilica. Water for Roman Sebaste was provided by an underground aqueduct that led into the area of the forum from springs in the east. The city was encompassed by a city wall 2\u00bd miles (4&nbsp;km) long, with imposing towers that linked the gateways in the west and north. A number of mausoleums with ornate sarcophagi were excavated in the area of the modern village and adjoining fields.\n\n===New Testament===\nIn {{bibleverse||Acts|8:4\u201313|NKJV}} it is recorded that [[Philip the Evangelist]] went down to the city of Samaria and preached the Christian gospel and healed the sick there. [[Simon Magus|Simon the Magician]], a noted sorcerer, was among those converted.\n\n===Roman reconstruction and later===\n[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 085.jpg|thumb|right|[[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine church]] entrance.]]\n[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 099.jpg|thumb|right|Byzantine church]]\nThe city was rebuilt without any major changes in the 2nd century&nbsp;AD by [[Septimius Severus]] when the city was established as a colony. \n\nSamaria has been associated with [[John the Baptist]], whose body was believed to be buried there. \nIn about August 362 AD, in continuation of his policy against Christianity, Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], more commonly known as Julian the [[Apostasy#Christianity|Apostate]] and who was based in [[Antioch]], in the course of the [[Julian's Persian expedition|Persian expedition]], ordered the destruction of the tomb of John the Baptist and the cremation of his body; the event was recorded by historian and theologian [[Tyrannius Rufinus]]. A small basilica church, first founded in the 5th century, was excavated on the southern slope of the acropolis. The church was believed to be the burial place of the head of John the Baptist. A monastery was added to it at a later date. \n\nIn the 12th century AD, a Latin (i.e. [[Catholic Church|Western or Catholic]]) cathedral also dedicated to John the Baptist was built east of the Roman forum and combined elements of the Roman period city wall. It later became the Sebaste village mosque, the [[Nabi Yahya Mosque]] (\"mosque of the Prophet John\"), preserving the old Christian tradition.\n\n===Modern era===\nIn 1867, visitors found the village to have a population of 400, 'almost all Moslems'.<ref>Ellen Clare Miller, 'Eastern Sketches \u2013 notes of scenery, schools and tent life in Syria and Palestine'. Edinburgh: William Oliphant and Company. 1871. p. 179: 'stigmatized in guide-books as remarkable for rudeness and fanaticism' although this was not Ms Miller's experience.</ref>\n\nIn late 1976, the Israeli settlers movement, [[Gush Emunim]], attempted to establish a settlement at the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] train station. The Israeli government did not approve and the group that was removed from the site would later found the settlement of [[Elon Moreh]] adjacent to [[Nablus]]/[[Shechem]].\n\n==Archaeology==\nThe site was first excavated by the Harvard Expedition, initially directed by [[Gottlieb Schumacher]] in 1908 and then by [[George Andrew Reisner]] in 1909 and 1910; with the assistance of architect C.S. Fisher and D.G. Lyon.<ref>Reisner, G. A.; C.S. Fisher, and D.G. Lyon (1924). ''Harvard Excavations at Samaria, 1908\u20131910''.

The palace was excavated solely by the Harvard Expedition and recognized by them as the Palace of Omri (designated Building Period I). The Omride palace was located on an elevated 4 meter high rock-cut platform that isolated it from its immediate surroundings. While immediately below the palace, cut into the face of the bedrock platform, there are two rock-cut tomb chambers that have only recently been recognized and attributed to Omri and Ahab. West of the palace there are meager remains of other Building Period I buildings but much of the rock surface has been severely damaged by later buildings.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Israelite city, Building Period II===\n[[File:Palace in the Kingdom of Israel \u00b7 HHWII77.svg|left|200px|thumb|An artist's depiction of a royal palace in the Kingdom of Israel.]]\nThe Omride palace continued in use during the next building phase (designated Building Period II), but it was no longer isolated on an elevated platform. The acropolis area was extended in all direction by the addition of a massive perimeter wall built in the casemate style; the new enlarged rectangular acropolis measured c. 290&nbsp;ft. (90 m.) from north to south and at least c. 585&nbsp;ft. (180 m.) from west to east (that is a capacity of approximately 7,500 persons by current fire standards), and the surface was now raised to a uniform elevation by the addition of a massive fill. This phase (Building Period II) was traditionally attributed to Ahab due to the misallocation of Wall 161 that run parallel to the northern casemates and the identification of a large rock-cut pool near the northern casemate wall as the Biblical \"Pool of Samaria\"; the wall (Wall 161) is now recognized to belong to Building Period II and the \"pool\" is a rock-cut grape-treading area that originated in Building Period 0 and continued in a reduced form in Building Period I. Consequently, the onset of Building Period II can only be relatively fixed. There is neither a biblical anchor nor securely dated pottery to establish the chronological affiliation of Building Period II.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe Omride Palace was still in use and the royal tombs were still accessible (now via subterranean rooms) and there was an administrative building the [[Ostraca House]] (due to the 63 ostraca retrieved from the floor's make-up) built west of the palace on the newly extended acropolis. The ostraca provide a wealth of data concerning oil and wine supplies, and can possibly be attributed to the period of [[Jeroboam II]] c. 785\u2013749, thus providing a probable date for Building Period II. North of the palace a rich cache of Phoenician ivories were retrieved, these were mixed with later debris but it was presumed by the excavators that it was in this area that the \"Ivory House\" that [[Ahab]] built for [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]] 1 Kings 22:39 stood. North-east and below the acropolis a number of Iron Age tombs were found and their location probably delimits the area of the city in that direction. In essence only the acropolis was excavated down to the Iron Age but it is presumed by the excavators that the city extended down over the northern and southern slopes of the hill.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cities of the ancient Near East]]\n*[[Short chronology timeline]]\n*[[List of modern names for biblical place names]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tappy, R.

The city together with the neighboring highland area became known as Samerina and was ruled by an Assyrian governor. There are only meager remains from the succeeding [[Babylonia]]n period and it was only in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period, in the mid 5th century, that the city reemerged in importance. The tensions between the ruling family of [[Sanballat the Horonite|Sanballat]] and [[Jerusalem]] under the governorship of [[Nehemiah]] are documented in the Bible ({{bibleverse||Ezra|4:10|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Neh|4:7\u20138|KJV}}). Samaria became a [[Hellenistic]] town in 332 BC and thousands of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] soldiers were settled there following a revolt by the Samaritans. Three 13 m diameter round towers dating to that period have been excavated (the first two by Harvard who attributed them to the Israelite period) and a later, massive, fortification wall with square towers. These fortifications were breached during the destruction of the city by [[John Hyrcanus]] in 108. Traces of the destruction wrought by Hyrcanus were found by the excavators, but the city was apparently resettled under [[Alexander Yannai]]. In 63 BC Samaria was annexed to the Roman province of Syria.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Sebaste===\n[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 052.jpg|right|thumb|Base of [[Augusteum]] temple at summit of the hilltop, originally 25 metres high.]]\nIn 30 BC the emperor [[Augustus]] awarded the city to [[Herod the Great]] who renamed it '''Sebaste''' ({{Lang-he-n|'''\u05e1\u05d1\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9'''}}), in honor of Augustus (\"Sebaste\" is the feminine form of Gr. [[Sebastos]] = Augustus). The outstanding remains from this period are; the [[Augusteum]], consisting of a temple and a large forecourt built over the Omride palace at the summit of the acropolis; a city gate and an east-west colonnaded street; a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theater]] on the north-east slope of the acropolis; a Temple to [[Persephone|Kore]] on a terrace north of the acropolis, and a stadium to the north-east in the valley below. East of the acropolis, and in an area that today links the ancient city with the modern village of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]], lies the forum flanked on the west by a partially excavated basilica. Water for Roman Sebaste was provided by an underground aqueduct that led into the area of the forum from springs in the east. The city was encompassed by a city wall 2\u00bd miles (4&nbsp;km) long, with imposing towers that linked the gateways in the west and north. A number of mausoleums with ornate sarcophagi were excavated in the area of the modern village and adjoining fields.\n\n===New Testament===\nIn {{bibleverse||Acts|8:4\u201313|NKJV}} it is recorded that [[Philip the Evangelist]] went down to the city of Samaria and preached the Christian gospel and healed the sick there. [[Simon Magus|Simon the Magician]], a noted sorcerer, was among those converted.\n\n===Roman reconstruction and later===\n[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 085.jpg|thumb|right|[[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine church]] entrance.]]\n[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 099.jpg|thumb|right|Byzantine church]]\nThe city was rebuilt without any major changes in the 2nd century AD by [[Septimius Severus]] when the city was established as a colony. Samaria has been associated with [[John the Baptist]], whose body was believed to be buried there. \nIn about August 362 AD, in continuation of his policy against Christianity, Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], more commonly known as Julian the [[Apostasy#Christianity|Apostate]] and who was based in [[Antioch]], in the course of the [[Julian's Persian expedition|Persian expedition]], ordered the destruction of the tomb of John the Baptist and the cremation of his body; the event was recorded by historian and theologian [[Tyrannius Rufinus]]. A small basilica church, first founded in the 5th century, was excavated on the southern slope of the acropolis. The church was believed to be the burial place of the head of John the Baptist. A monastery was added to it at a later date. In the 12th century AD, a Latin (i.e. [[Catholic Church|Western or Catholic]]) cathedral also dedicated to John the Baptist was built east of the Roman forum and combined elements of the Roman period city wall. It later became the Sebaste village mosque, the [[Nabi Yahya Mosque]] (\"mosque of the Prophet John\"), preserving the old Christian tradition.\n\n===Modern era===\nIn 1867, visitors found the village to have a population of 400, 'almost all Moslems'.<ref>Ellen Clare Miller, 'Eastern Sketches \u2013 notes of scenery, schools and tent life in Syria and Palestine'. Edinburgh: William Oliphant and Company. 1871. p. 179: 'stigmatized in guide-books as remarkable for rudeness and fanaticism' although this was not Ms Miller's experience.</ref>\n\nIn late 1976, the Israeli settlers movement, [[Gush Emunim]], attempted to establish a settlement at the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] train station. The Israeli government did not approve and the group that was removed from the site would later found the settlement of [[Elon Moreh]] adjacent to [[Nablus]]/[[Shechem]].\n\n==Archaeology==\nThe site was first excavated by the Harvard Expedition, initially directed by [[Gottlieb Schumacher]] in 1908 and then by [[George Andrew Reisner]] in 1909 and 1910; with the assistance of architect C.S. Fisher and D.G. Lyon.<ref>Reisner, G. A.; C.S. Fisher, and D.G. Lyon (1924). ''Harvard Excavations at Samaria, 1908\u20131910''.

Crowfoot. The leading institutions were the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]], and the [[Hebrew University]].<ref>Crowfoot, J. W.; G.M. Crowfoot (1938).

The palace was excavated solely by the Harvard Expedition and recognized by them as the Palace of Omri (designated Building Period I). The Omride palace was located on an elevated 4 meter high rock-cut platform that isolated it from its immediate surroundings. While immediately below the palace, cut into the face of the bedrock platform, there are two rock-cut tomb chambers that have only recently been recognized and attributed to Omri and Ahab. West of the palace there are meager remains of other Building Period I buildings but much of the rock surface has been severely damaged by later buildings.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Israelite city, Building Period II===\n[[File:Palace in the Kingdom of Israel \u00b7 HHWII77.svg|left|200px|thumb|An artist's depiction of a royal palace in the Kingdom of Israel.]]\nThe Omride palace continued in use during the next building phase (designated Building Period II), but it was no longer isolated on an elevated platform. The acropolis area was extended in all direction by the addition of a massive perimeter wall built in the casemate style; the new enlarged rectangular acropolis measured c. 290&nbsp;ft. (90 m.) from north to south and at least c. 585&nbsp;ft. (180 m.) from west to east (that is a capacity of approximately 7,500 persons by current fire standards), and the surface was now raised to a uniform elevation by the addition of a massive fill. This phase (Building Period II) was traditionally attributed to Ahab due to the misallocation of Wall 161 that run parallel to the northern casemates and the identification of a large rock-cut pool near the northern casemate wall as the Biblical \"Pool of Samaria\"; the wall (Wall 161) is now recognized to belong to Building Period II and the \"pool\" is a rock-cut grape-treading area that originated in Building Period 0 and continued in a reduced form in Building Period I. Consequently, the onset of Building Period II can only be relatively fixed. There is neither a biblical anchor nor securely dated pottery to establish the chronological affiliation of Building Period II.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe Omride Palace was still in use and the royal tombs were still accessible (now via subterranean rooms) and there was an administrative building the [[Ostraca House]] (due to the 63 ostraca retrieved from the floor's make-up) built west of the palace on the newly extended acropolis. The ostraca provide a wealth of data concerning oil and wine supplies, and can possibly be attributed to the period of [[Jeroboam II]] c. 785\u2013749, thus providing a probable date for Building Period II. North of the palace a rich cache of Phoenician ivories were retrieved, these were mixed with later debris but it was presumed by the excavators that it was in this area that the \"Ivory House\" that [[Ahab]] built for [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]] 1 Kings 22:39 stood. North-east and below the acropolis a number of Iron Age tombs were found and their location probably delimits the area of the city in that direction. In essence only the acropolis was excavated down to the Iron Age but it is presumed by the excavators that the city extended down over the northern and southern slopes of the hill.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cities of the ancient Near East]]\n*[[Short chronology timeline]]\n*[[List of modern names for biblical place names]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tappy, R.
