Manju misbehaves with the servants every now and then even over petty issues,daily reports of which reaches her father's ears courtesy to the manager([[Panchanan Bhattacharya(actor)]]) of the house.Annoyed by Manju's persistent mischief,her father is determined to marry her off an highly educated guy from an affluent family well known to him, against her daughter's will.\n\nOne day,they headed for a trip to [[Somra]],with the father's intention of the engagement ceremony to be held there . According to his plan,they are joined by Asit(the guy the father has chosen for Manju)on the way which surprises Manju as it was completely suppressed to her. On the way, Asit tries to impress her but his too benevolent gesture and funny mannarisms increasingly annoy Manju,who tricks him and her sleeping father to escape with only a briefcase which has the Bengali letter \"Mo\"(Initial letter of her name) inscribed on it and boards a different train where she accidentally meets Rajat,who is on his way to [[Patna]].She has to seek help from him as she has no ticket and she is pennyless too. Initially reluctant,Rajat finally saves her from humiliation by letting his own ticket to be borrowed by her to show to the checker while he himself pretends to be a passanger without ticket thus deposits the amount including fine.He soon deduces Manju's exact identity from the advertisement for missing in classified columns of multiple newspapers given by her father with detailed description of her and also with the announcement of a prize money of 10000 rupees.In dire need of money,Rajat plots a plan to claim the bounty.He persuades Manju to travel with him by letting her know about his knowledge of her real identity while on the other hand he writes a letter to her anxious father and promises to update him regularly on their whereabouts.\nReaching Patna,they board in an inn owned by a Bengali middle-aged man named Chakrabortymoshai/Chokkottimoshai ([[Tulsi Chakraborty]]).They book a room as a newly wed couple.While Rajat carries on playing his part of 'the husband' very smartly ,it was Manju's awkwardness which instills suspicion in clever Chakraborty's mind who himself also after going through the newspaper deduces the truth.In an attempt to grab the opportunity, Chakraborty together with his wife ([[Rajlakshmi Debi]]) tries to keep the couple on hold while planning to report to the police but his plan is foiled by a surprise arrival of Banku ([[Jiben Bose]]),a frequent customer of the inn who happens to be a friend of Rajat's.Surprised at seeing the newly wed Rajat and mistaking them to have come for honeymoon he invites them to his home which Rajat quickly accepts in order to escape Chakraborty.\n\nIn his house,Banku introduces them to his wife ([[Bharati Debi]]) and his 'mejda'(elder brother),who by fate happens to be a self-proclaimed private investigator . Though Rajat and Manju feel much comfortable and at home due to  the cordiality and friendly nature of Banku and his wife ,trouble finds its own way too here in the form of that 'mejda' who soon starts suspecting something fishy about their new guests and gradually investigates out the truth.Meanwhile,Banku's wife arranges a romantic evening for the 'couple' at their rooftop on a full-moon day.Impressed by Rajat's good and simple nature and honesty throughout,Manju,who has now become much softer temperamentally is slowly falling in love with him. She thus goes with the arrangements with an expectation of reciprocation from Rajat,whom she has realised to have developed feelings towards her too.She meets Rajat and tells him that she will wait for his 'answer'.Rajat,on the other hand is in a conflict between his duty towards his boss(so far he slyly let him get updated about their whereabouts) as well his need for money and his newly developed crush on Manju.The night is spent pleasantly,and they shared their thoughts in the form of two songs.However Rajat's message was to terminate any possibility of starting a relationship which disheartens Manju.She decides to step back respectfully.Their good time at Banku's house also comes to  an end as the 'mejda' arranges a meeting with her father.Sensing his plan is now at stake Rajat hurriedly leaves with Manju even without any formal see off.He leaves a letter to explain the situation and also revealing the truth to Banku and his wife,who was stunned and Mejda is disappointed.\n\nNext, Rajat and Manju book a guesthouse for the night's stay.
