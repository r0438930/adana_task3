Synagogues have a large place for prayer (the main [[sanctuary]]) and may also have smaller rooms for study and sometimes a social hall and offices. Some have a separate room for [[Torah study]], called the {{Hebrew|\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9}} ''[[beth midrash]]'', lit. \"house of study\".\n\nSynagogues are consecrated spaces used for the purpose of prayer, reading of the [[Tanakh]] (the entire [[Hebrew Bible]], including the [[Torah]]), study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for [[Jewish prayer|worship]]. [[Halakha]] holds that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever ten Jews (a [[minyan]]) assemble. Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled together. However, halakha considers certain prayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the long-since destroyed [[Temple in Jerusalem]].\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], the word appears 56 times, mostly in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], but also in the [[Gospel of John]] ({{Bibleref2|John 9:22; 18:20}}) and the [[Book of Revelation]] ({{Bibleref2|Rev. 2:9; 3:9}}). It is used in the sense of 'assembly' in the [[Epistle of James]] ({{Bibleref2|James 2:2}}).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[Israelis]] use the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''{{transl|he|beyt knesset}}'' \"house of assembly\". [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have traditionally used the [[Yiddish]] term ''{{transl|yi|shul}}'' (cognate with the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Schule}}, 'school') in everyday speech. [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Romaniote Jews]] generally use the term ''kal'' (from the Hebrew ''\u1e32ahal'', meaning \"community\"). [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish Jews]] call the synagogue a {{lang|es|sinagoga}} and Portuguese Jews call it an {{lang|pt|esnoga}}. [[Persian Jews]] and some [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]] also use the term ''[[kenesa]]'', which is derived from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and some [[Mizrahi Jews]] use ''kenis''.  Some [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews use the word ''temple''. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''synagogue'' is used in [[English language|English]] ([[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and most [[Romance languages|Romance]] languages) to cover the preceding possibilities.<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/shul.htm Judaism 101: Synagogues, Shuls and Temples].

The all-day [[Yom Kippur]] service, in fact, was an event in which the congregation both observed the movements of the ''kohen gadol'' (\"[[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]\") as he offered the day's sacrifices and prayed for his success.\n\nDuring the [[Babylonian captivity]] (586\u2013537&nbsp;BCE){{citation needed|date=July 2018}} the men of the [[Great Assembly]]{{dubious|No proof it ever existed, possible date of creation hardly reaches that far back, no source quoted. Rubbish.|date=July 2018}} formalized and standardized the language of the Jewish prayers. Prior to that people prayed as they saw fit, with each individual praying in his or her own way, and there were no standard prayers that were recited.\n\n[[Johanan ben Zakai]], one of the leaders at the end of the Second Temple era, promulgated the idea of creating individual houses of worship in whatever locale Jews found themselves. This contributed to the continuity of the Jewish people by maintaining a unique identity and a portable way of worship despite the destruction of the Temple, according to many historians.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSynagogues in the sense of purpose-built spaces for worship, or rooms originally constructed for some other purpose but reserved for formal, communal prayer, however, existed long before the destruction of the Second Temple.<ref name=\"pohick\">{{cite web |author=Donald D.

Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish kings, by wealthy patrons, as part of a wide range of human institutions including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels, by the entire community of Jews living in a particular place, or by sub-groups of Jews arrayed according to occupation, ethnicity (i.e. the Sephardic, Polish or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (i.e., a Reform or an Orthodox synagogue), or by the followers of a particular rabbi.\n\nIt has been theorized that the synagogue became a place of worship in the region upon the destruction of the Second Temple during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]; however, others speculate that there had been places of prayer, apart from the Temple, during the Hellenistic period.

For Jews living in the wake of the Revolt, the synagogue functioned as a \"portable system of worship\".

In fact, the influence from other local religious buildings can often be seen in synagogue arches, domes and towers.\n\nHistorically, synagogues were built in the prevailing architectural style of their time and place. Thus, the synagogue in [[Kaifeng|Kaifeng, China]] looked very like Chinese temples of that region and era, with its outer wall and open garden in which several buildings were arranged. The styles of the earliest synagogues resembled the temples of other cults of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The surviving synagogues of medieval Spain are embellished with [[mud\u00e9jar]] plasterwork. The surviving medieval synagogues in [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] are typical [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structures.\n\nWith the emancipation of Jews in Western European countries, which not only enabled Jews to enter fields of enterprise from which they were formerly barred, but gave them the right to build synagogues without needing special permissions, synagogue architecture blossomed. Large Jewish communities wished to show not only their wealth but also their newly acquired status as citizens by constructing magnificent synagogues. These were built across Western Europe and in the United States in all of the historicist or revival styles then in fashion. Thus there were [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Neo-Byzantine]], [[Romanesque Revival]], [[Moorish Revival]], [[Gothic Revival]], and [[Greek Revival]]. There are [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogues and even one [[Mayan Revival]] synagogue. In the 19th century and early 20th century heyday of historicist architecture, however, most historicist synagogues, even the most magnificent ones, did not attempt a pure style, or even any particular style, and are best described as eclectic.\n\nIn the post-war era, synagogue architecture abandoned historicist styles for modernism.<gallery>\nFile:Synagogue Aleppo.jpg|[[Central Synagogue of Aleppo]], [[Aleppo]], Syria (5th century)\nFile:Kochi Jewish Synagogue C.jpg|[[Paradesi Synagogue]], [[Kochi]], India (1568)\nFile:A\u0161kena\u0161ka sinagoga (14143483781).jpg|Sarajevo Synagogue, [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina (1902)\nFile:Sofia Synagogue 11c.jpg|[[Sofia Synagogue]], [[Sofia]], Bulgaria (1909)\nFile:Frank Lloyd Wright - Beth Sholom Synagogue - Elkins Park, PA (7175161021).jpg|[[Beth Sholom Congregation (Elkins Park, Pennsylvania)|Beth Sholom Congregation]], [[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania|Elkins Park]], USA (1959)\nFile:Synagoge muenchen(softeis) ShiftN cropped.jpg|[[Ohel Jakob synagogue (Munich)|Ohel Jakob synagogue]], Munich, Germany (2006)\n</gallery>\n\n==Interior elements==\n===Bimah (platform)===\nAll synagogues contain a ''[[Bema#Judaism|Bimah]]'', a large, raised, reader's platform (called {{lang|he-Latn|te\u1e07ah}} (reading dais) by Sephardim), where the Torah scroll is placed to be read.

Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face [[Mizrah|east]], while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem. Occasionally synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.\n\nThe Ark is reminiscent of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which held the tablets inscribed with the [[Ten Commandments]]. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, equivalent to the [[Holy of Holies]].

He then said, 'Had I not gone to the synagogue, my sandals would not have gone-off.'\u201d The custom of never entering a synagogue while wearing one's shoes is also mentioned in the [[Cairo Geniza]] manuscripts: \"While he is yet outside, let him take-off his shoes or sandals from his feet and then enter barefoot, since such is the way of servants to walk barefoot before their lords...

A room or building that is used this way can become a dedicated small synagogue or prayer room. Among Ashkenazi Jews they are traditionally called {{lang|yi-Latn|[[shtiebel]]}} ({{lang|yi|\u05e9\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05dc}}, pl. {{lang|yi-Latn|shtiebelekh}} or {{lang|yi-Latn|shtiebels}}, Yiddish for \"little house\"), and are found in Orthodox communities worldwide.\n\nAnother type of communal prayer group, favored by some contemporary Jews, is the ''[[Chavurah]]'' (\u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, pl. ''chavurot'', \u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea), or prayer fellowship. These groups meet at a regular place and time, either in a private home or in a synagogue or other institutional space.

Synagogues have a large place for prayer (the main [[sanctuary]]) and may also have smaller rooms for study and sometimes a social hall and offices. Some have a separate room for [[Torah study]], called the {{Hebrew|\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9}} ''[[beth midrash]]'', lit. \"house of study\".\n\nSynagogues are consecrated spaces used for the purpose of prayer, reading of the [[Tanakh]] (the entire [[Hebrew Bible]], including the [[Torah]]), study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for [[Jewish prayer|worship]]. [[Halakha]] holds that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever ten Jews (a [[minyan]]) assemble. Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled together. However, halakha considers certain prayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the long-since destroyed [[Temple in Jerusalem]].\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], the word appears 56 times, mostly in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], but also in the [[Gospel of John]] ({{Bibleref2|John 9:22; 18:20}}) and the [[Book of Revelation]] ({{Bibleref2|Rev. 2:9; 3:9}}). It is used in the sense of 'assembly' in the [[Epistle of James]] ({{Bibleref2|James 2:2}}).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[Israelis]] use the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''{{transl|he|beyt knesset}}'' \"house of assembly\". [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have traditionally used the [[Yiddish]] term ''{{transl|yi|shul}}'' (cognate with the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Schule}}, 'school') in everyday speech. [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Romaniote Jews]] generally use the term ''kal'' (from the Hebrew ''\u1e32ahal'', meaning \"community\"). [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish Jews]] call the synagogue a {{lang|es|sinagoga}} and Portuguese Jews call it an {{lang|pt|esnoga}}. [[Persian Jews]] and some [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]] also use the term ''[[kenesa]]'', which is derived from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and some [[Mizrahi Jews]] use ''kenis''.  Some [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews use the word ''temple''. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''synagogue'' is used in [[English language|English]] ([[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and most [[Romance languages|Romance]] languages) to cover the preceding possibilities.<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/shul.htm Judaism 101: Synagogues, Shuls and Temples].

The all-day [[Yom Kippur]] service, in fact, was an event in which the congregation both observed the movements of the ''kohen gadol'' (\"[[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]\") as he offered the day's sacrifices and prayed for his success.\n\nDuring the [[Babylonian captivity]] (586\u2013537&nbsp;BCE){{citation needed|date=July 2018}} the men of the [[Great Assembly]]{{dubious|No proof it ever existed, possible date of creation hardly reaches that far back, no source quoted. Rubbish.|date=July 2018}} formalized and standardized the language of the Jewish prayers. Prior to that people prayed as they saw fit, with each individual praying in his or her own way, and there were no standard prayers that were recited.\n\n[[Johanan ben Zakai]], one of the leaders at the end of the Second Temple era, promulgated the idea of creating individual houses of worship in whatever locale Jews found themselves. This contributed to the continuity of the Jewish people by maintaining a unique identity and a portable way of worship despite the destruction of the Temple, according to many historians.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSynagogues in the sense of purpose-built spaces for worship, or rooms originally constructed for some other purpose but reserved for formal, communal prayer, however, existed long before the destruction of the Second Temple.<ref name=\"pohick\">{{cite web |author=Donald D.

Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish kings, by wealthy patrons, as part of a wide range of human institutions including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels, by the entire community of Jews living in a particular place, or by sub-groups of Jews arrayed according to occupation, ethnicity (i.e. the Sephardic, Polish or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (i.e., a Reform or an Orthodox synagogue), or by the followers of a particular rabbi.\n\nIt has been theorized that the synagogue became a place of worship in the region upon the destruction of the Second Temple during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]; however, others speculate that there had been places of prayer, apart from the Temple, during the Hellenistic period.

In fact, the influence from other local religious buildings can often be seen in synagogue arches, domes and towers.\n\nHistorically, synagogues were built in the prevailing architectural style of their time and place. Thus, the synagogue in [[Kaifeng|Kaifeng, China]] looked very like Chinese temples of that region and era, with its outer wall and open garden in which several buildings were arranged. The styles of the earliest synagogues resembled the temples of other cults of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The surviving synagogues of medieval Spain are embellished with [[mud\u00e9jar]] plasterwork. The surviving medieval synagogues in [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] are typical [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structures.\n\nWith the emancipation of Jews in Western European countries, which not only enabled Jews to enter fields of enterprise from which they were formerly barred, but gave them the right to build synagogues without needing special permissions, synagogue architecture blossomed. Large Jewish communities wished to show not only their wealth but also their newly acquired status as citizens by constructing magnificent synagogues. These were built across Western Europe and in the United States in all of the historicist or revival styles then in fashion. Thus there were [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Neo-Byzantine]], [[Romanesque Revival]], [[Moorish Revival]], [[Gothic Revival]], and [[Greek Revival]]. There are [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogues and even one [[Mayan Revival]] synagogue. In the 19th century and early 20th century heyday of historicist architecture, however, most historicist synagogues, even the most magnificent ones, did not attempt a pure style, or even any particular style, and are best described as eclectic.\n\nIn the post-war era, synagogue architecture abandoned historicist styles for modernism.<gallery>\nFile:Synagogue Aleppo.jpg|[[Central Synagogue of Aleppo]], [[Aleppo]], Syria (5th century)\nFile:Kochi Jewish Synagogue C.jpg|[[Paradesi Synagogue]], [[Kochi]], India (1568)\nFile:A\u0161kena\u0161ka sinagoga (14143483781).jpg|Sarajevo Synagogue, [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina (1902)\nFile:Sofia Synagogue 11c.jpg|[[Sofia Synagogue]], [[Sofia]], Bulgaria (1909)\nFile:Frank Lloyd Wright - Beth Sholom Synagogue - Elkins Park, PA (7175161021).jpg|[[Beth Sholom Congregation (Elkins Park, Pennsylvania)|Beth Sholom Congregation]], [[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania|Elkins Park]], USA (1959)\nFile:Synagoge muenchen(softeis) ShiftN cropped.jpg|[[Ohel Jakob synagogue (Munich)|Ohel Jakob synagogue]], Munich, Germany (2006)\n</gallery>\n\n==Interior elements==\n===Bimah (platform)===\nAll synagogues contain a ''[[Bema#Judaism|Bimah]]'', a large, raised, reader's platform (called {{lang|he-Latn|te\u1e07ah}} (reading dais) by Sephardim), where the Torah scroll is placed to be read.

Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face [[Mizrah|east]], while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem. Occasionally synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.\n\nThe Ark is reminiscent of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which held the tablets inscribed with the [[Ten Commandments]]. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, equivalent to the [[Holy of Holies]].

He then said, 'Had I not gone to the synagogue, my sandals would not have gone-off.'\u201d The custom of never entering a synagogue while wearing one's shoes is also mentioned in the [[Cairo Geniza]] manuscripts: \"While he is yet outside, let him take-off his shoes or sandals from his feet and then enter barefoot, since such is the way of servants to walk barefoot before their lords...

A room or building that is used this way can become a dedicated small synagogue or prayer room. Among Ashkenazi Jews they are traditionally called {{lang|yi-Latn|[[shtiebel]]}} ({{lang|yi|\u05e9\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05dc}}, pl. {{lang|yi-Latn|shtiebelekh}} or {{lang|yi-Latn|shtiebels}}, Yiddish for \"little house\"), and are found in Orthodox communities worldwide.\n\nAnother type of communal prayer group, favored by some contemporary Jews, is the ''[[Chavurah]]'' (\u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, pl.
