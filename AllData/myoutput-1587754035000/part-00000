At peak times of the [[solar cycle]] when many [[sunspots]] appear on the Sun's surface, 10 meters can be alive with extremely long-distance signals, refracting from the [[F region|F2 layer]] in the [[ionosphere]]. Generally speaking, the most effective and efficient propagation of 10-meter radio waves takes place during local daylight hours.  During periods of increased sunspot activity, band openings may begin well before sunrise and continue into the night.\n\nLong-distance opportunities via F2 seem to follow the sun across the globe. In North America, for instance, F2 might bring Europe and western Asia in the morning, the Americas during midday, and the Pacific and East Asia in late afternoon and early evening.\n\nEven in times of [[solar minimum]], when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long distance possibilities. [[Sporadic E propagation]] can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late spring and early summer being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on [[TV-FM DX|transequatorial paths]], for example between Europe and [[Southern Africa]] or between Pacific [[North America]] and the Eastern Pacific islands.\n\nIn tropical latitudes 10 meters is open throughout the sunspot cycle, although propagation is often confined to other areas lying along the equator. For example, a good path from West Africa to the Caribbean exists on 10 meters even at solar minimum.\n\n== 10-meter sub-bands ==\nAlthough 10 meters has a worldwide amateur radio allocation, in some countries the use of portions of 10 meters is allocated by the government by license class, by signal mode or signal bandwidth.

The Novice sub-bands consist of two frequency ranges; one for CW and Data operation, and the other for SSB phone operation.\n\n==== Novice CW ====\n28.000&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz is a very active part of 10 meters for CW operation.\n\n==== Novice/Technician phone ====\n28.300&nbsp;MHz - 28.500&nbsp;MHz is probably the most active part of the 10-meter band. Operation in this segment is almost exclusively SSB worldwide.\n\n=== Beacons ===\nBecause the propagation on 10 meters can vary drastically throughout the day, [[Radio propagation beacon|propagation beacons]] are very important to gauge the current conditions of the band. With some differences in each [[ITU Region]]s and also from country to country, the beacon sub-bands fall between 28.100&nbsp;MHz and 28.300&nbsp;MHz. ITU Region 1 is generally 28.190&nbsp;MHz - 28.225&nbsp;MHz and ITU Region 2 is generally 28.200&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz.\n\nA list of 10-meter propagation beacons is available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons}}</ref>\n\n<!-- <ref>{{cite web |url=http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205121353/http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |archivedate=2012-02-05 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n-->\n\n=== AM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.000&nbsp;MHz to 29.200&nbsp;MHz. Formerly-common practice was to use the band in 10&nbsp;kHz steps: e.g. 29.010, 29.020, 29.030,... etc. This has not been the case since the 1970s, which saw an influx of surplus 23-channel [[Citizens band radio|CB]] equipment modified for use on the 10-meter amateur band. The surplus equipment would land in 10&nbsp;kHz steps on the 5&nbsp;kHz step such as: 29.015, 29.025, 29.035, etc. Users of the surplus equipment also inherited those radios' odd channel spacing, which on CB skipped channels that were not used there, because they were set aside for remote control operations.\n\n=== Satellite sub-band ===\nFrom 29.300&nbsp;MHz to 29.510&nbsp;MHz the satellite sub band allows amateur radio operators to communicate with orbiting [[OSCAR]]s.\n\n==== Satellite operation ====\nMany amateur radio satellites have either an uplink or a downlink in the 29&nbsp;MHz range. Information about particular satellites and operational modes is available from AMSAT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2.amsat.org/ |title=AMSAT-NA |url-status=dead |accessdate=28 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528231659/http://ww2.amsat.org/ |archive-date=2013-05-28 }}</ref> \n\nAs of the current writing, only AO-7's 10m downlink is active.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |title=Operational OSCAR Satellite Status Summary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115132508/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |archivedate=2013-01-15 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> \n\n=== FM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.510&nbsp;MHz to 29.700, The FM sub-band is usually channelized into [[repeater]] and [[Simplex communication|simplex]] frequencies. The channels are commonly grouped into repeater inputs, simplex, and repeater output frequencies.\n\nRepeater Input Channels:\n29.520, 29.540, 29.560, and 29.580&nbsp;MHz.\n\n'''Simplex Channel, Worldwide calling FM: 29.600&nbsp;MHz'''\n\nRepeater Output Channels:\n29.620, 29.640, 29.660, and 29.680&nbsp;MHz.\n\n==== Repeater operation ====\nCommon practice for 10-meter repeaters is to use a 100&nbsp;kHz negative offset for repeater operation. Due to the very few available repeater channels, \"odd-splits\" (offsets differing from 100&nbsp;kHz) and non-standard frequencies are not uncommon. Since 10 meters can frequently open up to propagate globally, most 10-meter repeaters use a [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] sub-audible access tone. 16&nbsp;kHz wide signals with 5&nbsp;kHz deviation is normal in this band. 8&nbsp;kHz narrow signals with 2.5&nbsp;kHz deviation can also be found.\n\n=== FM simplex channels ===\n29.300&nbsp;MHz is a common frequency to find JA hams on. British hams commonly use the 29.400 to 29.500&nbsp;MHz band for FM as well with 29.400, 29.450, and 29.500&nbsp;MHz being common. USA hams can be found on FM anywhere above 29.000&nbsp;MHz, commonly on the above frequencies talking to overseas hams.  29.200 to 29.300&nbsp;MHz is set aside in some area band plans for FM Simplex use.\n\n== Organizations and enthusiasts ==\n* [http://www.ten-ten.org Ten-Ten International]\n* [https://breezeshooters.org/ The Breeze Shooters ARC]\n* [[Hamwave]]\n* [[Margarita & Martini 10-10 Chapter of Georgia]]\n\nDue to its unique nature, 10 meters has a large following of hobbyists who spend most of their time on this frequency band.

Beyond these regulations there is also a general voluntary band plan adhered to by amateurs throughout the world.\n\n=== Worldwide frequency allocations ===\nWorldwide 10 meter frequency allocations are specified by the ITU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/hfband.htm |title=Amateur HF Bands |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range from 28.000 to 29.700&nbsp;MHz.\n\n=== IARU Region 1 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28.000-28.070\n! width= 120px | 28.070-28.190\n! width= 35px | 28.190-28.225\n! width= 400px | 28.225-29.510\n! width= 20px | 29.510-29.520\n! width= 180px | 29.520-29.700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 1\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 2 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 70px | 28.000-28.070\n! width= 120px | 28.070-28.190\n! width= 10px | 28.190-28.300\n! width= 400px | 28.300-29.510\n! width= 20px | 29.510-29.520\n! width= 180px | 29.520-29.700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 2\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n| style=\"background-color: white\" |\n| style=\"background-color: #E8AFF5\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n=== IARU Region 3 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=120px | 10 meters\n! width= 50px | 28000-28050\n! width= 100px | 28050-28150\n! width= 40px | 28150-28190\n! width= 20px | 28190-28200\n! width= 100px | 28200-28300\n! width= 400px | 28300-29700\n\n|-\n| IARU Region 3\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: yellow\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: cyan\" |\n| style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| style=\"background-color: brown\" |\n|-\n\n|}\n\n===USA===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:70%\"\n! width=120px | 10 Meters\n! width=150px | 28000 \u2013 28300\n! width=100px | 28300 \u2013 28500\n! width=600px | 28500 \u2013 29700\n|-\n| Novice / Technician\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n|\n|-\n| General, Advanced, Extra\n| style=\"background-color: orange\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n| style=\"background-color: black\" |\n|}\n\n=== Canada 10 meter band plan ===\nCanada is part of region 2 and as such is subject to the IARU band plan.

The Novice sub-bands consist of two frequency ranges; one for CW and Data operation, and the other for SSB phone operation.\n\n==== Novice CW ====\n28.000&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz is a very active part of 10 meters for CW operation.\n\n==== Novice/Technician phone ====\n28.300&nbsp;MHz - 28.500&nbsp;MHz is probably the most active part of the 10-meter band. Operation in this segment is almost exclusively SSB worldwide.\n\n=== Beacons ===\nBecause the propagation on 10 meters can vary drastically throughout the day, [[Radio propagation beacon|propagation beacons]] are very important to gauge the current conditions of the band. With some differences in each [[ITU Region]]s and also from country to country, the beacon sub-bands fall between 28.100&nbsp;MHz and 28.300&nbsp;MHz. ITU Region 1 is generally 28.190&nbsp;MHz - 28.225&nbsp;MHz and ITU Region 2 is generally 28.200&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz.\n\nA list of 10-meter propagation beacons is available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons}}</ref>\n\n<!-- <ref>{{cite web |url=http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205121353/http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |archivedate=2012-02-05 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n-->\n\n=== AM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.000&nbsp;MHz to 29.200&nbsp;MHz. Formerly-common practice was to use the band in 10&nbsp;kHz steps: e.g. 29.010, 29.020, 29.030,... etc. This has not been the case since the 1970s, which saw an influx of surplus 23-channel [[Citizens band radio|CB]] equipment modified for use on the 10-meter amateur band. The surplus equipment would land in 10&nbsp;kHz steps on the 5&nbsp;kHz step such as: 29.015, 29.025, 29.035, etc. Users of the surplus equipment also inherited those radios' odd channel spacing, which on CB skipped channels that were not used there, because they were set aside for remote control operations.\n\n=== Satellite sub-band ===\nFrom 29.300&nbsp;MHz to 29.510&nbsp;MHz the satellite sub band allows amateur radio operators to communicate with orbiting [[OSCAR]]s.\n\n==== Satellite operation ====\nMany amateur radio satellites have either an uplink or a downlink in the 29&nbsp;MHz range. Information about particular satellites and operational modes is available from AMSAT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2.amsat.org/ |title=AMSAT-NA |url-status=dead |accessdate=28 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528231659/http://ww2.amsat.org/ |archive-date=2013-05-28 }}</ref> \n\nAs of the current writing, only AO-7's 10m downlink is active.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |title=Operational OSCAR Satellite Status Summary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115132508/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |archivedate=2013-01-15 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> \n\n=== FM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.510&nbsp;MHz to 29.700, The FM sub-band is usually channelized into [[repeater]] and [[Simplex communication|simplex]] frequencies. The channels are commonly grouped into repeater inputs, simplex, and repeater output frequencies.\n\nRepeater Input Channels:\n29.520, 29.540, 29.560, and 29.580&nbsp;MHz.\n\n'''Simplex Channel, Worldwide calling FM: 29.600&nbsp;MHz'''\n\nRepeater Output Channels:\n29.620, 29.640, 29.660, and 29.680&nbsp;MHz.\n\n==== Repeater operation ====\nCommon practice for 10-meter repeaters is to use a 100&nbsp;kHz negative offset for repeater operation. Due to the very few available repeater channels, \"odd-splits\" (offsets differing from 100&nbsp;kHz) and non-standard frequencies are not uncommon. Since 10 meters can frequently open up to propagate globally, most 10-meter repeaters use a [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] sub-audible access tone. 16&nbsp;kHz wide signals with 5&nbsp;kHz deviation is normal in this band. 8&nbsp;kHz narrow signals with 2.5&nbsp;kHz deviation can also be found.\n\n=== FM simplex channels ===\n29.300&nbsp;MHz is a common frequency to find JA hams on. British hams commonly use the 29.400 to 29.500&nbsp;MHz band for FM as well with 29.400, 29.450, and 29.500&nbsp;MHz being common. USA hams can be found on FM anywhere above 29.000&nbsp;MHz, commonly on the above frequencies talking to overseas hams.  29.200 to 29.300&nbsp;MHz is set aside in some area band plans for FM Simplex use.\n\n== Organizations and enthusiasts ==\n* [http://www.ten-ten.org Ten-Ten International]\n* [https://breezeshooters.org/ The Breeze Shooters ARC]\n* [[Hamwave]]\n* [[Margarita & Martini 10-10 Chapter of Georgia]]\n\nDue to its unique nature, 10 meters has a large following of hobbyists who spend most of their time on this frequency band. The major group of enthusiasts is Ten-Ten which has been organized since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ten-ten.org/ |title=10-10 International |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=FCCTable>\n{{cite web\n|url         = http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/spectrum/table/fcctable.pdf\n|title       = FCC Online Table of Frequency Allocations\n|date        = June 2, 2011\n|work        = 47 C.F.R.\n|publisher   = Federal Communications Commission\n|format      = PDF\n|accessdate  = 28 May 2013\n|quote       = \n}}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{AmateurRadioBands-MFHF}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:10-meter Band}}\n\n[[Category:Amateur radio bands]]\n", "name_user": "Stereorock", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIARU Region 3", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-meter_band"}
