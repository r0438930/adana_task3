Often associated with the Italian [[Saint]] [[Francis of Assisi]] ({{c.|1182}} \u2013 1226), but entirely absent from his writings, the prayer in its present form has not been traced back further than 1912.<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\"/> Its first known occurrence was in French, in a small spiritual magazine called ''[[La Clochette]]'' (The Little Bell), published by a [[Catholic Church]] organization in Paris named ''La Ligue de la Sainte-Messe'' (The League of the Holy Mass). The author's name was not given, although it may have been the founder of ''La Ligue,'' Father Esther Bouquerel. The prayer was heavily publicized during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201710/what-do-we-know-about-st-francis-americas-most-popular-saint-31161|title=What do we know about St. Francis, America's most popular saint?|last=Manning|first=Kathleen|year=2017|work=[[U.S. Catholic (magazine)|U.S. Catholic]]|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> It has been frequently set to music by notable songwriters and quoted by prominent leaders, and its broadly inclusive language has found appeal with diverse faiths encouraging service to others.<ref name=\"RenouxWeb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.franciscan-archive.org/franciscana/peace.html |title=The Origin of the Peace Prayer of St. Francis |accessdate=25 May 2011 |last=Renoux |first=Christian |publisher=[[The Franciscan Archive]]}}</ref>{{sfn|Renoux|2001|pp=21, 27\u201328}}<ref name=Picucci>{{cite news |first=Egidio |last=Piccuci |date=19\u201320 January 2009 |newspaper=L'Osservatore Romano |page=6 |title=Le origini del testo attribuito a san Francesco d'Assisi: ''L'Osservatore Romano'' e la vera storia della Preghiera semplice |language=Italian}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\nIn most of the published versions of the prayer, the text is abridged, paraphrased or copyrighted.
