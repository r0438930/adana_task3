This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The [[Cabinet Secretary]] stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved.\n\nThe implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed.\n\nThe Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government.\n\nA civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a [[District Magistrate]]'s office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as [[Principal Secretary (India)|Principal Secretaries]]/Financial Commissioners in some states\n\nEach State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]]. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary .\n\nIn the District, the administrative head is the [[District collector|Collector]] or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also.\n\nAt the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue.\n\n===Indian Forest Service (IFS)===\n{{main|Indian Forest Service}}\n\nIndia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the [[Indian Forest Service#Imperial Forest Service (IFS)|Imperial Forest Department]]. In 1866 Dr. [[Dietrich Brandis]], a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. \n \nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in [[Germany]] and [[France]], and from 1885 to 1905 at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[London]], which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University of Edinburgh]] undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers.\n \nFrom 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] (FRI) at [[Dehradun]] (established in 1906). Later The [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Indian Forest College]] (IFC) was established in 1938 at [[Dehradun]], and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. [[Forestry]], which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \"provincial list\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued.\n \nThe modern Indian Forest Service (IFS) was established in 1966, after independence, under the ''All India Services Act 1951'', for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources.\n \nIndia has an area of 635,400&nbsp;km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the [[Concurrent List]].\n\nRanks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, [[Divisional Forest Officer]] (DFOs), \n[[Deputy Conservator of Forests]],\n[[Conservator of Forests]] (CFs),\nChief Conservator of Forests (CCFs),\nAdditional [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (Addl.PCCFs),\n[[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State,\n[[Director General of Forests (India)]] - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states.\n\nThe training at [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] is designed in such a way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the [[ISRO]]'s [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]], [[University of Twente]]/[[ITC Enschede|ITC]] [[Netherlands]] and in Wildlife Management from the [[Wildlife Institute of India]]. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], SAARC Forestry Centre, [[Forest Survey of India]], [[Wildlife Institute of India]], [[Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education]] (ICFRE), [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, [[Wildlife Crime Control Bureau]] (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\n===Indian Police Service (IPS)===\n{{main|Indian Police Service}}\n\nThe Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after [[India]] gained [[Partition of India|independence]] from [[British Raj|Britain]], the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work.\n\nAn IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as its Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers.\n\nThe IPS officer takes charge as an [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]] of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as [[Superintendent of Police]] or [[Deputy commissioner of police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]] and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12-14 years, then as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] or [[Additional Commissioner of Police]] in 15 years, an [[Inspector General of Police]] in 18 years, [[Additional Director General of Police]] in 25 years and finally, the [[Director General of Police]] after 30 years in service.\n\nIPS officers also work in national government agencies such as [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Research and Analysis Wing]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] and the [[Central Industrial Security Force]], etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], [[Consul General]], Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, [[High Commissioner]] and [[Ambassador]].\n\nThe [[Director General of Police]] and [[Commissioner of Police]] is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]]  etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The [[Inspector General#India|Inspector General]] or [[Joint Commissioner of Police]] is at the head of certain specialised police force like [[Criminal Investigation Department]], Special Branch, etc.\n\n==Reforms and changes==\nIn January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| title= Retire non-performing bureaucrats: Centre to states| date= 1 July 2012| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120701135717/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| archivedate= 1 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS lazy retire\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lazy-and-incompetent-babus-to-retire-early/1/162137.html |title=Lazy and incompetent babus to retire early|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"corruption compulsory retirement\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/graft-taint-may-lead-to-retirement-for-babus/1/179684.html |title=Corruption taint may lead to compulsory retirement for babus|author=|date=21 April 2012 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS retire 15 incompetence\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/proposal-to-retire-incompetent-officers-after-15-year-service/20111130.htm |title=Proposal to retire incompetent officers after 15-year service|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Rediff News |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn recommendation by [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-ias-462676| title=Exams for state civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-IAS/articleshow/27861653.cms| title=State civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\nExpected Reforms:\n1) Creation of Indian Medical Service for Doctors\n2) All India Judicial Service- to attract best law talent into the higher judiciary\n3) Indian Education Service- to increase the quality of policy making at Central level\n\n==Disputes in using acronym IFS==\nIndian Forest Service (IFS) is the oldest service and as per the old British records acronym was used to specify the Imperial Forest Service officers. But when the Indian Foreign Service was created (1946) the acronym IFS was also used to address officers belonging to Foreign Service. Strong protests and arguments were raised by the officers of the Indian Forest Service Officers for the wrong and unhealthy practice of addressing the Indian Forest Officers as IFoS  by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). As per their version if they want to change the acronym change the Indian Foreign Service as IFoS or Indian Diplomatic Service to avoid confusion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil Services of India]]\n*[[Special Duty Allowance (SDA)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091220111744/http://www.upsc.gov.in/ais/index.htm All India Services official website]\n* [http://upsc.gov.in/ Union Public Service Commission official website]\n* [http://persmin.nic.in/ Indian Administrative Service official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619060945/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=346 Indian Police Service official website]\n* [http://ifs.nic.in/ Indian Forest Service official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174347/http://persmin.nic.in/ersheet/StartQryERS.asp List of IAS Officers]\n* [https://www.vaidikmart.com/product/desi-cow-bilona-ghee-1-ltr/ All India Desi Ghee Services official website]\n[[Category:All India Services| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Public services in India}}{{Use Indian English|date=January 2019}}{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}\nThe '''All India Services''' ('''AIS''') comprises [[Civil Services of India]], namely the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), the [[Indian Forest Service]] (IFS) <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO INDIAN FOREIGN SERVICE --> and the [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS).<ref name=\"All India Services\">{{cite web|title=All India Services|url=http://www.archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/profile.php?id=32|website=Know India Official website of Government}}</ref> A common unique feature of the All India Services is that the members of these services are recruited by the Centre (Union government in federal polity), but their services are placed under various State cadres, and they have the liability to serve both under the State and under the Centre.<ref name=\"All India Services\"/> Due to the federal polity of the country, this is considered one of the tools that makes union government stronger than state governments.

This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The [[Cabinet Secretary]] stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved.\n\nThe implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed.\n\nThe Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government.\n\nA civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a [[District Magistrate]]'s office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as [[Principal Secretary (India)|Principal Secretaries]]/Financial Commissioners in some states\n\nEach State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]]. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary .\n\nIn the District, the administrative head is the [[District collector|Collector]] or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also.\n\nAt the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue.\n\n===Indian Forest Service (IFS)===\n{{main|Indian Forest Service}}\n\nIndia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the [[Indian Forest Service#Imperial Forest Service (IFS)|Imperial Forest Department]]. In 1866 Dr. [[Dietrich Brandis]], a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. \n \nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in [[Germany]] and [[France]], and from 1885 to 1905 at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[London]], which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University of Edinburgh]] undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers.\n \nFrom 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] (FRI) at [[Dehradun]] (established in 1906). Later The [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Indian Forest College]] (IFC) was established in 1938 at [[Dehradun]], and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. [[Forestry]], which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \"provincial list\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued.\n \nThe modern Indian Forest Service (IFS) was established in 1966, after independence, under the ''All India Services Act 1951'', for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources.\n \nIndia has an area of 635,400&nbsp;km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the [[Concurrent List]].\n\nRanks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, [[Divisional Forest Officer]] (DFOs), \n[[Deputy Conservator of Forests]],\n[[Conservator of Forests]] (CFs),\nChief Conservator of Forests (CCFs),\nAdditional [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (Addl.PCCFs),\n[[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State,\n[[Director General of Forests (India)]] - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states.\n\nThe training at [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] is designed in such a way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the [[ISRO]]'s [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]], [[University of Twente]]/[[ITC Enschede|ITC]] [[Netherlands]] and in Wildlife Management from the [[Wildlife Institute of India]]. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], SAARC Forestry Centre, [[Forest Survey of India]], [[Wildlife Institute of India]], [[Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education]] (ICFRE), [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, [[Wildlife Crime Control Bureau]] (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\n===Indian Police Service (IPS)===\n{{main|Indian Police Service}}\n\nThe Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after [[India]] gained [[Partition of India|independence]] from [[British Raj|Britain]], the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work.\n\nAn IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as its Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers.\n\nThe IPS officer takes charge as an [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]] of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as [[Superintendent of Police]] or [[Deputy commissioner of police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]] and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12-14 years, then as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] or [[Additional Commissioner of Police]] in 15 years, an [[Inspector General of Police]] in 18 years, [[Additional Director General of Police]] in 25 years and finally, the [[Director General of Police]] after 30 years in service.\n\nIPS officers also work in national government agencies such as [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Research and Analysis Wing]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] and the [[Central Industrial Security Force]], etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], [[Consul General]], Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, [[High Commissioner]] and [[Ambassador]].\n\nThe [[Director General of Police]] and [[Commissioner of Police]] is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]]  etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The [[Inspector General#India|Inspector General]] or [[Joint Commissioner of Police]] is at the head of certain specialised police force like [[Criminal Investigation Department]], Special Branch, etc.\n\n==Reforms and changes==\nIn January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| title= Retire non-performing bureaucrats: Centre to states| date= 1 July 2012| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120701135717/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| archivedate= 1 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS lazy retire\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lazy-and-incompetent-babus-to-retire-early/1/162137.html |title=Lazy and incompetent babus to retire early|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"corruption compulsory retirement\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/graft-taint-may-lead-to-retirement-for-babus/1/179684.html |title=Corruption taint may lead to compulsory retirement for babus|author=|date=21 April 2012 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS retire 15 incompetence\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/proposal-to-retire-incompetent-officers-after-15-year-service/20111130.htm |title=Proposal to retire incompetent officers after 15-year service|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Rediff News |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn recommendation by [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-ias-462676| title=Exams for state civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-IAS/articleshow/27861653.cms| title=State civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\nExpected Reforms:\n1) Creation of Indian Medical Service for Doctors\n2) All India Judicial Service- to attract best law talent into the higher judiciary\n3) Indian Education Service- to increase the quality of policy making at Central level\n\n==Disputes in using acronym IFS==\nIndian Forest Service (IFS) is the oldest service and as per the old British records acronym was used to specify the Imperial Forest Service officers. But when the Indian Foreign Service was created (1946) the acronym IFS was also used to address officers belonging to Foreign Service. Strong protests and arguments were raised by the officers of the Indian Forest Service Officers for the wrong and unhealthy practice of addressing the Indian Forest Officers as IFoS  by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). As per their version if they want to change the acronym change the Indian Foreign Service as IFoS or Indian Diplomatic Service to avoid confusion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil Services of India]]\n*[[Special Duty Allowance (SDA)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091220111744/http://www.upsc.gov.in/ais/index.htm All India Services official website]\n* [http://upsc.gov.in/ Union Public Service Commission official website]\n* [http://persmin.nic.in/ Indian Administrative Service official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619060945/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=346 Indian Police Service official website]\n* [http://ifs.nic.in/ Indian Forest Service official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174347/http://persmin.nic.in/ersheet/StartQryERS.asp List of IAS Officers]\n[[Category:All India Services| ]]\n", "name_user": "Vaidik Mart", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Services"}
