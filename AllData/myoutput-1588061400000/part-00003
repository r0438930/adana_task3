In the first phase, it is needed to achieve workers' power through representation by a coalition led by the CPRF. Achieving this goal will help eliminate the devastation from the standpoint of the party, the consequences conducted in the past decade of reforms, in particular by the nationalization of property privatized in the 1990s. However, in this case small producers will remain and moreover will be organized to protect them from robbery by \"big business, bureaucrats, and mafia groups\". It is planned to reform the management of enterprises through the creation of [[Workers' council|councils]] at various levels. The party also plans to transform Russia into a [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet republic]].{{citation needed | date = December 2017}} In the second stage, the role of councils and [[trade union]]s will increase even more. The economy will be made a gradual transition to a socialist form of [[Economics|economic activity]], but a small private equity is still retained. Finally, the third phase is to build [[socialism]].\n\nIn recent years, the Communist Party has also shown tendency of moving towards [[Dengism]]. The First Secretary Gennady Zyuganov also expressed that they should learn from China's successful example and build Russian socialism. He also encouraged all party members to read \"Selective work of Deng Xiaoping\". He said during his visit to China in 2008: \"If we have been learning the successful experience from the Chinese earlier, the Soviet Union would not have dissolved\".<ref name=\"ce.cn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ce.cn/culture/rw/wg/xw/200801/26/t20080126_14371297.shtml|title=\u4e45\u52a0\u8bfa\u592b:\u4fc4\u5171\u515a\u5458\u5e94\u597d\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u300a\u9093\u5c0f\u5e73\u6587\u9009\u300b(\u56fe)_\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7f51\u2014\u2014\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u95e8\u6237|work=ce.cn|access-date=2014-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201701/http://www.ce.cn/culture/rw/wg/xw/200801/26/t20080126_14371297.shtml|archive-date=2015-09-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2008-01-30/102214861843.shtml|title=\u4fc4\u5171\u4e3b\u5e2d\u8bbf\u534e\u81ea\u79f0\u53ea\u6c42\u516c\u5e73\u4e00\u6218|work=sina.com.cn}}</ref>\n\n=== Party program ===\nUnder the present conditions in the Russian Federation, the CPRF calls for the following proposals:<ref name=\"kprf.ru\"/>\n* Stop the extinction of the country, restore benefits for large families, reconstruct the network of public kindergartens and provide housing for young families.[[File:Moscow rally 1 May 2012 19.JPG|thumb|Communist protesters with the sign \"the order of dismissal of [[Vladimir Putin]] for the betrayal of the national interests\", Moscow, 1 May 2012]]\n* Nationalize natural resources in Russia and the strategic sectors of the economy; revenues in these industries are to be used in the interests of all citizens.\n* Return to Russia from foreign banks the state financial reserves and use them for economic and social development.\n* Break the system of total fraud in the elections.\n* Create a truly independent judiciary.\n* Carry out an immediate package of measures to combat poverty and introduce price controls on essential goods.\n* Not raise the retirement age.\n* Restore government responsibility for housing and utilities, establish fees for municipal services in an amount not more than 10% of family income, stop the eviction of people to the streets and expand public housing.\n* Increase funding for science and scientists to provide decent wages and all the necessary research.\n* Restore the highest standards of universal and free secondary and higher education that existed during the Soviet era.\n* Ensure the availability and quality of health care.\n* Vigorously develop high-tech manufacturing.\n* Ensure the food and environmental security of the country and support the large collective farms for the production and processing of agricultural products.\n* Prioritize [[domestic debt]] over [[foreign debt]] (to compensate for household deposits, burnt in the disastrous years of \"reform\").{{clarify|date=December 2015}}<!-- Which reform?

In the first phase, it is needed to achieve workers' power through representation by a coalition led by the CPRF. Achieving this goal will help eliminate the devastation from the standpoint of the party, the consequences conducted in the past decade of reforms, in particular by the nationalization of property privatized in the 1990s. However, in this case small producers will remain and moreover will be organized to protect them from robbery by \"big business, bureaucrats, and mafia groups\". It is planned to reform the management of enterprises through the creation of [[Workers' council|councils]] at various levels. The party also plans to transform Russia into a [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet republic]].{{citation needed | date = December 2017}} In the second stage, the role of councils and [[trade union]]s will increase even more. The economy will be made a gradual transition to a socialist form of [[Economics|economic activity]], but a small private equity is still retained. Finally, the third phase is to build [[socialism]].\n\nIn recent years, the Communist Party has also shown tendency of moving towards [[Dengism]]. The First Secretary Gennady Zyuganov also expressed that they should learn from China's successful example and build Russian socialism. He also encouraged all party members to read \"Selective work of Deng Xiaoping\". He said during his visit to China in 2008: \"If we have been learning the successful experience from the Chinese earlier, the Soviet Union would not have dissolved\".<ref name=\"ce.cn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ce.cn/culture/rw/wg/xw/200801/26/t20080126_14371297.shtml|title=\u4e45\u52a0\u8bfa\u592b:\u4fc4\u5171\u515a\u5458\u5e94\u597d\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u300a\u9093\u5c0f\u5e73\u6587\u9009\u300b(\u56fe)_\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7f51\u2014\u2014\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u95e8\u6237|work=ce.cn|access-date=2014-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201701/http://www.ce.cn/culture/rw/wg/xw/200801/26/t20080126_14371297.shtml|archive-date=2015-09-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2008-01-30/102214861843.shtml|title=\u4fc4\u5171\u4e3b\u5e2d\u8bbf\u534e\u81ea\u79f0\u53ea\u6c42\u516c\u5e73\u4e00\u6218|work=sina.com.cn}}</ref>\n\n=== Party program ===\nUnder the present conditions in the Russian Federation, the CPRF calls for the following proposals:<ref name=\"kprf.ru\"/>\n* Stop the extinction of the country, restore benefits for large families, reconstruct the network of public kindergartens and provide housing for young families.[[File:Moscow rally 1 May 2012 19.JPG|thumb|Communist protesters with the sign \"the order of dismissal of [[Vladimir Putin]] for the betrayal of the national interests\", Moscow, 1 May 2012]]\n* Nationalize natural resources in Russia and the strategic sectors of the economy; revenues in these industries are to be used in the interests of all citizens.\n* Return to Russia from foreign banks the state financial reserves and use them for economic and social development.\n* Break the system of total fraud in the elections.\n* Create a truly independent judiciary.\n* Carry out an immediate package of measures to combat poverty and introduce price controls on essential goods.\n* Not raise the retirement age.\n* Restore government responsibility for housing and utilities, establish fees for municipal services in an amount not more than 10% of family income, stop the eviction of people to the streets and expand public housing.\n* Increase funding for science and scientists to provide decent wages and all the necessary research.\n* Restore the highest standards of universal and free secondary and higher education that existed during the Soviet era.\n* Ensure the availability and quality of health care.\n* Vigorously develop high-tech manufacturing.\n* Ensure the food and environmental security of the country and support the large collective farms for the production and processing of agricultural products.\n* Prioritize [[domestic debt]] over [[foreign debt]] (to compensate for household deposits, burnt in the disastrous years of \"reform\").{{clarify|date=December 2015}}<!-- Which reform?
