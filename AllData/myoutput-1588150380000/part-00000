According to the ''Chronicles of Ayutthaya'', [[Sanpet III|King Ekathotsarot]] (r. 1605\u20131610) had been \"concerned solely with ways of enriching his treasury,\" and was \"greatly inclined toward strangers and foreign nations,\" especially [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and the [[Philippines]].\n\nAyutthaya was under almost constant [[Burmese\u2013Siamese wars|Burmese threat]] from the 16th century onward, and the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] was alarmed by Burmese military might. From 1766-1769, the Qianlong Emperor sent his armies four times to subdue the [[Myanmar|Burmese]], but the [[Sino-Burmese War]]s ended in complete failure and Ayutthaya fell in the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)]]. However, the Chinese efforts did divert the attention of Burma's Siam army. General [[Taksin]], himself the son of a Chinese immigrant, took advantage of this to organize his force and attack the Burmese invaders. When he became king, Taksin actively encouraged Chinese immigration and trade. Settlers mainly from [[Chaozhou]] prefecture came to Siam in large numbers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blood Brothers: The Criminal Underworld of Asia|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|isbn=1-4039-6154-9|page=234|author-link=Bertil Lintner|year=2003}}</ref> Immigration continued over the following years, and the Chinese population in Thailand jumped from 230,000 in 1825 to 792,000 by 1910.

Therefore, it became common for male Chinese immigrants to marry local Thai women. The children of such relationships were called ''Sino-Thai''<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Thailand|author=Smith Nieminen Win|isbn=0-8108-5396-5|page=231|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2005|edition=2nd}}</ref> or ''luk-jin'' (\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e08\u0e35\u0e19) in Thai.<ref>{{cite book|title=In the Place of Origins: Modernity and Its Mediums in Northern Thailand|author= Rosalind C.

If successful, they sent money back to their families in China. Many Chinese immigrants prospered under the \"[[tax farming]]\" system, whereby private individuals were sold the right to collect taxes at a price below the value of the tax revenues.\n\nIn the late 19th century, when Thailand was struggling to defend its independence from the colonial powers, Chinese bandits from Yunnan Province began making raids into the country in the [[Haw Wars]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e0f\u0e2e\u0e48\u0e2d}}). Thai nationalist attitudes at all levels were thus colored by anti-Chinese sentiment. Members of the Chinese community had long dominated domestic commerce and had served as agents for royal trade monopolies. With the rise of European economic influence, however, many Chinese shifted to opium trafficking and tax collecting, both of which were despised occupations.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1917, nearly 13,000 to 34,000 Chinese entered the country per year from [[southern China]] which was vulnerable to [[flood]]s and [[drought]], mostly settling in [[Bangkok]] and along the coast of the [[Gulf of Siam]]. They predominated in occupations requiring arduous labor, skills, or entrepreneurship. They worked as blacksmiths, railroad laborers and [[rickshaw]] pullers. While most Thais were engaged in rice production, the Chinese brought new farming ideas and new methods to supply labor on its rubber plantations,  both domestically and internationally.<ref name=\"Sowell-1997\"/>{{RP|182-184}} However, [[republicanism|republican]] ideas brought by the Chinese were considered seditious by the Thai government. For example, a translation of Chinese revolutionary [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'' was banned under the Communism Act of 1933. The government had regulated [[Chinese school]]s even before [[compulsory education]] was established in the country, starting with the Private Schools Act of 1918. This act required all foreign teachers to pass a [[Thai language]] test and for principals of all schools to implement standards set by the Thai [[Ministry of Education (Thailand)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"W\">{{cite news|title=Contending for a Claim on Civilization: The Sino-Siamese Struggle to Control Overseas Chinese Education in Siam|first=Wasana|last=Wongsurawat|journal=Journal of Chinese Overseas|volume=4|number=2| date=November 2008 |pages=161\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nLegislation by King [[Vajiravudh|Rama VI (1910\u20131925)]] that required the adoption of Thai surnames was largely directed at the Chinese community as a number of ethnic Chinese families left [[Burma]] between 1930 and 1950 and settled in the [[Ratchaburi Province|Ratchaburi]] and [[Kanchanaburi Province]]s of western Thailand. A few of the ethnic Chinese families in that area had already emigrated from Burma in the 19th century.\n\nThe Chinese in Thailand also suffered discrimination between the 1930s to 1950s under the military dictatorship of Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (in spite of having part-Chinese ancestry himself),<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of South-East Asia|last=Leifer|first=Michael|year=1996|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-13821-3|page=204}}</ref> which allied itself with the [[Empire of Japan]].

The present Thai royal family, the [[Chakri dynasty]], was founded by King [[Rama I]] who himself was partly Chinese.

According to the ''Chronicles of Ayutthaya'', [[Sanpet III|King Ekathotsarot]] (r. 1605\u20131610) had been \"concerned solely with ways of enriching his treasury,\" and was \"greatly inclined toward strangers and foreign nations,\" especially [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and the [[Philippines]].\n\nAyutthaya was under almost constant [[Burmese\u2013Siamese wars|Burmese threat]] from the 16th century onward, and the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] was alarmed by Burmese military might. From 1766-1769, the Qianlong Emperor sent his armies four times to subdue the [[Myanmar|Burmese]], but the [[Sino-Burmese War]]s ended in complete failure and Ayutthaya fell in the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)]]. However, the Chinese efforts did divert the attention of Burma's Siam army. General [[Taksin]], himself the son of a Chinese immigrant, took advantage of this to organize his force and attack the Burmese invaders. When he became king, Taksin actively encouraged Chinese immigration and trade. Settlers mainly from [[Chaozhou]] prefecture came to Siam in large numbers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blood Brothers: The Criminal Underworld of Asia|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|isbn=1-4039-6154-9|page=234|author-link=Bertil Lintner|year=2003}}</ref> Immigration continued over the following years, and the Chinese population in Thailand jumped from 230,000 in 1825 to 792,000 by 1910.

Therefore, it became common for male Chinese immigrants to marry local Thai women. The children of such relationships were called ''Sino-Thai''<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Thailand|author=Smith Nieminen Win|isbn=0-8108-5396-5|page=231|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2005|edition=2nd}}</ref> or ''luk-jin'' (\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e08\u0e35\u0e19) in Thai.<ref>{{cite book|title=In the Place of Origins: Modernity and Its Mediums in Northern Thailand|author= Rosalind C.

If successful, they sent money back to their families in China. Many Chinese immigrants prospered under the \"[[tax farming]]\" system, whereby private individuals were sold the right to collect taxes at a price below the value of the tax revenues.\n\nIn the late 19th century, when Thailand was struggling to defend its independence from the colonial powers, Chinese bandits from Yunnan Province began making raids into the country in the [[Haw Wars]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e0f\u0e2e\u0e48\u0e2d}}). Thai nationalist attitudes at all levels were thus colored by anti-Chinese sentiment. Members of the Chinese community had long dominated domestic commerce and had served as agents for royal trade monopolies. With the rise of European economic influence, however, many Chinese shifted to opium trafficking and tax collecting, both of which were despised occupations.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1917, nearly 13,000 to 34,000 Chinese entered the country per year from [[southern China]] which was vulnerable to [[flood]]s and [[drought]], mostly settling in [[Bangkok]] and along the coast of the [[Gulf of Siam]]. They predominated in occupations requiring arduous labor, skills, or entrepreneurship. They worked as blacksmiths, railroad laborers and [[rickshaw]] pullers. While most Thais were engaged in rice production, the Chinese brought new farming ideas and new methods to supply labor on its rubber plantations,  both domestically and internationally.<ref name=\"Sowell-1997\"/>{{RP|182-184}} However, [[republicanism|republican]] ideas brought by the Chinese were considered seditious by the Thai government. For example, a translation of Chinese revolutionary [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'' was banned under the Communism Act of 1933. The government had regulated [[Chinese school]]s even before [[compulsory education]] was established in the country, starting with the Private Schools Act of 1918. This act required all foreign teachers to pass a [[Thai language]] test and for principals of all schools to implement standards set by the Thai [[Ministry of Education (Thailand)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"W\">{{cite news|title=Contending for a Claim on Civilization: The Sino-Siamese Struggle to Control Overseas Chinese Education in Siam|first=Wasana|last=Wongsurawat|journal=Journal of Chinese Overseas|volume=4|number=2| date=November 2008 |pages=161\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nLegislation by King [[Vajiravudh|Rama VI (1910\u20131925)]] that required the adoption of Thai surnames was largely directed at the Chinese community as a number of ethnic Chinese families left [[Burma]] between 1930 and 1950 and settled in the [[Ratchaburi Province|Ratchaburi]] and [[Kanchanaburi Province]]s of western Thailand. A few of the ethnic Chinese families in that area had already emigrated from Burma in the 19th century.\n\nThe Chinese in Thailand also suffered discrimination between the 1930s to 1950s under the military dictatorship of Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (in spite of having part-Chinese ancestry himself),<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of South-East Asia|last=Leifer|first=Michael|year=1996|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-13821-3|page=204}}</ref> which allied itself with the [[Empire of Japan]]. The Primary Education Act of 1932 made the [[Thai language]] the compulsory medium of education, but as a result of protests from Thai Chinese, by 1939, students were allowed two hours per week of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] instruction.<ref name=\"W\"/> State corporations took over commodities such as rice, tobacco, and petroleum and Chinese businesses found themselves subject to a range of new taxes and controls. By 1970, more than 90 percent of the Chinese born in [[Thailand]] had abandoned Chinese citizenship and were granted Thai citizenship instead.
