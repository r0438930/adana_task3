Under Hitler's rule, Germany became a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]] where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The official name of the state was '''''Deutsches Reich''''' ([[German Reich]]) until 1943 and '''''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich''''' (Greater German Reich) from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany is also known as the '''Third Reich''' (''Drittes Reich''), meaning \"Third Realm\" or \"Third Empire\", alluding to the Nazis' perception that Nazi Germany was the successor of the earlier [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] (800\u20131806) and [[German Empire|German]] (1871\u20131918) empires. The Nazi regime ended after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Victory in Europe Day|defeated Germany]] in May 1945, [[End of World War II in Europe|ending World War II in Europe]].\n\nHitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]], on 30 January 1933. The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national [[1934 German referendum|referendum held 19 August 1934]] confirmed Hitler as sole ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the [[Great Depression]], the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a [[mixed economy]]. Using [[deficit spending]], the regime undertook extensive public works, including the construction of ''[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahn]]en'' (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\n\n[[Racism]], especially [[antisemitism]], was a central ideological feature of the regime. The [[Germanic peoples]] were considered by the Nazis to be the [[master race]], the purest branch of the [[Aryan race]]. Discrimination and persecution against [[Jews]] and [[Romani people]] began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned, or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that [[German resistance to Nazism|opposed Hitler's rule]] were oppressed, and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on [[scientific racism|racial biology]], population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women [[Women in Nazi Germany|were curtailed]]. Recreation and tourism were organised via the [[Strength Through Joy]] program, and the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] showcased Germany on the international stage. [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\n\nThe Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and almost all of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|a non-aggression pact]] with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, launching [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]]. By early 1941, Germany controlled much of Europe. ''[[Reichskommissariat]]s'' took control of conquered areas and a [[General Government|German administration]] was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies. ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' paramilitary [[death squad]]s inside the occupied territories conducted mass killings of millions of Jews and [[Holocaust victims|other peoples]] deemed undesirable by the state. Many others were imprisoned, [[Extermination through labour|worked to death]], or murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. This [[genocide]] is known as [[the Holocaust]].\n\nWhile the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the [[United States]] into the war meant the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the [[Axis powers]] were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of France]], Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the [[Allies of World War II|other Allies]] from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of [[denazification]] and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n== Name ==\n{{Further|Reich}}\nThe official name of the state was ''Deutsches Reich'' from 1933 to 1943 and ''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich'' from 1943 to 1945, while common English terms are \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Third Reich\". The latter, adopted by [[Nazi propaganda]] as ''Drittes Reich'', was first used in ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'', a 1923 book by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]. The book counted the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962\u20131806) as the first [[Reich]] and the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) as the second.{{sfn|Lauryssens|1999|p=102}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power}}\nGermany was known as the [[Weimar Republic]] during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a [[republic]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied victors]] of [[World War I]], and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.{{sfn|Childers|2017|pp=22\u201323, 35, 48, 124\u2013130, 152, 168\u2013169, 203\u2013204, 225\u2013226}} Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of [[World War I reparations|reparations payments]] required under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=103\u2013108}} When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied German industrial areas]] along the [[Ruhr]] and widespread civil unrest followed.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', NSDAP; Nazi Party) was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties then active in Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170\u2013171}} The NSDAP party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical [[antisemitism]], and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of [[Jews]], who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' movement]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} The party, especially its paramilitary organisation ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members (as well as Jewish people) on the streets.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=180\u2013181}} Such far-right armed groups were common in [[Bavaria]], and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=181, 189}}\n\nWhen the stock market in the United States [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed on 24 October 1929]], the effect in Germany was dire.{{sfn|Childers|2017|p=103}} Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136\u2013137}} Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest, and improving Germany's international reputation. After the [[German federal election, July 1932|federal election of 1932]], the NSDAP was the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], holding 230 seats with 37.4 percent of the popular vote.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=87}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See|History of Germany}}\n[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] became Germany's head of state, with the title of ''[[F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler]]'', in 1934.]]\n\n=== Nazi seizure of power ===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931\u20131933)}}\nAlthough the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority. Hitler therefore led a short-lived coalition government formed with the [[German National People's Party]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=293, 302}} Under pressure from politicians, industrialists, and the business community, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\").{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nOn the night of 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag building was set afire]]. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], a Dutch communist, was found guilty of starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges. The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda campaign that led to public support for the measure.

The [[Bank of France]] was forced to provide 4.5&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded Germany had obtained 104&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the [[gross domestic product]] of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=943}}\n\nNazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions.

G\u00f6ring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50&nbsp;million Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} In 1940, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.{{sfn|Manvell|2011|pp=283\u2013285}} By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=946}} In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing\u2014items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany\u2014for shipment home.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=334}}\n\nGoods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated {{convert|9000000|t|LT ST}} of [[cereal]]s were seized during the course of the war, including 75 percent of its oats. In addition, 80 percent of the country's oil and 74 percent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5&nbsp;billion [[franc]]s. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=944}}\n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered.

During the course of the German occupation, some 12&nbsp;million pigs and 13&nbsp;million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany became a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]] where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The official name of the state was '''''Deutsches Reich''''' ([[German Reich]]) until 1943 and '''''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich''''' (Greater German Reich) from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany is also known as the '''Third Reich''' (''Drittes Reich''), meaning \"Third Realm\" or \"Third Empire\", alluding to the Nazis' perception that Nazi Germany was the successor of the earlier [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] (800\u20131806) and [[German Empire|German]] (1871\u20131918) empires. The Nazi regime ended after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Victory in Europe Day|defeated Germany]] in May 1945, [[End of World War II in Europe|ending World War II in Europe]].\n\nHitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]], on 30 January 1933. The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national [[1934 German referendum|referendum held 19 August 1934]] confirmed Hitler as sole ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the [[Great Depression]], the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a [[mixed economy]]. Using [[deficit spending]], the regime undertook extensive public works, including the construction of ''[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahn]]en'' (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\n\n[[Racism]], especially [[antisemitism]], was a central ideological feature of the regime. The [[Germanic peoples]] were considered by the Nazis to be the [[master race]], the purest branch of the [[Aryan race]]. Discrimination and persecution against [[Jews]] and [[Romani people]] began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned, or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that [[German resistance to Nazism|opposed Hitler's rule]] were oppressed, and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on [[scientific racism|racial biology]], population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women [[Women in Nazi Germany|were curtailed]]. Recreation and tourism were organised via the [[Strength Through Joy]] program, and the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] showcased Germany on the international stage. [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\n\nThe Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and almost all of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|a non-aggression pact]] with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, launching [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]]. By early 1941, Germany controlled much of Europe. ''[[Reichskommissariat]]s'' took control of conquered areas and a [[General Government|German administration]] was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies. ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' paramilitary [[death squad]]s inside the occupied territories conducted mass killings of millions of Jews and [[Holocaust victims|other peoples]] deemed undesirable by the state. Many others were imprisoned, [[Extermination through labour|worked to death]], or murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. This [[genocide]] is known as [[the Holocaust]].\n\nWhile the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the [[United States]] into the war meant the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the [[Axis powers]] were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of France]], Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the [[Allies of World War II|other Allies]] from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of [[denazification]] and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n== Name ==\n{{Further|Reich}}\nThe official name of the state was ''Deutsches Reich'' from 1933 to 1943 and ''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich'' from 1943 to 1945, while common English terms are \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Third Reich\". The latter, adopted by [[Nazi propaganda]] as ''Drittes Reich'', was first used in ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'', a 1923 book by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]. The book counted the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962\u20131806) as the first [[Reich]] and the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) as the second.{{sfn|Lauryssens|1999|p=102}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power}}\nGermany was known as the [[Weimar Republic]] during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a [[republic]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied victors]] of [[World War I]], and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.{{sfn|Childers|2017|pp=22\u201323, 35, 48, 124\u2013130, 152, 168\u2013169, 203\u2013204, 225\u2013226}} Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of [[World War I reparations|reparations payments]] required under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=103\u2013108}} When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied German industrial areas]] along the [[Ruhr]] and widespread civil unrest followed.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', NSDAP; Nazi Party) was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties then active in Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170\u2013171}} The NSDAP party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical [[antisemitism]], and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of [[Jews]], who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' movement]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} The party, especially its paramilitary organisation ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members (as well as Jewish people) on the streets.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=180\u2013181}} Such far-right armed groups were common in [[Bavaria]], and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=181, 189}}\n\nWhen the stock market in the United States [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed on 24 October 1929]], the effect in Germany was dire.{{sfn|Childers|2017|p=103}} Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed.

The [[Bank of France]] was forced to provide 4.5&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded Germany had obtained 104&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the [[gross domestic product]] of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=943}}\n\nNazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions. Hitler and G\u00f6ring in particular were interested in acquiring looted art treasures from occupied Europe,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} the former planning to use the stolen art to fill the galleries of the planned ''[[F\u00fchrermuseum]]'' (Leader's Museum),{{sfn|Spotts|2002|pp=377\u2013378}} and the latter for his personal collection. G\u00f6ring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50 million Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} In 1940, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.{{sfn|Manvell|2011|pp=283\u2013285}} By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=946}} In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing\u2014items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany\u2014for shipment home.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=334}}\n\nGoods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated {{convert|9000000|t|LT ST}} of [[cereal]]s were seized during the course of the war, including 75 percent of its oats. In addition, 80 percent of the country's oil and 74 percent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5&nbsp;billion [[franc]]s. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=944}}\n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered. In 1943 alone, 9,000,000 tons of cereals, {{convert|2000000|t|LT ST}} of fodder, {{convert|3000000|t|LT ST}} of potatoes, and {{convert|662000|t|LT ST}} of meats were sent back to Germany. During the course of the German occupation, some 12 million pigs and 13&nbsp;million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks.

Outside of Germany, the Romani people were regularly used for forced labour, though many were killed. In the Baltic states and the Soviet Union, 30,000 Romani were killed by the SS, the German Army, and ''Einsatzgruppen''.
