It attempts to address the [[mind\u2013body problem]] and resists the Western traditions of [[mind\u2013body dualism]]. The term bodymind is also typically seen and encountered in [[disability studies]], referring to the intricate and often times inseparable relationship between the body and the mind, and how these two units might act as one. The field of [[psychosomatic medicine]] investigates the embodied manifestations of psychological processes.  \n\n== Dualism vs holism ==\nIn the field of philosophy, the theory of dualism is the speculation that the mental and the physical parts of us- like our minds and our bodies- are different or separate.<ref>{{Citation|last=Robinson|first=Howard|title=Dualism|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/dualism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Holism is the idea or speculation that all the properties of a system- such as the system of our thoughts, and the system of our body- cannot be determined or explained by looking at its components individually.

The first is the mind \u2013 the center of our thoughts, and the heart (or body) \u2013 which is the center of our feelings. In Western culture, there is more of a debate on whether these different parts that make us unique are sperate or connected.\n\nIn Eastern culture, especially in areas such as and surrounding India and the Middle East, the idea of body-mind is the exact opposite. The words \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cheart\u2019 both translate into \u201cchitta,\u201d which refers to the mind. \u201cChitta\u201d is one of the three overlapping terms used that refers to the mind.

Poteat (19 April, 1919 \u2013 17 May 2000). Throughout the course of his lifetime, Poteat was known for his great contributions to Post-Critical Philosophy and for being the leader of formative and influential ideas such as \u201cbodymind.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whpoteat.org/|title=whpoteat.org|website=whpoteat.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> As a man who emphasized in philosophy, it is said he identified himself as a \u201c\u201d practicing dialectician.\u201d He was known to encourage and challenge not only himself, but those around him, to question, understand, and challenge the reasoning and facts of the confusing aspects of modern life. Poteat drew his inspirations and ideas from Michael Polanyi, who wrote \u201cThe Stability of Beliefs\u201d in 1952. In this essay, Polanyi spoke about how there are two ways of holding beliefs. He stated, \u201cSome are held by the explicit profession of certain articles of faith, as the Apostles\u2019 Creed when recited in the words of the Book of Common Prayer. The other form of belief is held implicitly by reliance on a particular conceptual framework by which all experience is interpreted.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|date=1952|title=The Stability of Beliefs|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/685265|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=3|issue=11|pages=217\u2013232|issn=0007-0882}}</ref> Other influential people Poteat looked to for further inspiration were the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), a man considered to be the first existential philosopher (philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and choice), the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908\u20131961), and Hannah Arendt (1906-1975), a German-American philosopher and political theorist and many others. Together, these people and their ideas, along with Poteat\u2019s own ideas and theories, helped him further understand and share the concept and ideas of what bodymind is in today\u2019s modern world.\n\n== Bodymind and religion ==\nThe approach to bodymind is believed in and viewed through multiple faiths and practices. These include Vajrayana, Mahayana, Theravada, and Zen Buddhism. Like many religions today, these different branches of Buddhism originate from the same root and tree. They have very similar ideas and beliefs, but there are differences in the way they practice and live their beliefs. However, in each of their faiths, the concept of bodymind, otherwise known as namarupa, is key. Another similarity that all the different branches of Buddhism share is the daily practice of \u201cSila\u201d \u201cSamhdai,\u201d and \u201cPrajna.\u201d The idea and practice of Buddhism originated in India, and is now practiced throughout the world. The core teachings of Buddhism are the Three Universal Truths, The Four Noble Truths, and The Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nThe three Noble Truths are: Nothing is lost in the universe, everything changes, and the law of cause and effect. The Four Noble Truths are: suffering exists (Dukkha), there is a cause of suffering (Samudaya), there is an end to suffering (Nirodha), and in order to end suffering, you must follow the Eightfold Path (Magga). Finally, the Eightfold Path consists of the following:\n\n1) \u00a0 Right understanding of the Four Noble Truths\n\n2) \u00a0 Right thinking\n\n3) \u00a0 Right speech\n\n4) \u00a0 Right conduct or action\n\n5) \u00a0 Right livelihood\n\n6) \u00a0 Right effort\n\n7) \u00a0 Right mindfulness\n\n8) \u00a0 Right concentration\n\nBuddhism is one of the main ways in which we can view and more fully understand the bodymind approach- especially in today\u2019s modern world of many different advancements, ideas, and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/|title=UNHCR\u00a0- The UN Refugee Agency|website=www.unhcr.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Modern understanding ==\n\u201cThe mind is composed of mental fragments- sensations, feelings, thoughts, imaginations, all flowing now in an ordered sequence, now in a chaotic fashion\u2026. On the other hand, the body is constructed under the underlying laws of physics, and its components obey the well-enumerated laws of physiology. It is these characteristic differences between these two \u2013 between mind and body \u2013 that lead to the Mind-Body problem.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=John G.|date=2010-10-28|title=Mind-body problem: New approaches|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mind-body_problem:_New_approaches|journal=Scholarpedia|language=en|volume=5|issue=10|pages=1580|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1580|issn=1941-6016}}</ref>There is still no concrete evidence if the mind has more impact on who we are, or of our bodies do. While the Western population tends to believe more in the idea of dualism, there is no reason to not believe the idea of holism. Many throughout the world who try to understand and live the idea of holism, say they feel more connected with themselves, with the environment, and with those around them. If anything, bodymind shows the significance of connected everything is- both in and outside ourselves. Bodymind is brought up in many different situations today in the modern world- especially in modern and alternative medicines.\n\n==Relevance to alternative medicine==\nIn the field of [[alternative medicine]], bodymind implies that \n* The body, mind, emotions, and spirit are dynamically interrelated.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness|last = Damasio|first = Antonio|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0156010757|location = |pages = |url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/feelingofwhathap00dama_0}}</ref>\n* Experience, including physical stress, emotional injury, and pleasures are stored in the body's cells which in turn affects one's reactions to stimuli.<ref>Keleman, Stanley: ''Your Body speaks its Mind'', Center Press (US) (1989) {{ISBN|978-0934320016}} </ref>\nThe term can be   a number of disciplines, including:\n* [[Psychoneuroimmunology]], the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.<ref>{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}</ref>\n* [[Body psychotherapy]],<ref>Totton, N.

Poteat]].\n\n== Relevance to disability studies ==\nThe term bodymind is most generally used in the academic field of disability studies. Disability scholars use the term bodymind to emphasize the interdependence and inseparability of the body and mind.\n\nProminent scholars who have written academically about the bodymind include Eli Clare, Margaret Price, Sami Schalk, Alyson Patsavas, and Alison Kafer. Clare and Price have proposed that the bodymind expresses the interrelatedness of mental and physical processes, and Schalk defines the bodymind similarly as it pertains to disability and race.\n\nOne of the first scholars to popularize the concept of bodymind is Eli Clare, a writer and activist for queer and disability studies. Clare uses bodymind in his work ''Brilliant Imperfection'' as a way to resist common Western assumptions that the body and mind are separate entities, or that the mind is \u201csuperior\u201d to the body.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brilliant Imperfection: Grappling with Cure|last=Clare|first=Eli|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822362760|location=Durham|pages=xvi}}</ref> Similarly, scholar Margaret Price writes that the combination of \u2018body\u2019 and \u2018mind\u2019 in one term acknowledges that \u201cmental and physical processes not only affect each other but also give rise to each other\u2014that is, because they tend to act as one, even though they are conventionally understood as two\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Margaret|date=2014|title=The Bodymind Problem and the Possibilities of Pain|journal=Hypatia|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=268\u2013284|doi=10.1111/hypa.12127}}</ref>\n\nScholar Sami Schalk in her work ''Bodyminds Reimagined'' uses the term bodymind to recognize that \u201cprocesses within our being impact one another in such a way that the notion of a physical versus mental process is difficult, if not impossible to clearly discern in most cases\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Bodyminds Reimagined: (Dis)ability, Race, and Gender in Black Women's Speculative Fiction|last=Schalk|first=Samantha Dawn|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780822370734|location=Durham|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bodymindsreimagi00scha/page/269 269, 5]|url=https://archive.org/details/bodymindsreimagi00scha/page/269}}</ref> Schalk emphasizes the utility of the term bodymind as it relates to disability and race. In analyzing histories of race, gender, and disability, Schalk notes that it is important to recognize the non-physical impact of various oppressions. For Schalk, the term bodymind highlights the \u201cpsychic stress\u201d of oppression.<ref name=\":0\" /> In relation to [[transgenerational trauma]] in people of color, bodymind is used to show how the psychological toll of oppression and its resulting stress has lasting mental and physical manifestations.\n\nThe connection between the body and mind is not merely theoretical; for example, the interrelation between mental and physical health is explored in the field of psychosomatic medicine, which investigates bodily processes in relation to social and psychological factors. For example, the psychiatric condition [[major depressive disorder]] often manifests physically in the forms of excessive sleeping, loss of appetite, weight gain or loss, back pain, and headaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007|title=Depression (major depressive disorder) - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Disability]]\n* [[Disability studies|Disability Studies]]\n* [[Ableism]]\n* [[Developmental disability|Developmental Disability]]\n* [[Emotional or behavioral disability]]\n* [[Invisible disability]]\n* [[Inclusion (disability rights)]]\n* [[List of disability studies journals]]\n* [[Social model of disability]]\n* [[Medical model of disability]]\n* [[Society for Disability Studies]]\n* [[Disability rights movement|Disability rights]]\n* [[Services and supports for people with disabilities|Services for the disabled]]\n* [[Disability and religion]]\n* [[Sexuality and disability]]\n* [[Disability culture]]\n* [[Disability in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Benson MD, Herbert; ( 2000) (1975), '' The Relaxation Response'', Harper  {{ISBN|0-380-81595-8}}\n* Bracken, Patrick & Philip Thomas; (2002), [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/325/7378/1433 ''\"Time to move beyond the mind-body split\"''], editorial, [[British Medical Journal]] 2002;325:1433-1434 (21 December)\n* Dychtwald, Ken; (1986),  ''Bodymind''  Penguin Putman Inc.

The Four Noble Truths are: suffering exists (Dukkha), there is a cause of suffering (Samudaya), there is an end to suffering (Nirodha), and in order to end suffering, you must follow the Eightfold Path (Magga). Finally, the Eightfold Path consists of the following:\n\n1) \u00a0 Right understanding of the Four Noble Truths\n\n2) \u00a0 Right thinking\n\n3) \u00a0 Right speech\n\n4) \u00a0 Right conduct or action\n\n5) \u00a0 Right livelihood\n\n6) \u00a0 Right effort\n\n7) \u00a0 Right mindfulness\n\n8) \u00a0 Right concentration\n\nBuddhism is one of the main ways in which we can view and more fully understand the bodymind approach- especially in today\u2019s modern world of many different advancements, ideas, and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/|title=UNHCR\u00a0- The UN Refugee Agency|website=www.unhcr.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Modern understanding ==\n\u201cThe mind is composed of mental fragments- sensations, feelings, thoughts, imaginations, all flowing now in an ordered sequence, now in a chaotic fashion\u2026. On the other hand, the body is constructed under the underlying laws of physics, and its components obey the well-enumerated laws of physiology. It is these characteristic differences between these two \u2013 between mind and body \u2013 that lead to the Mind-Body problem.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=John G.|date=2010-10-28|title=Mind-body problem: New approaches|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mind-body_problem:_New_approaches|journal=Scholarpedia|language=en|volume=5|issue=10|pages=1580|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1580|issn=1941-6016}}</ref>There is still no concrete evidence if the mind has more impact on who we are, or of our bodies do. While the Western population tends to believe more in the idea of dualism, there is no reason to not believe the idea of holism. Many throughout the world who try to understand and live the idea of holism, say they feel more connected with themselves, with the environment, and with those around them. If anything, bodymind shows the significance of connected everything is- both in and outside ourselves. Bodymind is brought up in many different situations today in the modern world- especially in modern and alternative medicines.\n\n==Relevance to alternative medicine==\nIn the field of [[alternative medicine]], bodymind implies that \n* The body, mind, emotions, and spirit are dynamically interrelated.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness|last = Damasio|first = Antonio|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0156010757|location = |pages = |url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/feelingofwhathap00dama_0}}</ref>\n* Experience, including physical stress, emotional injury, and pleasures are stored in the body's cells which in turn affects one's reactions to stimuli.<ref>Keleman, Stanley: ''Your Body speaks its Mind'', Center Press (US) (1989) {{ISBN|978-0934320016}} </ref>\nThe term can be   a number of disciplines, including:\n* [[Psychoneuroimmunology]], the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.<ref>{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}</ref>\n* [[Body psychotherapy]],<ref>Totton, N.

Poteat]].\n\n== Relevance to disability studies ==\nThe term bodymind is most generally used in the academic field of disability studies. Disability scholars use the term bodymind to emphasize the interdependence and inseparability of the body and mind.\n\nProminent scholars who have written academically about the bodymind include Eli Clare, Margaret Price, Sami Schalk, Alyson Patsavas, and Alison Kafer. Clare and Price have proposed that the bodymind expresses the interrelatedness of mental and physical processes, and Schalk defines the bodymind similarly as it pertains to disability and race.\n\nOne of the first scholars to popularize the concept of bodymind is Eli Clare, a writer and activist for queer and disability studies. Clare uses bodymind in his work ''Brilliant Imperfection'' as a way to resist common Western assumptions that the body and mind are separate entities, or that the mind is \u201csuperior\u201d to the body.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brilliant Imperfection: Grappling with Cure|last=Clare|first=Eli|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822362760|location=Durham|pages=xvi}}</ref> Similarly, scholar Margaret Price writes that the combination of \u2018body\u2019 and \u2018mind\u2019 in one term acknowledges that \u201cmental and physical processes not only affect each other but also give rise to each other\u2014that is, because they tend to act as one, even though they are conventionally understood as two\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Margaret|date=2014|title=The Bodymind Problem and the Possibilities of Pain|journal=Hypatia|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=268\u2013284|doi=10.1111/hypa.12127}}</ref>\n\nScholar Sami Schalk in her work ''Bodyminds Reimagined'' uses the term bodymind to recognize that \u201cprocesses within our being impact one another in such a way that the notion of a physical versus mental process is difficult, if not impossible to clearly discern in most cases\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Bodyminds Reimagined: (Dis)ability, Race, and Gender in Black Women's Speculative Fiction|last=Schalk|first=Samantha Dawn|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780822370734|location=Durham|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bodymindsreimagi00scha/page/269 269, 5]|url=https://archive.org/details/bodymindsreimagi00scha/page/269}}</ref> Schalk emphasizes the utility of the term bodymind as it relates to disability and race. In analyzing histories of race, gender, and disability, Schalk notes that it is important to recognize the non-physical impact of various oppressions. For Schalk, the term bodymind highlights the \u201cpsychic stress\u201d of oppression.<ref name=\":0\" /> In relation to [[transgenerational trauma]] in people of color, bodymind is used to show how the psychological toll of oppression and its resulting stress has lasting mental and physical manifestations.\n\nThe connection between the body and mind is not merely theoretical; for example, the interrelation between mental and physical health is explored in the field of psychosomatic medicine, which investigates bodily processes in relation to social and psychological factors. For example, the psychiatric condition [[major depressive disorder]] often manifests physically in the forms of excessive sleeping, loss of appetite, weight gain or loss, back pain, and headaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007|title=Depression (major depressive disorder) - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Disability]]\n* [[Disability studies|Disability Studies]]\n* [[Ableism]]\n* [[Developmental disability|Developmental Disability]]\n* [[Emotional or behavioral disability]]\n* [[Invisible disability]]\n* [[Inclusion (disability rights)]]\n* [[List of disability studies journals]]\n* [[Social model of disability]]\n* [[Medical model of disability]]\n* [[Society for Disability Studies]]\n* [[Disability rights movement|Disability rights]]\n* [[Services and supports for people with disabilities|Services for the disabled]]\n* [[Disability and religion]]\n* [[Sexuality and disability]]\n* [[Disability culture]]\n* [[Disability in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Benson MD, Herbert; ( 2000) (1975), '' The Relaxation Response'', Harper  {{ISBN|0-380-81595-8}}\n* Bracken, Patrick & Philip Thomas; (2002), [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/325/7378/1433 ''\"Time to move beyond the mind-body split\"''], editorial, [[British Medical Journal]] 2002;325:1433-1434 (21 December)\n* Dychtwald, Ken; (1986),  ''Bodymind''  Penguin Putman Inc.
