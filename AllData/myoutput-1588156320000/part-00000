In 2007, the agreement between TNA and the NWA ended, leading to the creation of the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.  The championship was unveiled on May 14, 2007 at the taping of TNA's primary television program, ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'', which aired on May 17, 2007.<ref name=\"PWTorchImpact0517\"/> The inaugural champion was [[Kurt Angle]], who also holds the record for the most reigns at six.\n\nWhen TNA changed its name and became Impact Wrestling in March 2017, the title was renamed soon after to reflect the change. After Impact Wrestling rebranded to GFW later that year, the title was [[Championship unification|unified]] with the [[GFW Global Championship (2014\u20132017)|original GFW Global Championship]] at [[Slammiversary XV]] and became the Unified GFW World Heavyweight Championship. Following [[Destination X (2017)|Destination X]], the title took the GFW Global Championship name and kept the former TNA lineage. On October 23, 2017, the GFW name was dropped and the company name was reverted to Impact Wrestling when the company severed ties with Jeff Jarrett and he took the GFW name with him. However, Impact Wrestling kept the Global Championship name for their championship and the title was then called the Impact Global Championship. As of the February 1, 2018 episode of ''Impact!'', the title has been known as the Impact World Championship. On June 4, 2018, the title was unified with the [[Impact Grand Championship]].\n\n== History ==\nImpact Wrestling was formed as NWA: Total Nonstop Action in May 2002.<ref name=\"Yearone\">{{cite video|people=[[Total Nonstop Action]]|title=TNA Wrestling: Year One|publisher=[[TNA Home Video]]}}</ref> Later that same year, TNA was granted control over the NWA World Heavyweight and [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championships]] by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) governing body;

In September 2017, GFW reverted their branding to Impact Wrestling.\n\n== Championship belt design ==\nDuring the championship's history it has had five designs, with the original title belt (which was unveiled in May 2007) having on its center plate an imprint of an eagle with its wings extended. The word \"World\" was placed above the eagle's head on a ribbon. The ribbon was wrapped around the bird's wings and body. Five stars were engraved on the ribbon when it passed over each of the bird's wings and the word \"Champion\" as it passed over the bird's talons. The words \"Heavyweight Wrestling\" were printed across the bird's chest. At the top of the center plate there was TNA logo. Four smaller side plates had an imprint of a globe centered with TNA's logo at the top and bottom of each.

At [[Destination X (2017)|Destination X 2017]], the GFW Global Championship belt, with an updated color scheme and ''Impact'' logos on the side plates, became the sole belt used. Following departure of Jeff Jarrett from the promotion, the company reverted to the Impact Wrestling name and the title belt was updated with Impact plate to reflect the change.\n\nA new title design was announced and introduced at Impact Wrestling's [[Impact Wrestling Redemption|Redemption]] on April 22, 2018. The gold center plate has the Impact logo with an owl design on top of it and \"World Champion\" inscribed below the logo. On each side of the center plate is a group of four smaller gold plates, with the first two on each side featuring separate corresponding halves of a globe with \"World\" inscribed above the globes and \"Champion\" inscribed below them and the second pair featuring the Impact logo without an owl design. In 2020 a modified version of this belt was introduced, with red shading replacing the previous blue, to reflect the new TV home of Impact, the Anthem owned [[AXS TV]].\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Main|List of Impact World Champions}}\nOverall, there have been 48 reigns shared among 27 wrestlers. The inaugural champion was Kurt Angle, who won the championship by defeating Christian Cage and Sting in a three match on May 13, 2007, at TNA's Sacrifice event. Angle's first reign also holds the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at 1 day. Angle also holds the record for the most reigns, at six.<ref name=\"titlehistory2008\"/> At {{age in days|month1=10|day1=26|year1=2011|month2=07|day2=08|year2=2012}} days, [[Bobby Roode]]'s first reign is the longest in the title's history. The title has been vacated five different times.\n\n[[Tessa Blanchard]] is the current champion in her first reign. She won the title by defeating [[Sami Callihan]], in an [[Intergender wrestling|intergender match]] at [[Impact Wrestling Hard To Kill]] on January 12, 2020.

In 2007, the agreement between TNA and the NWA ended, leading to the creation of the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.  The championship was unveiled on May 14, 2007 at the taping of TNA's primary television program, ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'', which aired on May 17, 2007.<ref name=\"PWTorchImpact0517\"/> The inaugural champion was [[Kurt Angle]], who also holds the record for the most reigns at six.\n\nWhen TNA changed its name and became Impact Wrestling in March 2017, the title was renamed soon after to reflect the change. After Impact Wrestling rebranded to GFW later that year, the title was [[Championship unification|unified]] with the [[GFW Global Championship (2014\u20132017)|original GFW Global Championship]] at [[Slammiversary XV]] and became the Unified GFW World Heavyweight Championship. Following [[Destination X (2017)|Destination X]], the title took the GFW Global Championship name and kept the former TNA lineage. On October 23, 2017, the GFW name was dropped and the company name was reverted to Impact Wrestling when the company severed ties with Jeff Jarrett and he took the GFW name with him. However, Impact Wrestling kept the Global Championship name for their championship and the title was then called the Impact Global Championship. As of the February 1, 2018 episode of ''Impact!'', the title has been known as the Impact World Championship. On June 4, 2018, the title was unified with the [[Impact Grand Championship]].\n\n== History ==\nImpact Wrestling was formed as NWA: Total Nonstop Action in May 2002.<ref name=\"Yearone\">{{cite video|people=[[Total Nonstop Action]]|title=TNA Wrestling: Year One|publisher=[[TNA Home Video]]}}</ref> Later that same year, TNA was granted control over the NWA World Heavyweight and [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championships]] by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) governing body;

In September 2017, GFW reverted their branding to Impact Wrestling.\n\n== Championship belt design ==\nDuring the championship's history it has had five designs, with the original title belt (which was unveiled in May 2007) having on its center plate an imprint of an eagle with its wings extended. The word \"World\" was placed above the eagle's head on a ribbon. The ribbon was wrapped around the bird's wings and body. Five stars were engraved on the ribbon when it passed over each of the bird's wings and the word \"Champion\" as it passed over the bird's talons. The words \"Heavyweight Wrestling\" were printed across the bird's chest. At the top of the center plate there was TNA logo. Four smaller side plates had an imprint of a globe centered with TNA's logo at the top and bottom of each. At each end of the title belt there was a small plate that covered the championship belt snaps with TNA's logo engraved on each.{{ref|1}}\n\n[[File:NewJeffHardy1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Jeff Hardy]] with the second title belt design, dubbed the \"Immortal Championship\"]]\n\nAt the November 8, 2010 tapings of the November 11 episode of ''Impact!'', TNA introduced a new design for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt, which the champion [[Jeff Hardy]] dubbed the \"Immortal Championship\", as part of the [[Immortal (professional wrestling)|Immortal]] storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_45151.shtml|title=TNA News: Impact TV taping spoiler - TNA to introduce new title belt on Thursday's Impact (w/pic)|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-11-08|accessdate=2010-11-09|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> The new design consisted of a purple strap with a silver center plate depicting a masked head (designed to resemble Hardy's face with face paint), the TNA logo on the forehead and blue lines along the mask.

At [[Destination X (2017)|Destination X 2017]], the GFW Global Championship belt, with an updated color scheme and ''Impact'' logos on the side plates, became the sole belt used. Following departure of Jeff Jarrett from the promotion, the company reverted to the Impact Wrestling name and the title belt was updated with Impact plate to reflect the change.\n\nA new title design was announced and introduced at Impact Wrestling's [[Impact Wrestling Redemption|Redemption]] on April 22, 2018. The gold center plate has the Impact logo with an owl design on top of it and \"World Champion\" inscribed below the logo. On each side of the center plate is a group of four smaller gold plates, with the first two on each side featuring separate corresponding halves of a globe with \"World\" inscribed above the globes and \"Champion\" inscribed below them and the second pair featuring the Impact logo without an owl design. In 2020 a modified version of this belt was introduced, with red shading replacing the previous blue, to reflect the new TV home of Impact, the Anthem owned [[AXS TV]].\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Main|List of Impact World Champions}}\nOverall, there have been 48 reigns shared among 27 wrestlers. The inaugural champion was Kurt Angle, who won the championship by defeating Christian Cage and Sting in a three match on May 13, 2007, at TNA's Sacrifice event. Angle's first reign also holds the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at 1 day. Angle also holds the record for the most reigns, at six.<ref name=\"titlehistory2008\"/> At {{age in days|month1=10|day1=26|year1=2011|month2=07|day2=08|year2=2012}} days, [[Bobby Roode]]'s first reign is the longest in the title's history. The title has been vacated five different times.\n\n[[Tessa Blanchard]] is the current champion in her first reign. She won the title by defeating [[Sami Callihan]], in an [[Intergender wrestling|intergender match]] at [[Impact Wrestling Hard To Kill]] on January 12, 2020.
