It is located in Leiden, Netherlands. LUMC is a modern university medical center for research, education and patient care. Its research practice ranges from pure fundamental medical research to applied clinical research.\n\n== Patient care ==\nThe hospital has clinical departments of all [[medicine|medical]] specialties, and acts as a tertiary referral centre for the northern part of the province of [[South Holland]]. Special units include:\n* Ophthalmology\n* Neurosurgery\n* Cardiothoracic surgery\n* Neonatal and pediatric surgery and intensive care\n* Pediatric oncology\n* Orthopedic medicine\n* Biliary surgery\n* Rheumatology\n* [[Level I trauma center]]\n\n== Research ==\nThe LUMC aims at identifying the causes of disease, improving diagnosis, prevention, and ultimately developing effective treatments. Within LUMC different specialists work together around research themes. Combining cross-border expertise may solve biomedical problems and bring answers not found when working in a stand-alone fashion. The themes are:\n* Vascular and Regenerative medicine\n* Immunity, Infection and Tolerance\n* Translational Neuroscience\n* Cancer Pathogenesis and Therapy\n* Ageing\n* Innovation in Health Strategy and Quality of Care\n* Biomedical Imaging\n\n== Education ==\nLUMC offers a large range of education and hosts the Faculty of Medicine of Leiden University. Education is seen as a joint responsibility of students and professors and a critical scientific attitude and curiosity are valued highly. Enjoying studies and student life is also considered to be important. LUMC offers the following university courses:\n* Bachelor and master in Medicine\n* Bachelor and master in Biomedical Sciences \n* Bachelor in Clinical Technology (joined programme with TU Delft and Erasmus MC)\n* Master in Vitality and Ageing. \n* Master in Pharmacy\n* Electives and exchange options for international students\nLUMC also offers continuing education and training for doctors, scientists and other healthcare professionals. Continuing education is organized by the departments Boerhaave Nascholing and Educatie Zorgsector.\n\n== History of LUMC ==\n[[File:ErfgoedLeiden LEI001013922 Academische ziekenhuis.jpeg|thumb|The university hospital in the Steenstraat, Leiden, in the 19th century.]]\nIn the very first teaching hospital in the Caeciliagasthuis in Leiden (now the Boerhaave Museum) professors gave bedside lectures \u2013 for example, Herman Boerhaave, in the 18th century. Several times, patients and professors moved to larger and better furnished premises and in 1873 the first university hospital to be built as such opened its doors on Steenstraat (it now houses the National Museum for Ethnology).\n\nAt the time, the building did justice to nursing practices and operation techniques, but after a few decades it was already obsolete. More laboratory space was needed, and safer and more comfortable conditions for patients and staff alike. The new hospital on Rijnsburgerweg, built in the early 1920s on the basis of the pavilion system, made way in the 1980s and 1990s for the present Building 1 of the LUMC.\n\nMedicine has changed and developed beyond recognition over the centuries. After World War II, fundamental research became an increasingly important task of Leiden University\u2019s Faculty of Medicine. The Biomedical Science study programme is an expression of this. In patient care, high technology treatments have come in the place of admissions lasting weeks or months.\n\nThe many years of collaboration between the university and the teaching hospital acquired greater permanence in 1996 when the hospital and medical faculty merged to form Leiden University Medical Center, with patient care, instruction, study programmes, continuing education and research as its five core tasks.\n\nThe opening of two new buildings on 1 December 2006 was the fulfilment of a wish of long standing: all the core tasks are now under one roof. The various buildings are linked by skyways and tunnels, thus symbolising the interrelationship of the core tasks.\n\nIn 2016 [[Leiden University Medical Centre]] founded a branch at [[Campus The Hague]], with research, teaching and a training programme for [[General practitioner|GPs]].<ref>Leiden University newsrelease: [https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2016/03/start-of-lumc-campus-the-hague Start of LUMC Campus The Hague], 18 March 2016</ref>\n\n==PREVENT-nCoV consortium==\n\nLeiden University Medical Center is part of the PREVENT-nCoV consortium comprising [[ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies]], AdaptVac (a joint-venture between ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies and the [[University of Copenhagen]] spin-out NextGen Vaccines), the [[Institute for Tropical Medicine T\u00fcbingen]], The Department of Immunology and Microbiology (ISIM) at the University of Copenhagen, and the Laboratory of Virology at [[Wageningen University and Research]].<ref>{{cite web |title=ExpreS2ion announces selection of AGC Biologics as manufacturing partner for the COVID-19 vaccine and provides update to the program |url=https://news.cision.com/expres2ion-biotechnologies/r/expres2ion-announces-selection-of-agc-biologics-as-manufacturing-partner-for-the-covid-19-vaccine-an,c3094798 |website=[[Cision]] |accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref> In March 2020 the consortium was awarded an EU [[Horizon 2020]] grant of \u20ac2.7million for the development of a [[COVID-19 vaccine]] candidate.<ref>{{cite web |title=PREVENT-nCoV consortium announces EU grant award for COVID-19 vaccine development programme |url=https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/files/view/W0nPpDMa6lLgzbJo9VGLXAbO/200309%20Press%20release%20Covid-19%20consortium_final.pdf |accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ExpreS2ion announces EU grant award for the COVID-19 vaccine development programme |url=https://news.cision.com/expres2ion-biotechnologies/r/expres2ion-announces-eu-grant-award-for-the-covid-19-vaccine-development-programme,c3054055 |website=[[Cision]] |accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Universiteit Leiden]]\n* [[Leiden]]\n* ''[[Homunculus loxodontus]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|http://www.lumc.nl}}  LUMC\n\n{{Leiden University}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Leiden University|Medical Centre]]\n[[Category:Teaching hospitals in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Academic health science centres]]\n[[Category:Hospitals established in 1873]]\n[[Category:1873 establishments in the Netherlands]]\n", "text_old": "{{2p|date=June 2017}}\n{{Infobox hospital\n| name        = Leiden University Medical Center\n| org/group   = \n| logo        = LUMC logo.svg\n| logo_size   = \n| image       = LUMC.jpg\n| image_size  = 225 \n| alt         = \n| caption     = \n| latitude    = \n| longitude   = \n| coordinates = {{coord|52|09|57|N|4|28|39|E|display=inline,title|region:NL_type:landmark_source:nlwiki}}\n| location    = Albinusdreef 2, 2333 ZA [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]]\n| region      = \n| state       = \n| country     = \n| healthcare  = <!-- UK: NHS; AU/CA: Medicare; ELSE free-form text, e.g. Private -->\n| funding     = \n| type        = \n| affiliation = [[Leiden University]]\n| patron      = \n| network     = \n| standards   = \n| emergency   = Yes, [[Level I trauma center]]\n| helipad     = \n| beds        = \n| speciality  = \n| founded     = 1996\n| closed      = \n| demolished  = \n| website     = {{URL|www.lumc.nl}}\n| other_links = \n| module      = \n}}\n'''Leiden University Medical Center''' (Dutch: ''Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum'') or '''LUMC''' is the university hospital affiliated with [[Leiden University]], of which it forms the [[medical faculty]].
