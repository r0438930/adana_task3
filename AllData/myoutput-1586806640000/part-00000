I-495 is widely known as the '''Capital Beltway''', or simply '''the Beltway''', especially when the context of Washington, D.C., is clear. It is the basis of the phrase \"[[inside the Beltway]]\", used when referring to issues dealing with American [[government]] and [[politics]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] utilizes the southern and eastern half of the Capital Beltway to circumnavigate Washington, D.C., and is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-495 along that portion.\n\nThis [[loop road|circumferential roadway]] is located not only in the states of Virginia and Maryland, but also crosses briefly through the District of Columbia, near the western end of the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]].  The Beltway passes through [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] in Maryland, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in Virginia.\n\nThe [[Cabin John Parkway]], a short connector between I-495 and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] near the Potomac River along the Maryland\u2013Virginia border, is considered an Interstate [[highway spur|spur]] (I-495X) by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]].\n\n==Route description==\nExcept for the westernmost part of Woodrow Wilson Bridge south of downtown Washington (the water below is considered part of the District of Columbia), the Capital Beltway encircles [[Washington, D.C.]], in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. The two directions of travel, [[clockwise]] and [[counterclockwise]] (looking at a map), have become known respectively as the \"'''Inner Loop'''\" and the \"'''Outer Loop'''\". The route descriptions below follow the direction of the Outer Loop, starting at the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, south of Washington.\n\n[[File:2018-10-31 14 23 17 Signs for Interstate 495 and the Capital Beltway along eastbound U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard) just west of Virginia State Route 650 (Gallows Road) in Woodburn, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|120px|left|I-495/Capital Beltway signage in Virginia]]\nMost Beltway interchanges provide access to Washington, with [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] and [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|I-295]] from the south, [[Interstate 66|I-66]] from the west, and [[U.S. Route 50|US 50]] from both the west and the east among the most frequently used. More scenic routes from the Beltway into the District are offered by the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] along the Virginia side of the Potomac, the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Maryland side of the river, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], approaching Washington from the northeast.\n\nOriginally, the entire Beltway was simply I-495, and [[Interstate 95|I-95]] was planned to serve downtown Washington, D.C., from the south and north, intersecting the Beltway in Virginia and in Maryland.  However, environmental litigation stopped completion of this plan, and the built portion of I-95 inside the Beltway from the south northward into downtown Washington was redesignated [[Interstate 395 (Virginia\u2013District of Columbia)|I-395]] in 1977.  The small built portion from the north was converted into a park-and-ride lot. I-95 was then rerouted (and so signed) along the eastern side of the Beltway, with the I-495 designation left only along the western side.  In 1989, the I-495 designation was returned to the eastern portion as well, with the highway co-signed as I-95 and I-495 along this route.\n\n===I-95/I-495 concurrency in the District of Columbia===\n[[File:2007 04 25 - WWB 44.JPG|left|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] carrying I-95/I-495 over the [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and [[Oxon Hill, Maryland]] (2007)]]\nThe Beltway (here I-95 and I-495 together), four lanes in each direction, travels over the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[estuary|tidal]] [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].

After crossing the Potomac, I-95/I-495 narrows to eight lanes with two local and two express lanes in each direction, and immediately meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]], known as the Anacostia Freeway, a route that serves downtown [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to the north, connecting in Washington to [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 695]]. This large interchange also connects to National Harbor Boulevard which links the National Harbor with the Beltway and I-295. The highway passes south of [[Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm]] and next intersects [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]] (Indian Head Highway) , a major north\u2013south route from southern D.C. to [[Indian Head, Maryland|Indian Head]] in [[Charles County, Maryland]], which also serves the town of Forest Heights to the north at another interconnected interchange.\n\nHeading eastward, the Beltway's (I-95/I-495) local\u2013express lane configuration ends before it interchanges with various local highways, including [[Maryland Route 5|MD 5]] and [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] on either side of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], which the Beltway travels near its northern edge. (Both MD 5 and MD 4 extend westward into D.C., and southeastward into [[Southern Maryland]].) Past the MD 4 interchange, the Beltway turns north through [[Glenarden, Maryland|Glenarden]], interchanging with [[Maryland Route 202|MD 202]].\n\nThe Beltway then interchanges with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]]/unsigned [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], a major highway from downtown Washington eastward to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] to Maryland's [[Eastern Shore, Maryland|Eastern Shore]]. Both US 50 and MD 450 (which interchanges with the Beltway slightly northward) provide access to the New Carrollton [[New Carrollton (Washington Metro)|Metro]], [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail, and [[Amtrak]] stations, and the [[New Carrollton, Maryland|New Carrollton]] area.\n[[File:Washington Beltway I-495.jpg|thumb|left|I-495/I-95 Northbound in Maryland, at the Rhode Island Ave. overpass]]\n\nTurning northwest, the Beltway then enters [[Greenbelt Park]], intersecting the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]] (B-W Parkway) in the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B-W Parkway, I-95/I-495 passes an interchange with [[Maryland Route 201|MD 201]], which connects to the southern terminus of the B-W Parkway at US&nbsp;50 near the D.C. line. Now turned fully west, the Beltway runs through the northern edge of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], interchanging with the access roadway for the [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]] [[Greenbelt (Washington Metro)|Metro]] and [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail stations, then [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]].\n\nBeyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 separates from I-495 at the College Park Interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway, while I-95 turns northeast towards [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The interchange includes access to a [[Park and Ride]] lot which was originally paved as part of I-95's route within the Beltway.\n\n===I-495 in Maryland===\nContinuing west from the College Park Interchange, I-495 crosses into [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], entering a heavily developed and populated area. Passing underneath [[Maryland Route 212|MD 212]] with no access, the route interchanges with [[Maryland Route 650|MD 650]] near the [[George Washington Cemetery]]. After bisecting [[Northwest Branch Park]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 193|MD 193]] and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] south of [[Four Corners, Maryland|Four Corners]]; the two interchanges are little more than 1/2 mile apart. Southbound US 29 is the main route into downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], continuing into Washington.\n\nSqueezing past [[Argyle Park]] and [[Sligo Creek Golf Course]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 97|MD 97]] northwest of Silver Spring, then follows an alignment formerly known as '''Rock Creek Parkway'''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Not the extant parkway in Rock Creek Park within D.C.</ref> The route twists along the alignment, through and around [[Rock Creek Park]], then interchanges with [[Maryland Route 185|MD 185]] near the [[National Naval Medical Center]]. Turning northwest, I-495 soon encounters the southern terminus of [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]], which extends northwestward to meet [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Frederick, Maryland]].\n\n[[File:I495 MD 10 2005 165.JPG|left|thumb|I-270/I-495 split (October 2005)]]\nI-270 and I-495 split at a highly complex Y-junction, with two separate HOV connections to I-270's HOV lanes and separate ramps to and from [[Maryland Route 355|MD 355]] (formerly [[U.S. Route 240|US 240]]). The old Rock Creek Parkway alignment follows I-270 north, while I-495 turns west and enters the only other six-lane segment of the Beltway still in existence; significant levels of traffic exit onto I-270 north, leaving the six-lane segment west of the split adequate.\n[[File:2016-01-22 09 58 00 View west along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at a signed 50 mph left curve west of Exit 36 in North Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp curve on the outer loop of the Beltway at the interchange with I-270 Spur in North Bethesda]]\nInterchanging with Old Georgetown Road ([[Maryland Route 187|MD 187]]), I-495 soon meets the [[Interstate 270 Spur]], the other side of the I-270/I-495 triangle. I-495 joins I-270 Spur at a converging [[Interchange (road)#Full Y interchange|wye]] junction; Inner Loop traffic exits from itself at the southern terminus of I-270 Spur, while Outer Loop traffic crosses the spur and enters it from the right. The two carriageways of I-495 temporarily widen to five lanes each until the [[Maryland Route 190|MD 190]] and [[Cabin John Parkway]] interchanges.  (MD 190 provides access to the northwestern portion of Washington, D.C., and to the [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]] and [[Great Falls, Maryland]] areas of Maryland's [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], while the Cabin John Parkway extends to the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Potomac River.)\n\nAfter these interchanges, the Beltway then narrows to eight lanes again. Turning sharply to the west, I-495 meets the Clara Barton Parkway along the north side of the [[Potomac River]];  this parkway provides a scenic route eastward into the western part of Washington, and westward toward the Potomac River's [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]].  After this interchange, the Beltway soon crosses the [[Mather Gorge|Potomac Gorge]] into [[Virginia]] over the ten-lane [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]].\n[[File:2015-12-08 14 07 24 View northeast towards the American Legion Memorial Bridge (Interstate 495) connecting Montgomery County, Maryland and Fairfax County, Virginia from the south bank of the Potomac River.jpg|left|thumb|American Legion Memorial Bridge carrying the western section of the Beltway over the Potomac River (2015)]]\n\n===I-495 in Virginia===\n{{See also|Virginia HOT lanes#495 Express Lanes}}\n\nImmediately after crossing into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia, I-495 encounters the western terminus of the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] at a [[trumpet interchange]];  the Parkway provides a scenic route to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia, and downtown Washington.  The Beltway then continues south, next interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 193|VA 193]] south of [[Dranesville District Park]], then reaches the extensive triangle of interchanges between I-495, the [[Dulles Airport Access Road]], [[Virginia State Route 267|VA 267]], and [[Virginia State Route 123|VA 123]]. The eastbound Dulles Access Road here also provides access to I-66 for Outer Loop Beltway traffic.  The former interchange with the toll road (VA 267) is a directional interchange, while the latter is a cloverleaf; the entire complex occurs east of the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] business district.\n\nNow running south, the Beltway interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 7|VA 7]] (Leesburg Pike) east of Tysons Corner; passing [[Dunn Loring, Virginia|Dunn Loring]] to the east, I-495 soon reaches the complex interchange with [[Interstate 66]], which extends westward to [[I-81]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] near [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]], Virginia, and eastward to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington. In a similar design as the I-270/I-495 interchange, dedicated HOV connections exist between I-495 and I-66, with many reversible and other directional ramps providing the remaining connections. There is no access between the Outer Loop and eastbound I-66 at this interchange. Instead, Outer Loop traffic must use the eastbound [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] exit 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) to the north in order to reach I-66 East.<ref group=lower-alpha>If a driver gets onto westbound I-66 at the Leesburg Pike (SR&nbsp;7) entrance, the only choice for getting to northbound I-495 is to take I-66 west to the Nutley Street exit and then get on I-66 east. A similar situation occurs for going from the [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] at Chain Bridge Road ([[Virginia State Route 123|SR&nbsp;123]]) to southbound I-495, where it is assumed that the driver will know to continue along SR&nbsp;7 or SR&nbsp;123 directly to the Beltway.</ref> There are multiple ramps from I-66 east to the Inner Loop, with one ramp exiting from the left side of I-66 east and the other exiting from the right. The [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] leads to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], which then changes over to the [[Dulles Greenway]] and ends at [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]].\n\nSouth of the I-66 interchange, the Beltway crosses under [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[Virginia State Route 237|VA 237]] with no access, then encounters a large braided interchange between I-495, [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|US 50]], and two local roads; the direct interchange between I-495 and US 50 is a full cloverleaf, while the braided local interchanges between I-495, US 50, and the local roads are modified [[SPUI]]s. The entire complex is bounded on the northeast side by Fairview Lake and on the southwest side by an office complex.\n\nContinuing due south, the route then interchanges with Gallows Road, then skirts the eastern edge of [[Mill Creek Park (Virginia)|Mill Creek Park]] before interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 236|VA 236]] southwest of [[Annandale Community Park]]. Running along the eastern edge of [[Wakefield Park (Annandale, Virginia)|Wakefield Park]], the Beltway turns southeast and interchanges with [[State Route 620 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 620]] before turning east near [[Flag Run Park]] and entering [[Springfield, Virginia|Springfield]], meeting the [[Springfield Interchange]] with I-95 southeast of the [[Shirley Industrial Complex]].\n\n===I-95/I-495 concurrency in Virginia===\n\nI-95 joins the Beltway within the [[Springfield Interchange]]. I-495 also meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 395 (Virginia)|Interstate 395]] within the same massive interchange complex.\n[[File:Capital Beltway from Metro bridge.jpg|thumb|left|I-95/I-495 in Alexandria, seen from the [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]]]]\nRunning due east away from the interchange, crossing to the south of [[Backlick Stream Valley Park]], the Beltway (now I-95/I495) interchanges with [[State Route 613 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 613]] a mile east of the Springfield Interchange. Continuing east, the Beltway encounters a diamond interchange with a connector road linking to Eisenhower Avenue, which parallels the Beltway for a short distance. Skirting the northern edges of [[Loftridge Park]] and [[Burgundy Park]] the two routes enter [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and soon reach [[Virginia State Route 241|VA 241]], a direct route into the city, currently under major reconstruction. Within the interchange, the Beltway nears the western approach to the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.\n[[File:2016-09-07 12 53 27 \"Welcome to Virginia\" sign along southbound Interstate 95 and the westbound inner loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) as it crosses the Potomac River on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Alexandria, Virginia.jpg|left|thumb|Virginia welcome sign on the Inner Loop over the Wilson Bridge.

Finally, beyond this complex interchange, I-95 and I-495 together cross Alexandria's  [[Jones Point Park]] and exit Virginia via the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]].\n\n==History==\nThe idea of building a highway around the Washington suburbs had been discussed at least since 1944, when Fred W.

The first section of the {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} long Beltway (including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge|Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]]) was opened on December 21, 1961; the highway was completed on August 17, 1964.\n\nOriginally designated I-495, in 1977 the eastern portion of the Beltway was re-designated [[Interstate 95|I-95]] when a proposed alignment of I-95 from [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., through [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] to I-495 was canceled. Motorists never fully adjusted to the two halves of the Beltway having different numbers. According to Ron Shaffer of the ''Washington Post'',\n\n{{quote|There were signs stating that to continue on the Beltway, you had to get off at the next exit, when all you really had to do was keep going straight.

This parlance too has led to its own confusion, with unfamiliar motorists imagining two separate, distinct highway alignments, one some distance inside the other. At entrance ramps to the Beltway and on the on-highway signage, \"Inner Loop\" and \"Outer Loop\" shields are posted in conjunction with the route marker shields, although the terms are not emphasized in signage.\n\nThe Beltway was originally envisioned as primarily a bypass for long-distance eastern seaboard traffic to avoid driving directly through Washington. However, the explosive growth both of housing and business in the Washington suburbs following the Beltway's completion quickly made the Beltway the area's \"main street\" for local traffic as well. Numerous large shopping malls, community colleges, sports and concert stadiums, and corporate employment centers were purposely built adjacent to the Beltway, and these added greatly to the traffic, as has the passenger growth of regional airports accessed by the Beltway. The formerly more affordable price of housing in Southern Maryland versus [[Northern Virginia]], also led tens of thousands of commuters to live in Southern Maryland and commute on the Beltway to Virginia. The newer [[Fairfax County Parkway]] in the 1990s helped ease some traffic on the Virginia beltway; however, various proposals to build another complete [[Washington Outer Beltway|outer beltway]] in the outer suburbs has not gotten off the ground, because local governments in Maryland object to building additional [[Potomac River]] crossings as well as destroying protected \"open space\" and creating [[suburban sprawl|sprawl]].\n\n===College Park Interchange===\n[[File:College Park Interchange.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the College Park Interchange]]\n[[File:2019-06-03 11 53 32 View north along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway at the split between Interstate 95 North towards Baltimore and Interstate 495 West towards Silver Spring in Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The I-95/I-495 split at College Park, Maryland]]\nThe College Park Interchange is the informal name for the northern interchange between I-95 and I-495 in College Park. The interchange was partially opened, along with the connecting segment of I-95, in 1971, completing I-95 between the Baltimore Beltway and the Capital Beltway. As originally planned, it was designed with the idea that mainline I-95 through traffic would continue straight through the interchange and south into [[Washington D.C.]] as the [[Northeast Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|Northeast Freeway]], joining the [[North Central Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|North Central Freeway]] within D.C. and running south towards the central business district. When the D.C. government canceled its segment of I-95 in 1977, I-95 was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Capital Beltway, which lost its designation as I-495 (this was restored in 1989, forming a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] of I-95 and I-495 on the eastern half). As a result of this rerouting, the interchange was placed under considerable pressure to cater for a traffic flow that it was not designed to handle.\n\nOriginally, travelers from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had to traverse the one-lane cloverleaf ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained for access to the new C-D lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump end of the interchange was also modified into its present configuration, and the [[Park and Ride]] was built.\n\n===Traffic congestion===\nDespite numerous widening projects during its history, heavy traffic on the Beltway is a continuing problem. The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]\u2014where eight lanes were squeezed into six\u2014was particularly onerous, with miles-long backups daily during commuter rush hours and on heavily traveled weekends. Relief for this bottleneck came on May 30, 2008, when the 12-lane replacement bridge opened to traffic in both directions (the six-lane span carrying Outer Loop traffic had opened in June 2006). Two of the lanes on the Wilson are being held in reserve  for future use as bus rapid transit or rail transit.\n\n[[File:2019-05-29 17 54 50 View south along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at Exit 57A (Interstate 95 South, Richmond) along the edge of North Springfield and Springfield in Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-495 approaching the Springfield Interchange in Springfield, Virginia]]\nTwo intersections on the Capital Beltway are ranked in the top 20 on a study of the \"worst bottlenecks in the nation.\" They are the I-495 at [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]] interchange in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], ranked third overall, which receives 760,425 cars daily, and the College Park Interchange in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], ranked 11th, with 340,125 cars. The [[Springfield Interchange]], where [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|I-395]], I-95, and I-495 meet, was previously ranked fifth worst in the nation, but recent improvements have taken it off the top 20. Local commuters refer to the Springfield Interchange as \"The Mixing Bowl,\" although this designation is reserved by highway officials for the even more complicated [[Pentagon road network|interchange]] complex adjacent to [[The Pentagon]] on the original [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] (currently better-known as [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]]) at [[Virginia State Route 27|State Route 27]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]].\n\nIn April 2005, the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] signed an agreement with two private companies to build [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes on the stretch of the Beltway between Springfield and Georgetown Pike.  Construction began in 2008. Maryland officials are considering such lanes on their segment of the Beltway, as well as other major commuter highways in the state. Locals who disapprove of these projects have nicknamed them \"[[Lexus]] Lanes\" because of the potential high price for using the lanes in exchange for bypassing congestion. These new lanes are one stage of a controversial project to widen the beltway, with the second stage involving widening the beltway to 12 lanes; opponents have called for various alternatives to this project (as well as the controversial [[Maryland Route 200|Intercounty Connector]] project) which would divert many vehicles off the northern beltway. The [[Maryland Transit Administration]]'s proposed [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]] light rail transit line is just one example.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |title = The Beltway |publisher = Coalition for Smarter Growth |accessdate = August 24, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091220004753/http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |archive-date = December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Beltway has been improved since it opened. The American Legion Bridge was expanded by two lanes. HOV lanes were added between River Road and the I-270 Spur in Montgomery County, Maryland. The interchange between I-95 and the Beltway in Prince George's County, Maryland was originally designed to be a cloverleaf to allow I-95 to extend southward toward the District of Columbia. After I-95 was realigned onto the Beltway, a flyover ramp was built to allow I-95 through traffic to have two high-speed lanes. The interchange between U.S. Route 50 and I-95/I-495 in Prince George's County, Maryland was upgraded from a simple cloverleaf to a hybrid turbine interchange. In the Beltway's original configuration, I-295 and Indian Head Highway had separate interchanges. As a result, north-south traffic between I-295 and Indian Head Highway was forced to merge onto a congested section of the Beltway for approximately one mile. As a congestion relief measure, I-295 was extended over the Beltway and continued parallel to it so that the two highways were directly connected independent of the beltway. However, these interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate the expansion of the Wilson Bridge and the construction of dedicated ramps to National Harbor.\n\nIn January 2018, Maryland State Democratic Sen. [[Joanne C. Benson|Joanne Benson]] of Prince George's County proposed legislation (Senate Bill 55) to increase the speed limit of the Maryland section of the Beltway from 55 to 70&nbsp;mph, in a bid to reduce traffic congestion on the Beltway.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://wtop.com/dc-transit/2018/01/hit-the-gas-md-lawmaker-wants-to-up-speed-limits-on-i-495-i-270/ |title = Hit the gas: Md. lawmaker wants to up speed limits on Capital Beltway, I-270 |date = January 19, 2018 |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WTOP-FM]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en-US }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Maryland-Proposal-Boost-Beltway-I-270-Speed-Limits-70-Mph-470205523.html |title = Proposal Would Boost Beltway, I-270 Speed Limits to 70 Mph |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WRC-TV]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n===Current roadworks===\n[[File:Woodrow wilson bridge june06.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] under reconstruction, June 2006]]\nThe [[Springfield Interchange]] in Virginia completed reconstruction in 2007.  The eight-year, nearly $676 million project worked to eliminate weaving among local and long-distance traffic between I-95, I-395, the Beltway, and [[Virginia State Route 644 (Fairfax County)|State Route 644]].\n\nThe [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] underwent reconstruction in a major project that began in 1999; it now provides express and local lanes for both the Inner and Outer Loops. The new Wilson Bridge is higher and wider than the original 1961 span, which was demolished in 2006. The Outer Loop span opened in June 2006, and the Inner Loop span opened in May 2008.\n\nAlso, in association with the Wilson Bridge project, the [[Virginia State Route 241|Telegraph Road]] and [[U.S. 1]] interchanges (exits 176 and 177) in Alexandria, Virginia were rebuilt. The [[Interstate 295 (Maryland)|I-295]] and [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]]  interchanges (exits 2 and 3) in Maryland were rebuilt as well. These improvement lasted through 2013.\n\nThe Branch Avenue ([[Maryland Route 5]]) Interchange was also improved.\n\n===Virginia HOT lanes===\n{{main|Virginia HOT lanes}}\n[[File:VA 07 2012 I495 HOT facility 3664.JPG|thumb|300px|495 Express Lanes ([[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|HOT lanes]]) under construction at the I-495 interchange with [[Virginia State Route 123|Route 123]] in [[Tysons Corner]].

Originally, all exits on the Beltway were numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction, starting with exit 1 for US 1 in Alexandria. After the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered in 1977 as [[Interstate 95]], exits on the Maryland portion were renumbered to the current format, counterclockwise with exit numbers assigned to mileposts.  This caused problems because there were some exits that had the same number in Maryland and Virginia.  Around 2000, this problem was solved by renumbering all of the Virginia exits. The exit numbers between the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Springfield Interchange]]\u2014Interstate 495's intersection with [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95 in Virginia]]\u2014became a continuation of the Maryland exit numbers from the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] to the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]]. The exit numbers between the [[Springfield Interchange]] and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge became a continuation of the exit numbers of I-95 in Virginia; such exit numbers are much higher than those on the rest of the Beltway, but continue to increase in the counterclockwise direction. The counterclockwise numbering on the Capital Beltway is a rarity, as most similar loop highways, like the [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Baltimore Beltway]], have their exit numbers/mileage set in a clockwise arrangement.\n\n==Exit list==\n===Mainline===\nThe Commonwealth of Virginia formerly reset exit numbers at state lines, and numbered them from the counterclockwise end to the clockwise end.{{jcttop|old|state_col=State|old_ref=<ref>{{cite map |author = [[H.M.

I-495 is widely known as the '''Capital Beltway''', or simply '''the Beltway''', especially when the context of Washington, D.C., is clear. It is the basis of the phrase \"[[inside the Beltway]]\", used when referring to issues dealing with American [[government]] and [[politics]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] utilizes the southern and eastern half of the Capital Beltway to circumnavigate Washington, D.C., and is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-495 along that portion.\n\nThis [[loop road|circumferential roadway]] is located not only in the states of Virginia and Maryland, but also crosses briefly through the District of Columbia, near the western end of the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]].  The Beltway passes through [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] in Maryland, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in Virginia.\n\nThe [[Cabin John Parkway]], a short connector between I-495 and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] near the Potomac River along the Maryland\u2013Virginia border, is considered an Interstate [[highway spur|spur]] (I-495X) by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]].\n\n==Route description==\nExcept for the westernmost part of Woodrow Wilson Bridge south of downtown Washington (the water below is considered part of the District of Columbia), the Capital Beltway encircles [[Washington, D.C.]], in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. The two directions of travel, [[clockwise]] and [[counterclockwise]] (looking at a map), have become known respectively as the \"'''Inner Loop'''\" and the \"'''Outer Loop'''\". The route descriptions below follow the direction of the Outer Loop, starting at the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, south of Washington.\n\n[[File:2018-10-31 14 23 17 Signs for Interstate 495 and the Capital Beltway along eastbound U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard) just west of Virginia State Route 650 (Gallows Road) in Woodburn, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|120px|left|I-495/Capital Beltway signage in Virginia]]\nMost Beltway interchanges provide access to Washington, with [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] and [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|I-295]] from the south, [[Interstate 66|I-66]] from the west, and [[U.S. Route 50|US 50]] from both the west and the east among the most frequently used. More scenic routes from the Beltway into the District are offered by the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] along the Virginia side of the Potomac, the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Maryland side of the river, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], approaching Washington from the northeast.\n\nOriginally, the entire Beltway was simply I-495, and [[Interstate 95|I-95]] was planned to serve downtown Washington, D.C., from the south and north, intersecting the Beltway in Virginia and in Maryland.  However, environmental litigation stopped completion of this plan, and the built portion of I-95 inside the Beltway from the south northward into downtown Washington was redesignated [[Interstate 395 (Virginia\u2013District of Columbia)|I-395]] in 1977.  The small built portion from the north was converted into a park-and-ride lot. I-95 was then rerouted (and so signed) along the eastern side of the Beltway, with the I-495 designation left only along the western side.

After crossing the Potomac, I-95/I-495 narrows to eight lanes with two local and two express lanes in each direction, and immediately meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]], known as the [[Anacostia]] Freeway, a route that serves downtown [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to the north, connecting in Washington to [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 695]]. This large interchange also connects to National Harbor Boulevard which links the National Harbor with the Beltway and I-295. The highway passes south of [[Oxon Cove Park & Oxon Hill Farm]] and next intersects [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]] (Indian Head Highway) , a major north\u2013south route from southern D.C. to [[Indian Head, Maryland|Indian Head]] in [[Charles County, Maryland]], which also serves the town of Forest Heights to the north at another interconnected interchange.\n\nHeading eastward, the Beltway's (I-95/I-495) local\u2013express lane configuration ends before it interchanges with various local highways, including [[Maryland Route 5|MD 5]] and [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] on either side of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], which the Beltway travels near its northern edge. (Both MD 5 and MD 4 extend westward into D.C., and southeastward into [[Southern Maryland]].)  Past the MD 4 interchange, the Beltway turns north through [[Glenarden, Maryland|Glenarden]], interchanging with [[Maryland Route 202|MD 202]].\n\nThe Beltway then interchanges with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]]/unsigned [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], a major highway from downtown Washington eastward to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] to Maryland's [[Eastern Shore, Maryland|Eastern Shore]].  Both US 50 and MD 450 (which interchanges with the Beltway slightly northward) provide access to the New Carrollton [[New Carrollton (Washington Metro)|Metro]], [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail, and [[Amtrak]] stations, and the [[New Carrollton, Maryland|New Carrollton]] area.\n[[File:Washington Beltway I-495.jpg|thumb|left|I-495/I-95 Northbound in Maryland, at the Rhode Island Ave. overpass]]\n\nTurning northwest, the Beltway then enters [[Greenbelt Park]], intersecting the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]] (B-W Parkway) in the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B-W Parkway, I-95/I-495 passes an interchange with [[Maryland Route 201|MD 201]], which connects to the southern terminus of the B-W Parkway at US&nbsp;50 near the D.C. line. Now turned fully west, the Beltway runs through the northern edge of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], interchanging with the access roadway for the [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]] [[Greenbelt (Washington Metro)|Metro]] and [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail stations, then [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]].\n\nBeyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 separates from I-495 at the College Park Interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway, while I-95 turns northeast towards [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The interchange includes access to a [[Park and Ride]] lot which was originally paved as part of I-95's route within the Beltway.\n\n===I-495 in Maryland===\nContinuing west from the College Park Interchange, I-495 crosses into [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], entering a heavily developed and populated area. Passing underneath [[Maryland Route 212|MD 212]] with no access, the route interchanges with [[Maryland Route 650|MD 650]] near the [[George Washington Cemetery]]. After bisecting [[Northwest Branch Park]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 193|MD 193]] and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] south of [[Four Corners, Maryland|Four Corners]]; the two interchanges are little more than 1/2 mile apart. Southbound US 29 is the main route into downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], continuing into Washington.\n\nSqueezing past [[Argyle Park]] and [[Sligo Creek Golf Course]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 97|MD 97]] northwest of Silver Spring, then follows an alignment formerly known as '''Rock Creek Parkway'''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Not the extant parkway in Rock Creek Park within D.C.</ref> The route twists along the alignment, through and around [[Rock Creek Park]], then interchanges with [[Maryland Route 185|MD 185]] near the [[National Naval Medical Center]].

The old Rock Creek Parkway alignment follows I-270 north, while I-495 turns west and enters the only other six-lane segment of the Beltway still in existence; significant levels of traffic exit onto I-270 north, leaving the six-lane segment west of the split adequate.\n[[File:2016-01-22 09 58 00 View west along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at a signed 50 mph left curve west of Exit 36 in North Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp curve on the outer loop of the Beltway at the interchange with I-270 Spur in North Bethesda]]\nInterchanging with Old Georgetown Road ([[Maryland Route 187|MD 187]]), I-495 soon meets the [[Interstate 270 Spur]], the other side of the I-270/I-495 triangle. I-495 joins I-270 Spur at a converging [[Interchange (road)#Full Y interchange|wye]] junction; Inner Loop traffic exits from itself at the southern terminus of I-270 Spur, while Outer Loop traffic crosses the spur and enters it from the right. The two carriageways of I-495 temporarily widen to five lanes each until the [[Maryland Route 190|MD 190]] and [[Cabin John Parkway]] interchanges.  (MD 190 provides access to the northwestern portion of Washington, D.C., and to the [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]] and [[Great Falls, Maryland]] areas of Maryland's [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], while the Cabin John Parkway extends to the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Potomac River.)\n\nAfter these interchanges, the Beltway then narrows to eight lanes again. Turning sharply to the west, I-495 meets the Clara Barton Parkway along the north side of the [[Potomac River]];  this parkway provides a scenic route eastward into the western part of Washington, and westward toward the Potomac River's [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]].

The Beltway then continues south, next interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 193|VA 193]] south of [[Dranesville District Park]], then reaches the extensive triangle of interchanges between I-495, the [[Dulles Airport Access Road]], [[Virginia State Route 267|VA 267]], and [[Virginia State Route 123|VA 123]]. The eastbound Dulles Access Road here also provides access to I-66 for Outer Loop Beltway traffic.  The former interchange with the toll road (VA 267) is a directional interchange, while the latter is a cloverleaf; the entire complex occurs east of the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] business district.\n\nNow running south, the Beltway interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 7|VA 7]] (Leesburg Pike) east of Tysons Corner; passing [[Dunn Loring, Virginia|Dunn Loring]] to the east, I-495 soon reaches the complex interchange with [[Interstate 66]], which extends westward to [[I-81]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] near [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]], Virginia, and eastward to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington. In a similar design as the I-270/I-495 interchange, dedicated HOV connections exist between I-495 and I-66, with many reversible and other directional ramps providing the remaining connections. There is no access between the Outer Loop and eastbound I-66 at this interchange. Instead, Outer Loop traffic must use the eastbound [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] exit 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) to the north in order to reach I-66 East.<ref group=lower-alpha>If a driver gets onto westbound I-66 at the Leesburg Pike (SR&nbsp;7) entrance, the only choice for getting to northbound I-495 is to take I-66 west to the Nutley Street exit and then get on I-66 east.

The [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] leads to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], which then changes over to the [[Dulles Greenway]] and ends at [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]].\n\nSouth of the I-66 interchange, the Beltway crosses under [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[Virginia State Route 237|VA 237]] with no access, then encounters a large braided interchange between I-495, [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|US 50]], and two local roads; the direct interchange between I-495 and US 50 is a full cloverleaf, while the braided local interchanges between I-495, US 50, and the local roads are modified [[SPUI]]s. The entire complex is bounded on the northeast side by Fairview Lake and on the southwest side by an office complex.\n\nContinuing due south, the route then interchanges with Gallows Road, then skirts the eastern edge of [[Mill Creek Park (Virginia)|Mill Creek Park]] before interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 236|VA 236]] southwest of [[Annandale Community Park]]. Running along the eastern edge of [[Wakefield Park (Annandale, Virginia)|Wakefield Park]], the Beltway turns southeast and interchanges with [[State Route 620 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 620]] before turning east near [[Flag Run Park]] and entering [[Springfield, Virginia|Springfield]], meeting the [[Springfield Interchange]] with I-95 southeast of the [[Shirley Industrial Complex]].\n\n===I-95/I-495 concurrency in Virginia===\n\nI-95 joins the Beltway within the [[Springfield Interchange]]. I-495 also meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 395 (Virginia)|Interstate 395]] within the same massive interchange complex.\n[[File:Capital Beltway from Metro bridge.jpg|thumb|left|I-95/I-495 in Alexandria, seen from the [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]]]]\nRunning due east away from the interchange, crossing to the south of [[Backlick Stream Valley Park]], the Beltway (now I-95/I495) interchanges with [[State Route 613 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 613]] a mile east of the Springfield Interchange. Continuing east, the Beltway encounters a diamond interchange with a connector road linking to Eisenhower Avenue, which parallels the Beltway for a short distance. Skirting the northern edges of [[Loftridge Park]] and [[Burgundy Park]] the two routes enter [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and soon reach [[Virginia State Route 241|VA 241]], a direct route into the city, currently under major reconstruction.

The first section of the {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} long Beltway (including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge|Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]]) was opened on December 21, 1961; the highway was completed on August 17, 1964.\n\nOriginally designated I-495, in 1977 the eastern portion of the Beltway was re-designated [[Interstate 95|I-95]] when a proposed alignment of I-95 from [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., through [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] to I-495 was canceled. Motorists never fully adjusted to the two halves of the Beltway having different numbers. According to Ron Shaffer of the ''Washington Post'',\n\n{{quote|There were signs stating that to continue on the Beltway, you had to get off at the next exit, when all you really had to do was keep going straight.

This parlance too has led to its own confusion, with unfamiliar motorists imagining two separate, distinct highway alignments, one some distance inside the other. At entrance ramps to the Beltway and on the on-highway signage, \"Inner Loop\" and \"Outer Loop\" shields are posted in conjunction with the route marker shields, although the terms are not emphasized in signage.\n\nThe Beltway was originally envisioned as primarily a bypass for long-distance eastern seaboard traffic to avoid driving directly through Washington. However, the explosive growth both of housing and business in the Washington suburbs following the Beltway's completion quickly made the Beltway the area's \"main street\" for local traffic as well. Numerous large shopping malls, community colleges, sports and concert stadiums, and corporate employment centers were purposely built adjacent to the Beltway, and these added greatly to the traffic, as has the passenger growth of regional airports accessed by the Beltway. The formerly more affordable price of housing in Southern Maryland versus [[Northern Virginia]], also led tens of thousands of commuters to live in Southern Maryland and commute on the Beltway to Virginia. The newer [[Fairfax County Parkway]] in the 1990s helped ease some traffic on the Virginia beltway; however, various proposals to build another complete [[Washington Outer Beltway|outer beltway]] in the outer suburbs has not gotten off the ground, because local governments in Maryland object to building additional [[Potomac River]] crossings as well as destroying protected \"open space\" and creating [[suburban sprawl|sprawl]].\n\n===College Park Interchange===\n[[File:College Park Interchange.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the College Park Interchange]]\n[[File:2019-06-03 11 53 32 View north along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway at the split between Interstate 95 North towards Baltimore and Interstate 495 West towards Silver Spring in Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The I-95/I-495 split at College Park, Maryland]]\nThe College Park Interchange is the informal name for the northern interchange between I-95 and I-495 in College Park. The interchange was partially opened, along with the connecting segment of I-95, in 1971, completing I-95 between the Baltimore Beltway and the Capital Beltway. As originally planned, it was designed with the idea that mainline I-95 through traffic would continue straight through the interchange and south into [[Washington D.C.]] as the [[Northeast Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|Northeast Freeway]], joining the [[North Central Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|North Central Freeway]] within D.C. and running south towards the central business district. When the D.C. government canceled its segment of I-95 in 1977, I-95 was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Capital Beltway, which lost its designation as I-495 (this was restored in 1989, forming a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] of I-95 and I-495 on the eastern half). As a result of this rerouting, the interchange was placed under considerable pressure to cater for a traffic flow that it was not designed to handle.\n\nOriginally, travelers from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had to traverse the one-lane cloverleaf ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained for access to the new C-D lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump end of the interchange was also modified into its present configuration, and the [[Park and Ride]] was built.\n\n===Traffic congestion===\nDespite numerous widening projects during its history, heavy traffic on the Beltway is a continuing problem. The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]\u2014where eight lanes were squeezed into six\u2014was particularly onerous, with miles-long backups daily during commuter rush hours and on heavily traveled weekends. Relief for this bottleneck came on May 30, 2008, when the 12-lane replacement bridge opened to traffic in both directions (the six-lane span carrying Outer Loop traffic had opened in June 2006). Two of the lanes on the Wilson are being held in reserve  for future use as bus rapid transit or rail transit.\n\n[[File:2019-05-29 17 54 50 View south along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at Exit 57A (Interstate 95 South, Richmond) along the edge of North Springfield and Springfield in Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-495 approaching the Springfield Interchange in Springfield, Virginia]]\nTwo intersections on the Capital Beltway are ranked in the top 20 on a study of the \"worst bottlenecks in the nation.\" They are the I-495 at [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]] interchange in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], ranked third overall, which receives 760,425 cars daily, and the College Park Interchange in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], ranked 11th, with 340,125 cars. The [[Springfield Interchange]], where [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|I-395]], I-95, and I-495 meet, was previously ranked fifth worst in the nation, but recent improvements have taken it off the top 20. Local commuters refer to the Springfield Interchange as \"The Mixing Bowl,\" although this designation is reserved by highway officials for the even more complicated [[Pentagon road network|interchange]] complex adjacent to [[The Pentagon]] on the original [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] (currently better-known as [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]]) at [[Virginia State Route 27|State Route 27]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]].\n\nIn April 2005, the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] signed an agreement with two private companies to build [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes on the stretch of the Beltway between Springfield and Georgetown Pike.  Construction began in 2008. Maryland officials are considering such lanes on their segment of the Beltway, as well as other major commuter highways in the state. Locals who disapprove of these projects have nicknamed them \"[[Lexus]] Lanes\" because of the potential high price for using the lanes in exchange for bypassing congestion. These new lanes are one stage of a controversial project to widen the beltway, with the second stage involving widening the beltway to 12 lanes; opponents have called for various alternatives to this project (as well as the controversial [[Maryland Route 200|Intercounty Connector]] project) which would divert many vehicles off the northern beltway. The [[Maryland Transit Administration]]'s proposed [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]] light rail transit line is just one example.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |title = The Beltway |publisher = Coalition for Smarter Growth |accessdate = August 24, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091220004753/http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |archive-date = December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Beltway has been improved since it opened. The American Legion Bridge was expanded by two lanes. HOV lanes were added between River Road and the I-270 Spur in Montgomery County, Maryland. The interchange between I-95 and the Beltway in Prince George's County, Maryland was originally designed to be a cloverleaf to allow I-95 to extend southward toward the District of Columbia. After I-95 was realigned onto the Beltway, a flyover ramp was built to allow I-95 through traffic to have two high-speed lanes. The interchange between U.S. Route 50 and I-95/I-495 in Prince George's County, Maryland was upgraded from a simple cloverleaf to a hybrid turbine interchange. In the Beltway's original configuration, I-295 and Indian Head Highway had separate interchanges. As a result, north-south traffic between I-295 and Indian Head Highway was forced to merge onto a congested section of the Beltway for approximately one mile. As a congestion relief measure, I-295 was extended over the Beltway and continued parallel to it so that the two highways were directly connected independent of the beltway. However, these interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate the expansion of the Wilson Bridge and the construction of dedicated ramps to National Harbor.\n\nIn January 2018, Maryland State Democratic Sen.

The eight-year, nearly $676 million project worked to eliminate weaving among local and long-distance traffic between I-95, I-395, the Beltway, and [[Virginia State Route 644 (Fairfax County)|State Route 644]].\n\nThe [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] underwent reconstruction in a major project that began in 1999; it now provides express and local lanes for both the Inner and Outer Loops. The new Wilson Bridge is higher and wider than the original 1961 span, which was demolished in 2006. The Outer Loop span opened in June 2006, and the Inner Loop span opened in May 2008.\n\nAlso, in association with the Wilson Bridge project, the [[Virginia State Route 241|Telegraph Road]] and [[U.S. 1]] interchanges (exits 176 and 177) in Alexandria, Virginia were rebuilt. The [[Interstate 295 (Maryland)|I-295]] and [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]]  interchanges (exits 2 and 3) in Maryland were rebuilt as well. These improvement lasted through 2013.\n\nThe Branch Avenue ([[Maryland Route 5]]) Interchange was also improved.\n\n===Virginia HOT lanes===\n{{main|Virginia HOT lanes}}\n[[File:VA 07 2012 I495 HOT facility 3664.JPG|thumb|300px|495 Express Lanes ([[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|HOT lanes]]) under construction at the I-495 interchange with [[Virginia State Route 123|Route 123]] in [[Tysons Corner]].

However, elsewhere along the corridor, access to and from the HOT lanes is only permitted from cross roads.  Some cross roads provide access to both HOT lanes and general purpose lanes; others have access only to one system or the other.  Many HOT lane access points serve traffic in only one direction of I-495, which is intended to complement typical commuting patterns.

Originally, all exits on the Beltway were numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction, starting with exit 1 for US 1 in Alexandria. After the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered in 1977 as [[Interstate 95]], exits on the Maryland portion were renumbered to the current format, counterclockwise with exit numbers assigned to mileposts.  This caused problems because there were some exits that had the same number in Maryland and Virginia.  Around 2000, this problem was solved by renumbering all of the Virginia exits. The exit numbers between the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Springfield Interchange]]\u2014Interstate 495's intersection with [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95 in Virginia]]\u2014became a continuation of the Maryland exit numbers from the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] to the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]]. The exit numbers between the [[Springfield Interchange]] and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge became a continuation of the exit numbers of I-95 in Virginia; such exit numbers are much higher than those on the rest of the Beltway, but continue to increase in the counterclockwise direction. The counterclockwise numbering on the Capital Beltway is a rarity, as most similar loop highways, like the [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Baltimore Beltway]], have their exit numbers/mileage set in a clockwise arrangement.\n\n==Exit list==\n===Mainline===\nThe Commonwealth of Virginia formerly reset exit numbers at state lines, and numbered them from the counterclockwise end to the clockwise end.{{jcttop|old|state_col=State|old_ref=<ref>{{cite map |author = [[H.M.
