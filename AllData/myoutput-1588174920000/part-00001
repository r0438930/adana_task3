''V'' is the velocity of light.]]\nIn [[physics]] (specifically in [[electromagnetism]]) the '''Lorentz force''' (or '''electromagnetic force''') is the combination of electric and magnetic [[force]] on a [[point charge]] due to [[electromagnetic field]]s.

This article will ''not'' follow this nomenclature: In what follows, the term \"Lorentz force\" will refer to the expression for the total force.\n\nThe magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. In that context, it is also called the [[#Force on a current-carrying wire|Laplace force]].\n\nThe Lorentz force is a force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the charged particle, that is, it is the rate at which linear momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. Associated with it is the power which is the rate at which energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. That power is\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = q \\, \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}</math>.\nNotice that the magnetic field does not contribute to the power because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle.\n\n===Continuous charge distribution===\n\n[[File:Lorentz force continuum.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force (per unit 3-volume) '''f''' on a continuous [[charge distribution]] ([[charge density]] \u03c1) in motion.

See [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism#Charge continuum|Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]] for more details.\n\nThe density of power associated with the Lorentz force in a material medium is\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}</math>.\n\nIf we separate the total charge and total current into their free and bound parts, we get that the density of the Lorentz force is\n:<math>\\mathbf{f} = (\\rho_f - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf P) \\mathbf{E} + (\\mathbf{J}_f + \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{M} + \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{P}}{\\partial t}) \\times \\mathbf{B}</math>.\n\nwhere: <math>\\rho_f</math> is the density of free charge; <math>\\mathbf{P}</math> is the [[polarization density]]; <math>\\mathbf{J}_f</math> is the density of free current; and <math>\\mathbf{M}</math> is the [[magnetization]] density. In this way, the Lorentz force can explain the torque applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field. The density of the associated power is\n:<math>\\left(\\mathbf{J}_f + \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{M} + \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{P}}{\\partial t}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{E}</math>.\n\n===Equation in cgs units===\nThe above-mentioned formulae use [[SI units]] which are the most common among experimentalists, technicians, and engineers. In [[Gaussian units|cgs-Gaussian units]], which are somewhat more common among theoretical physicists as well as condensed matter experimentalists, one has instead\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = q_\\mathrm{cgs} \\left(\\mathbf{E}_\\mathrm{cgs} + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{c} \\times \\mathbf{B}_\\mathrm{cgs}\\right).</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. \nAlthough this equation looks slightly different, it is completely equivalent, since\none has the following relations:<ref name=units/>\n\n:<math>q_\\mathrm{cgs}=\\frac{q_\\mathrm{SI}}{\\sqrt{4\\pi \\epsilon_0}},\\quad \\mathbf E_\\mathrm{cgs} =\\sqrt{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\,\\mathbf E_\\mathrm{SI},\\quad \\mathbf B_\\mathrm{cgs} ={\\sqrt{4\\pi /\\mu_0}}\\,{\\mathbf B_\\mathrm{SI}},\\quad c=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ \\epsilon_0\\mu_0}}.</math>\n\nwhere \u03b5<sub>0</sub> is the [[vacuum permittivity]] and \u03bc<sub>0</sub> the [[vacuum permeability]]. In practice, the subscripts \"cgs\" and \"SI\" are always omitted, and the unit system has to be assessed from context.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n   | align = right\n   | position\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | footer = [[Charged particle]]s experiencing the Lorentz force.\n   | image1    = Lorentz force.svg\n   | caption1  = Trajectory of a particle with a positive or negative charge ''q'' under the influence of a magnetic field ''B'', which is directed perpendicularly out of the screen.\n   | width1     = 250\n   | image2    = Cyclotron motion.jpg\n   | caption2  = Beam of electrons moving in a circle, due to the presence of a magnetic field.

The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation.\n\n==Significance of the Lorentz force==\n\nWhile the modern Maxwell's equations describe how electrically charged particles and currents or moving charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force law completes that picture by describing the force acting on a moving point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.<ref name=Jackson2>See Jackson, page 2. The book lists the four modern Maxwell's equations, and then states, \"Also essential for consideration of charged particle motion is the Lorentz force equation, '''F''' = ''q'' ('''E'''+ '''v <big>\u00d7</big> B'''), which gives the force acting on a point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.\"</ref><ref name=Griffiths50>See Griffiths, page 326, which states that Maxwell's equations, \"together with the [Lorentz] force law...summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics\".</ref> The Lorentz force law describes the effect of '''E''' and '''B''' upon a point charge, but such electromagnetic forces are not the entire picture. Charged particles are possibly coupled to other forces, notably gravity and nuclear forces. Thus, Maxwell's equations do not stand separate from other physical laws, but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities. The response of a point charge to the Lorentz law is one aspect; the generation of '''E''' and '''B''' by currents and charges is another.\n\nIn real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle and as a matter of computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the '''E''' and '''B''' fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the [[Boltzmann equation]] or the [[Fokker\u2013Planck equation]] or the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. For example, see [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[electrohydrodynamics]], [[superconductivity]], [[stellar evolution]]. An entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed. See for example, [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] and [[Green's function (many-body theory)]].\n\n==Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B==\n\nIn many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force Law is used as the ''definition'' of the electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''B'''.<ref name=Jackson20>See, for example, Jackson, pp. 777\u20138.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A.

The fields are defined everywhere in space and time with respect to what force a test charge would receive regardless of whether a charge is present to experience the force.\n\nAs a definition of '''E''' and '''B''', the Lorentz force is only a definition in principle because a real particle (as opposed to the hypothetical \"test charge\" of infinitesimally-small mass and charge) would generate its own finite '''E''' and '''B''' fields, which would alter the electromagnetic force that it experiences. In addition, if the charge experiences acceleration, as if forced into a curved trajectory by some external agency, it emits radiation that causes braking of its motion. See for example [[Bremsstrahlung]] and [[synchrotron light]]. These effects occur through both a direct effect (called the [[Abraham\u2013Lorentz force|radiation reaction force]]) and indirectly (by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents). Moreover, net force must include [[gravity]], [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]], and any other forces aside from electromagnetic force.\n\n==Force on a current-carrying wire==\n[[File:Regla mano derecha Laplace.svg|right|thumb|250px|Right-hand rule for a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field ''B'']]\nWhen a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the '''Laplace force'''). By combining the Lorentz force law above with the definition of electric current, the following equation results, in the case of a straight, stationary wire:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicsexperiment.co.uk/content/bil.html|title=Physics Experiments|website=www.physicsexperiment.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = I \\boldsymbol{\\ell} \\times \\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nwhere '''\u2113''' is a vector whose magnitude is the length of wire, and whose direction is along the wire, aligned with the direction of [[conventional current]] charge flow ''I''.\n\nIf the wire is not straight but curved, the force on it can be computed by applying this formula to each [[infinitesimal]] segment of wire ''d'''''\u2113''', then adding up all these forces by [[integration (calculus)|integration]]. Formally, the net force on a stationary, rigid wire carrying a steady current ''I'' is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = I\\int \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}\\times \\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nThis is the net force. In addition, there will usually be [[torque]], plus other effects if the wire is not perfectly rigid.\n\nOne application of this is [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]], which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]].\n\n==EMF==\n\nThe magnetic force ({{nowrap|''q'''''v''' \u00d7 '''B'''}}) component of the Lorentz force is responsible for ''motional'' [[electromotive force]] (or ''motional EMF''), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term \"motional EMF\" is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF is due to the ''motion'' of the wire.\n\nIn other electrical generators, the magnets move, while the conductors do not. In this case, the EMF is due to the electric force (''q'''''E''') term in the Lorentz Force equation. The electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field, resulting in an ''induced'' EMF, as described by the [[Electromagnetic induction#Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation|Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation]] (one of the four modern [[Maxwell's equations]]).<ref name=Griffiths302>See Griffiths, pages 301\u20133.</ref>\n\nBoth of these EMFs, despite their apparently distinct origins, are described by the same equation, namely, the EMF is the rate of change of [[magnetic flux]] through the wire. (This is Faraday's law of induction, see [[Lorentz force#Lorentz force and Faraday.27s law of induction|below]].) Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]] was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects.<ref name=Griffiths302/> In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the [[solenoidal vector field]] portion of the ''E''-field can change in whole or in part to a ''B''-field or ''vice versa''.<ref name=Chow>\n{{cite book\n|author=Tai L.

However, there are cases where Faraday's law is either inadequate or difficult to use, and application of the underlying Lorentz force law is necessary. See [[Faraday paradox#Inapplicability of Faraday's law|inapplicability of Faraday's law]].\n\nIf the magnetic field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field, the magnetic flux \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub> linking the loop can change in several ways. For example, if the '''B'''-field varies with position, and the loop moves to a location with different '''B'''-field, \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub> will change. Alternatively, if the loop changes orientation with respect to the '''B'''-field, the {{nowrap|'''B''' &sdot; d'''A'''}} differential element will change because of the different angle between '''B''' and d'''A''', also changing \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub>. As a third example, if a portion of the circuit is swept through a uniform, time-independent '''B'''-field, and another portion of the circuit is held stationary, the flux linking the entire closed circuit can change due to the shift in relative position of the circuit's component parts with time (surface \u2202\u03a3(''t'') time-dependent). In all three cases, Faraday's law of induction then predicts the EMF generated by the change in \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub>.\n\nNote that the Maxwell Faraday's equation implies that the Electric Field '''E''' is non conservative when the Magnetic Field '''B''' varies in time, and is not expressible as the gradient of a [[scalar field]], and not subject to the [[gradient theorem]] since its rotational is not zero.<ref name=\"Landau\"/><ref>{{cite book\n|author=M N O Sadiku\n|title=Elements of electromagnetics\n|year= 2007\n|page =391\n|edition=Fourth\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|location=NY/Oxford\n|isbn=978-0-19-530048-2\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2ITHQAACAAJ&dq=ISBN0-19-530048-3}}</ref>\n\n==Lorentz force in terms of potentials==\n\n{{see also|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field|Maxwell's equations|Helmholtz decomposition}}\n\nThe '''E''' and '''B''' fields can be replaced by the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''' and ([[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]) [[electrostatic potential]] ''\u03d5''  by\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{E} = - \\nabla \\phi - \\frac { \\partial \\mathbf{A} } { \\partial t }</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}</math>\n\nwhere \u2207 is the gradient, \u2207\u22c5 is the divergence, \u2207\u00d7 is the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]].\n\nThe force becomes\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\left[-\\nabla \\phi- \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v}\\times(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A})\\right].</math>\n\nUsing an [[Triple product#Vector triple product|identity for the triple product]] this can be rewritten as,\n\n<math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\left[-\\nabla \\phi- \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\left(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{A} \\right)-\\left(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{A}\\right],</math>\n\n(Notice that the coordinates and the velocity components should be treated as independent variables, so the del operator acts only on <math>\\mathbf{A}</math>, not on <math>\\mathbf{v}</math>; thus, there is no need of using [[Vector calculus identities#Special notations|Feynman's subscript notation]] in the equation above).

This article will ''not'' follow this nomenclature: In what follows, the term \"Lorentz force\" will refer to the expression for the total force.\n\nThe magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. In that context, it is also called the [[#Force on a current-carrying wire|Laplace force]].\n\nThe Lorentz force is a force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the charged particle, that is, it is the rate at which linear momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. Associated with it is the power which is the rate at which energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. That power is\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = q \\, \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}</math>.\nNotice that the magnetic field does not contribute to the power because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle.\n\n===Continuous charge distribution===\n\n[[File:Lorentz force continuum.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force (per unit 3-volume) '''f''' on a continuous [[charge distribution]] ([[charge density]] \u03c1) in motion.

Rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields, this equation relates the [[energy flux]] (flow of ''energy'' per unit time per unit distance) in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. See [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism#Charge continuum|Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]] for more details.\n\nThe density of power associated with the Lorentz force in a material medium is\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}</math>.\n\nIf we separate the total charge and total current into their free and bound parts, we get that the density of the Lorentz force is\n:<math>\\mathbf{f} = (\\rho_f - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf P) \\mathbf{E} + (\\mathbf{J}_f + \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{M} + \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{P}}{\\partial t}) \\times \\mathbf{B}</math>.\n\nwhere: <math>\\rho_f</math> is the density of free charge; <math>\\mathbf{P}</math> is the [[polarization density]]; <math>\\mathbf{J}_f</math> is the density of free current; and <math>\\mathbf{M}</math> is the [[magnetization]] density. In this way, the Lorentz force can explain the torque applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field. The density of the associated power is\n:<math>\\left(\\mathbf{J}_f + \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{M} + \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{P}}{\\partial t}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{E}</math>.\n\n===Equation in cgs units===\nThe above-mentioned formulae use [[SI units]] which are the most common among experimentalists, technicians, and engineers. In [[Gaussian units|cgs-Gaussian units]], which are somewhat more common among theoretical physicists as well as condensed matter experimentalists, one has instead\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = q_\\mathrm{cgs} \\left(\\mathbf{E}_\\mathrm{cgs} + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{c} \\times \\mathbf{B}_\\mathrm{cgs}\\right).</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. \nAlthough this equation looks slightly different, it is completely equivalent, since\none has the following relations:<ref name=units/>\n\n:<math>q_\\mathrm{cgs}=\\frac{q_\\mathrm{SI}}{\\sqrt{4\\pi \\epsilon_0}},\\quad \\mathbf E_\\mathrm{cgs} =\\sqrt{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\,\\mathbf E_\\mathrm{SI},\\quad \\mathbf B_\\mathrm{cgs} ={\\sqrt{4\\pi /\\mu_0}}\\,{\\mathbf B_\\mathrm{SI}},\\quad c=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ \\epsilon_0\\mu_0}}.</math>\n\nwhere \u03b5<sub>0</sub> is the [[vacuum permittivity]] and \u03bc<sub>0</sub> the [[vacuum permeability]].

(A) No disturbing force (B) With an electric field, E (C) With an independent force, F (e.g. gravity) (D) In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, grad H]]\nIn many cases of practical interest, the motion in a [[magnetic field]] of an [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particle (such as an [[electron]] or [[ion]] in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) can be treated as the [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the '''guiding center''' and a relatively slow '''drift''' of this point. The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation.\n\n==Significance of the Lorentz force==\n\nWhile the modern Maxwell's equations describe how electrically charged particles and currents or moving charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force law completes that picture by describing the force acting on a moving point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.<ref name=Jackson2>See Jackson, page 2. The book lists the four modern Maxwell's equations, and then states, \"Also essential for consideration of charged particle motion is the Lorentz force equation, '''F''' = ''q'' ('''E'''+ '''v <big>\u00d7</big> B'''), which gives the force acting on a point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.\"</ref><ref name=Griffiths50>See Griffiths, page 326, which states that Maxwell's equations, \"together with the [Lorentz] force law...summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics\".</ref> The Lorentz force law describes the effect of '''E''' and '''B''' upon a point charge, but such electromagnetic forces are not the entire picture. Charged particles are possibly coupled to other forces, notably gravity and nuclear forces. Thus, Maxwell's equations do not stand separate from other physical laws, but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities. The response of a point charge to the Lorentz law is one aspect; the generation of '''E''' and '''B''' by currents and charges is another.\n\nIn real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle and as a matter of computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the '''E''' and '''B''' fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the [[Boltzmann equation]] or the [[Fokker\u2013Planck equation]] or the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. For example, see [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[electrohydrodynamics]], [[superconductivity]], [[stellar evolution]]. An entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed. See for example, [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] and [[Green's function (many-body theory)]].\n\n==Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B==\n\nIn many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force Law is used as the ''definition'' of the electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''B'''.<ref name=Jackson20>See, for example, Jackson, pp. 777\u20138.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A.

The fields are defined everywhere in space and time with respect to what force a test charge would receive regardless of whether a charge is present to experience the force.\n\nAs a definition of '''E''' and '''B''', the Lorentz force is only a definition in principle because a real particle (as opposed to the hypothetical \"test charge\" of infinitesimally-small mass and charge) would generate its own finite '''E''' and '''B''' fields, which would alter the electromagnetic force that it experiences. In addition, if the charge experiences acceleration, as if forced into a curved trajectory by some external agency, it emits radiation that causes braking of its motion. See for example [[Bremsstrahlung]] and [[synchrotron light]]. These effects occur through both a direct effect (called the [[Abraham\u2013Lorentz force|radiation reaction force]]) and indirectly (by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents). Moreover, net force must include [[gravity]], [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]], and any other forces aside from electromagnetic force.\n\n==Force on a current-carrying wire==\n[[File:Regla mano derecha Laplace.svg|right|thumb|250px|Right-hand rule for a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field ''B'']]\nWhen a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the '''Laplace force'''). By combining the Lorentz force law above with the definition of electric current, the following equation results, in the case of a straight, stationary wire:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicsexperiment.co.uk/content/bil.html|title=Physics Experiments|website=www.physicsexperiment.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = I \\boldsymbol{\\ell} \\times \\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nwhere '''\u2113''' is a vector whose magnitude is the length of wire, and whose direction is along the wire, aligned with the direction of [[conventional current]] charge flow ''I''.\n\nIf the wire is not straight but curved, the force on it can be computed by applying this formula to each [[infinitesimal]] segment of wire ''d'''''\u2113''', then adding up all these forces by [[integration (calculus)|integration]]. Formally, the net force on a stationary, rigid wire carrying a steady current ''I'' is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = I\\int \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}\\times \\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nThis is the net force. In addition, there will usually be [[torque]], plus other effects if the wire is not perfectly rigid.\n\nOne application of this is [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]], which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]].\n\n==EMF==\n\nThe magnetic force ({{nowrap|''q'''''v''' \u00d7 '''B'''}}) component of the Lorentz force is responsible for ''motional'' [[electromotive force]] (or ''motional EMF''), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term \"motional EMF\" is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF is due to the ''motion'' of the wire.\n\nIn other electrical generators, the magnets move, while the conductors do not. In this case, the EMF is due to the electric force (''q'''''E''') term in the Lorentz Force equation. The electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field, resulting in an ''induced'' EMF, as described by the [[Electromagnetic induction#Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation|Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation]] (one of the four modern [[Maxwell's equations]]).<ref name=Griffiths302>See Griffiths, pages 301\u20133.</ref>\n\nBoth of these EMFs, despite their apparently distinct origins, are described by the same equation, namely, the EMF is the rate of change of [[magnetic flux]] through the wire. (This is Faraday's law of induction, see [[Lorentz force#Lorentz force and Faraday.27s law of induction|below]].) Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]] was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects.<ref name=Griffiths302/> In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the [[solenoidal vector field]] portion of the ''E''-field can change in whole or in part to a ''B''-field or ''vice versa''.<ref name=Chow>\n{{cite book\n|author=Tai L.

However, there are cases where Faraday's law is either inadequate or difficult to use, and application of the underlying Lorentz force law is necessary. See [[Faraday paradox#Inapplicability of Faraday's law|inapplicability of Faraday's law]].\n\nIf the magnetic field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field, the magnetic flux \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub> linking the loop can change in several ways. For example, if the '''B'''-field varies with position, and the loop moves to a location with different '''B'''-field, \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub> will change. Alternatively, if the loop changes orientation with respect to the '''B'''-field, the {{nowrap|'''B''' &sdot; d'''A'''}} differential element will change because of the different angle between '''B''' and d'''A''', also changing \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub>. As a third example, if a portion of the circuit is swept through a uniform, time-independent '''B'''-field, and another portion of the circuit is held stationary, the flux linking the entire closed circuit can change due to the shift in relative position of the circuit's component parts with time (surface \u2202\u03a3(''t'') time-dependent). In all three cases, Faraday's law of induction then predicts the EMF generated by the change in \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub>.\n\nNote that the Maxwell Faraday's equation implies that the Electric Field '''E''' is non conservative when the Magnetic Field '''B''' varies in time, and is not expressible as the gradient of a [[scalar field]], and not subject to the [[gradient theorem]] since its rotational is not zero.<ref name=\"Landau\"/><ref>{{cite book\n|author=M N O Sadiku\n|title=Elements of electromagnetics\n|year= 2007\n|page =391\n|edition=Fourth\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|location=NY/Oxford\n|isbn=978-0-19-530048-2\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2ITHQAACAAJ&dq=ISBN0-19-530048-3}}</ref>\n\n==Lorentz force in terms of potentials==\n\n{{see also|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field|Maxwell's equations|Helmholtz decomposition}}\n\nThe '''E''' and '''B''' fields can be replaced by the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''' and ([[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]) [[electrostatic potential]] ''\u03d5''  by\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{E} = - \\nabla \\phi - \\frac { \\partial \\mathbf{A} } { \\partial t }</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}</math>\n\nwhere \u2207 is the gradient, \u2207\u22c5 is the divergence, \u2207\u00d7 is the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]].\n\nThe force becomes\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\left[-\\nabla \\phi- \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v}\\times(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A})\\right].</math>\n\nUsing an [[Triple product#Vector triple product|identity for the triple product]] this can be rewritten as,\n\n<math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\left[-\\nabla \\phi- \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\left(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{A} \\right)-\\left(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{A}\\right],</math>\n\n(notice that the derivatives act only on the coordinates of the source fields, not on the coordinates of the particle; thus there is no need of using [[Vector calculus identities#Special notations|Feynman's subscript notation]] in the equation above).\n\nUsing the chain rule, the [[total derivative]] of '''A''' is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}+(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nso the above expression can be rewritten as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\left[-\\nabla (\\phi-\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{A})- \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right]</math>.\n\nWith '''v''' = '''\u1e8b''', we can put the equation into the convenient Euler\u2013Lagrange form\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\left[-\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}(\\phi-\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A})+ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}}(\\phi-\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A})\\right]</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\n\nwhere\n\n<math>\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\hat{x} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\hat{y} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\hat{z} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial z}</math>\n\nand\n\n<math>\\nabla_{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}} = \\hat{x} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{x}} + \\hat{y} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{y}} + \\hat{z} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{z}}</math>.\n\n==Lorentz force and analytical mechanics==<!--this section links from [[Momentum#Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation]]-->\n{{see also|Momentum#Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation|l1=Momentum}}\nThe [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for a charged particle of mass ''m'' and charge ''q'' in an electromagnetic field equivalently describes the dynamics of the particle in terms of its ''energy'', rather than the force exerted on it.
