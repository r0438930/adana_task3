It connects [[G\u00f6schenen]] with [[Airolo]] and was the first tunnel through the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif]] in order to bypass the [[St Gotthard Pass]]. It is built as one double-track, standard gauge tunnel.<ref name=saw-34>{{cite book | title = Eisenbahnatlas Schweiz | year = 2012 | publisher = Verlag Schweers + Wall GmbH | isbn=978-3-89494-130-7 | page = 34}}</ref> When opened in 1882, the Gotthard Tunnel was the longest tunnel in the world.\n\nThe tunnel rises from the northern portal at G\u00f6schenen ({{convert|1106|m|abbr=on}}) and the highest point ({{convert|1151|m|abbr=on}}) is reached after approximately {{convert|8|km}}. After two more kilometers, the border between the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] and [[Canton of Ticino|Ticino]] is passed; after another {{convert|5|km}}, the tunnel ends at the southern portal near to Airolo ({{convert|1142|m|abbr=on}}). The journey through the tunnel takes about seven to eight minutes by train.

Despite initial difficulties to finance the project, and resulting costs of about 11% over budget, the financing was shared among private and public investors from [[Switzerland]] (20M CHF), [[Italy]] (45M CHF) and the [[German Empire]] (20M CHF). The bidding war between an engineering company from [[Geneva]] and Italy was fought, and finally, the Swiss engineer [[Louis Favre]] won the project with an estimated cost of 2830 Swiss francs per meter. Because of his low bid, and the extra costs during construction, Favre increasingly found himself at odds with Swiss politicians and investors alike.<ref>Tebart A (2013).

Construction was supervised by the Swiss engineer [[Louis Favre]], who suffered a fatal heart attack inside the tunnel in 1879. Construction was difficult due to financial, technical and geological issues, the latter of which led to the death of around 200 workers (the exact number is not known) mainly due to water inrushes; many were also killed by the [[Compressed-air vehicle|compressed air-driven trains]] carrying excavated material out of the tunnel.
