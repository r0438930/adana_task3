This may produce feelings of intense depression, remorse, and high levels of anxiety, or the desire to achieve youthfulness or make drastic changes to their current lifestyle or feel the wish to change past decisions and events.\n\nThe term was coined by [[Elliott Jaques]] in 1965.  More modern research has shown this is not a phase that most middle-aged people actually experience, and some have questioned the existence of this phenomenon.\n\n==Crisis vs. stressors==\nAcademic research since the 1980s rejects the notion of mid-life crisis as a phase that most adults go through.

However, those events could have happened earlier or later in life, making them a \"crisis,\" but not necessarily a mid-life one. In the same study, 15% of middle-aged adults experienced this type of midlife turmoil.

A mid-life crisis could be caused by aging itself, or aging in combination with changes, problems, or regrets over:\n\n*work or [[career]] (or lack of them)\n*spousal relationships (or lack of them)\n*maturation of children (or lack of children)\n*aging or death of parents\n*physical changes associated with aging\n\nMid-life crisis can affect men and women differently because their stressors differ. An American cultural stereotype of a man going through a midlife crisis may include the purchase of a luxury item such as an exotic car, or seeking [[intimacy]] with a younger woman. Some men seek younger women who are able to procreate, not necessarily with an intention to produce offspring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why do men go through midlife crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>  A man's midlife crises is more likely to be caused by work issues,<ref name=\"auto4\"/> a woman's crisis by personal evaluations of their roles.

Psychologist Oliver Robinson's research characterizes each decade of life by describing frequent occurrences or situations particular to those age periods. He describes that a crisis can begin in a person's early 20s, when they usually try to map out their whole life. Moreover, the later age period, between 50 and 60, may be a time of illness or even the thought of death.

An example supporting such a theory can be derived from the research conducted by Dr. Susan Krauss Whitbourne. People who changed jobs before their midlife years had a greater sense of [[generativity]] when they reached mid-life. They also experienced a greater sense of [[motivation]] to deviate from stagnation and a desire to help the younger generation thrive. This is a psychological stage proposed by Erik Erikson that describes a normal stage adults go through during their mid-life years.<ref name=\"Online Dictionary\">{{cite web|title=Merriam Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/generativity|website=Merriam-Webster}}</ref>\n\n== Theoretical basis ==\nThe notion of the mid-life crisis began with followers of [[Sigmund Freud]], who thought that during middle age everyone\u2019s thoughts were driven by the fear of impending death.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ask-the-brains-is-the-midlife Scientific American MIND Magazine] February 2009 article titled \"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ask-the-brains-is-the-midlife Ask the Brains: Is the Midlife Crisis a Myth?]\" by David Almeida, professor of human development and family studies at Pennsylvania State University</ref> Although mid-life crisis has lately received more attention in [[popular culture]] than serious research, there are some theoretical constructs supporting the notion. [[Jungian theory]] holds that mid-life is key to [[individuation]], a process of [[self-actualization]] and [[self-awareness]] that contains many potential paradoxes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/individuationprocess.htm | title=The Individuation Process}}</ref> Although [[Carl Jung]] did not describe midlife crisis ''per se'', the mid-life integration of thinking, sensation, feeling, and intuition that he describes could, it seems, lead to confusion about one's life and goals.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Erik Erikson]]'s life stage of generativity versus stagnation also coincides with the idea of a mid-life crisis. Erikson believed that in this stage adults begin to understand the pressure of being committed to improving the lives of generations to come. In this stage a person realizes the inevitability of mortality and the virtue of this stage is the creating of a better world for future generations in order for the human race to grow. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stagnation Stagnation] is the lack of psychological movement or growth. Instead of helping the community a person is barely able to help their own family. Those who experience stagnation do not invest in the growth of themselves or others.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Barbara M.|last1=Newman|first2=Philip R.|last2=Newman|title=Development Through Life|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=512\u201315}}</ref>\n\nSome psychologists{{weasel-inline|date=November 2018}} believe men's mid-life crisis is a psychological reaction to the imminent menopause and end of reproductive career of their spouses.<ref name=\"Online Psychology Page\">{{cite web|title=Why Do Men Go Through a Midlife Crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref> Their [[genes]] may be influencing men to be more attracted to reproductive women, and less attached to their non-reproductive spouses.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSome people have challenged the existence of mid-life crises altogether. One study found that 23% of participants had what they called a \"midlife crisis,\" but in digging deeper, only one-third of those\u20148% of the total\u2014said the crisis was associated with awareness of aging.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>https://oxfordre.com/psychology/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-397</ref>\n\nThe balance (15% of those surveyed) had experienced major life experiences or transitions such as [[divorce]] or loss of a job in middle age and described them as \"midlife crisis.\" While there is no doubt these events can be traumatic\u2014the associated grief reactions can be indistinguishable from [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nCosta and McCrae (1980) found little evidence for an increase in [[neuroticism]] in midlife.  While they did find that some people were likely to experience such crises, these individuals were likely to experience crises in their 20s and 30s, and these experiences were not unique to midlife. Robinson, Rosenberg, and Farrell (1999) re-interviewed (500) men. Looking back over their midlife period, it became evident that while not necessarily entailing crisis, it was a time for re-evaluation.\n\nWrapping up their review of men's mid-life crisis, Alwin and Levenson wrote that \"[...] Given the bulk of the data, it is likely that, for most men, mid-life is a time of achievement and satisfaction. For a certain proportion of men, however, the passage is not at all smooth.\" They found a similar pattern when they reviewed research on what are commonly thought to be triggers for women's mid-life crisis: menopause, children leaving home, the \"sandwich\" of caring for both parents and children. Most women navigated those periods without a traumatic psychological \"crisis.\"\n\nThe enduring popularity of the mid-life crisis concept may be explained by another finding by Robinson et al. As Alwin and Levenson summarize: \"... younger men, now middle-aged [[Baby Boomers]], used the term \"midlife crisis\" to describe nearly any setback, either in their career or family life.\"\n\nLevenson researched the possible existence of a midlife crisis and its implications. Whereas Levenson (1978) found that 80% of middle-aged participants had a crisis, and Ciernia (1985) reported that 70% of men in midlife said they had a crisis (Shek, 1996) others could not replicate those findings including Shek (1996), Kruger (1994),  McCrae and Costa (1990). The debate of whether or not there is a midlife crisis is being answered through recent research that attempts to balance such factors as response bias and experimenter effects in order to establish internal validity. The above mentioned research does not support Levenson's model of a single age in the middle years that is a designated time of transition and potential \"crisis.\" Instead, changes in personality can occur throughout the adult years with no peak in general distress or psychosocial crisis.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newpassages00gail|url-access=registration|title=New Passages: Mapping Your Life Across Time|first=Gail|last=Sheehy|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Ballantine Books|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780345404459}}</ref>\n\nMany view mid-life as a negative, but in reality many experience this time positively.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If looked at as a time of personal growth, the experience can be greatly beneficial and rewarding.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If treated as a transitional phase,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> psychologists believe the initial experience may be difficult and confusing but as time passes it becomes an experience of self growth and self-realization.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Chandra|first=Prabha|title=Is midlife crisis for real?|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=7&hid=15&sid=3b299085-01b8-48da-b217-775619bbcedf%40sessionmgr13&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=61440319|newspaper=Prevention India|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>Erikson, Erik H.

Those who experience stagnation do not invest in the growth of themselves or others.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Barbara M.|last1=Newman|first2=Philip R.|last2=Newman|title=Development Through Life|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=512\u201315}}</ref>\n\nSome psychologists{{weasel-inline|date=November 2018}} believe men's mid-life crisis is a psychological reaction to the imminent menopause and end of reproductive career of their spouses.<ref name=\"Online Psychology Page\">{{cite web|title=Why Do Men Go Through a Midlife Crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref> Their [[genes]] may be influencing men to be more attracted to reproductive women, and less attached to their non-reproductive spouses.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSome people have challenged the existence of mid-life crises altogether. One study found that 23% of participants had what they called a \"midlife crisis,\" but in digging deeper, only one-third of those\u20148% of the total\u2014said the crisis was associated with awareness of aging.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>https://oxfordre.com/psychology/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-397</ref>\n\nThe balance (15% of those surveyed) had experienced major life experiences or transitions such as [[divorce]] or loss of a job in middle age and described them as \"midlife crisis.\" While there is no doubt these events can be traumatic\u2014the associated grief reactions can be indistinguishable from [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nCosta and McCrae (1980) found little evidence for an increase in [[neuroticism]] in midlife.  While they did find that some people were likely to experience such crises, these individuals were likely to experience crises in their 20s and 30s, and these experiences were not unique to midlife. Robinson, Rosenberg, and Farrell (1999) re-interviewed (500) men. Looking back over their midlife period, it became evident that while not necessarily entailing crisis, it was a time for re-evaluation.\n\nWrapping up their review of men's mid-life crisis, Alwin and Levenson wrote that \"[...] Given the bulk of the data, it is likely that, for most men, mid-life is a time of achievement and satisfaction. For a certain proportion of men, however, the passage is not at all smooth.\" They found a similar pattern when they reviewed research on what are commonly thought to be triggers for women's mid-life crisis: menopause, children leaving home, the \"sandwich\" of caring for both parents and children. Most women navigated those periods without a traumatic psychological \"crisis.\"\n\nThe enduring popularity of the mid-life crisis concept may be explained by another finding by Robinson et al. As Alwin and Levenson summarize: \"... younger men, now middle-aged [[Baby Boomers]], used the term \"midlife crisis\" to describe nearly any setback, either in their career or family life.\"\n\nLevenson researched the possible existence of a midlife crisis and its implications. Whereas Levenson (1978) found that 80% of middle-aged participants had a crisis, and Ciernia (1985) reported that 70% of men in midlife said they had a crisis (Shek, 1996) others could not replicate those findings including Shek (1996), Kruger (1994),  McCrae and Costa (1990). The debate of whether or not there is a midlife crisis is being answered through recent research that attempts to balance such factors as response bias and experimenter effects in order to establish internal validity. The above mentioned research does not support Levenson's model of a single age in the middle years that is a designated time of transition and potential \"crisis.\" Instead, changes in personality can occur throughout the adult years with no peak in general distress or psychosocial crisis.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newpassages00gail|url-access=registration|title=New Passages: Mapping Your Life Across Time|first=Gail|last=Sheehy|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Ballantine Books|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780345404459}}</ref>\n\nMany view mid-life as a negative, but in reality many experience this time positively.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If looked at as a time of personal growth, the experience can be greatly beneficial and rewarding.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If treated as a transitional phase,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> psychologists believe the initial experience may be difficult and confusing but as time passes it becomes an experience of self growth and self-realization.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Chandra|first=Prabha|title=Is midlife crisis for real?|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=7&hid=15&sid=3b299085-01b8-48da-b217-775619bbcedf%40sessionmgr13&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=61440319|newspaper=Prevention India|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>Erikson, Erik H.
