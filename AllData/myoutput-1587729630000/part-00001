Ted Ts'o and Abutalib Aghayev gave a talk in 2017 on the topic. Seagate also has a more radical \"SMRFFS\" extension from 2015 that makes use of the ZBC/ZAC commands.<ref>{{cite web |title=Seagate/SMR_FS-EXT4: an addition to the popular EXT4 to enable support for devices that use the ZBC or ZAC standards |url=https://github.com/Seagate/SMR_FS-EXT4 |publisher=Seagate Technology |date=10 December 2019}}</ref>\n* For other filesystems, the Linux device mapper has a ''dm-zoned'' target that maps a host-managed drive into a random-writable drive. Linux kernel since 4.10 can perform this task without ''dm''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Device Mapper |url=https://zonedstorage.io/linux/dm |website=ZonedStorage.io}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Linux, [[FreeBSD]] also has command-level support for host-managed SMR drives.<ref>{{man|8|zonectl|FreeBSD}}</ref> {{As of|2020|04}}, neither Windows nor macOS supports the ZBC/ZAC commands required for such drives to work.\n\n===Dynamic hybrid SMR===\nWhile for traditional SMR models each zone is assigned a type at manufacture time, dynamic hybrid SMR drives allow to reconfigure the zone type from shingled to conventional and back by the customer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.westerndigital.com/dynamic-hybrid-smr/|title=Dynamic Hybrid SMR|last=Collins|first=Brendan|date=13 November 2017|publisher=Western Digital|accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/dynamic-hybrid-smr-ocp-proposal-improve-data-center-disk-drives/|title=Dynamic Hybrid-SMR: an OCP proposal to improve data center disk drives|date=13 November 2017|website=blog.google|publisher=Google|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> Adjusting the SMR/CMR setting helps suit the drive to the current workload of \"hot\" and \"cold\" data.<ref name=fast16/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Heat-assisted magnetic recording]] (HAMR)\n* [[Patterned media]]\n* [[Two-dimensional magnetic recording]]\n* [[Log-structured file system]], a type of file system optimized for append-only media\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://lwn.net/Articles/548116/ LSFMM: A storage technology update], [[LWN.net]], April 23, 2013, by Jonathan Corbet\n* [https://events.static.linuxfound.org/sites/events/files/slides/SMR-LinuxConUSA-2014.pdf SMR Impact on Linux Storage Subsystem], HGST, 2014, by Jorge Campello and Adam Manzanares\n* [http://xfs.org/images/f/f6/Xfs-smr-structure-0.2.pdf Layout optimisation for using XFS on host-managed SMR drives], March 2015\n* [https://events.static.linuxfound.org/sites/events/files/slides/SMR%20in%20Linux%20Systems%20-%20Vault.pdf SMR in Linux Systems], Seagate, March 18, 2015, by Adrian Palmer\n* [http://open-zfs.org/w/images/2/2a/Host-Aware_SMR-Tim_Feldman.pdf Host-Aware SMR], Seagate, November 10, 2014, by Timothy Feldman\n[[Category:Computer storage technologies]]\n[[Category:Hard disk drives]]\n", "name_user": "Artoria2e5", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSoftware and application", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingled_magnetic_recording"}
