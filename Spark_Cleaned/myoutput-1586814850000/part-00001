He flew [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bomber from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|''S\u014dry\u016b'']] during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[Indian Ocean Raid]] and the [[Battle of Midway]]. He was shot down during the [[Solomon Islands Campaign]] while flying from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']] but survived the crash and was eventually evacuated to Japan.\n\n==Early career==\nJ\u016bz\u014d Mori was born in on 9 February 1917 in a small town in [[Saitama Prefecture]] to a poor farmer family. He wanted to become a teacher but the family could not afford the entrance fee for the school. He then moved to [[Tokyo]] to live with his uncle. He found him a job in the department store, while at the same time he attended a night school. However, in January 1935 his father died and he was forced to return to his home town in order to support the family. In August he noticed a navy recruiting poster and decided to join the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. He passed the entrance test in January 1936 but almost failed the physical exam as his chest measurement was to small. He enlisted the navy as a navy and in June left for [[Yokosuka]] naval base to start the basic training. In November he transferred to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near [[Tokyo]] to begin pilot training. He graduated from the 38th class in 1938 and specialized for torpedo bombing.\n\nIn April 1938, Mori was assigned to the 12th Air Group based near [[Nanjing]] in [[Central China]]. He flew [[Aichi D1A]] bomber and participated in various operations along [[Yangtze River]]. In September, the unit transitioned to the new [[Nakajima B5N]] bombers. During one of the September mission on near [[Jiujiang]], Mori experienced an engine failure in the new aircraft and was forced to land in a nearby field controlled by [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. In November, while flying a mission from [[Hankou]], his B5N ran out of fuel due to a problem and he again was forced to land in a field near [[Yangtze River]]. This time he and his crew ended up in enemy territory but they were rescued the next day. He left China in December 1938 and in January 1939 he was transferred back to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] NAS to serve as an instructor. In May he was promoted to [[Petty Officer Third Class]].\n\nIn September 1941 he was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]'' and started the training in preparation for the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].\n\n==Pacific War==\nDuring the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Petty Officer Mori was part of the first wave. As his division of [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers they reached the harbor they lined up to attack the [[United States Navy]] (USN) battleship row. However, his division leader lined them up on a cruiser instead of a battleship. Mori realized the error before relasing the torpedo and and went around for another pass. He then lined up on a battleship [[USS California (BB-44)|California]] and hit it with his torpedo.\n\nPetty Officer Mori was not directly involved in the [[Attack on Darwin]] since he was assigned to a patrol duty in the vicinity of INJ carriers.\n\nOn the return journey from Pearl Harbor, the Second Carrier Division (consisting of carriers ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|Hiry\u016b]]'' and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]'') was detached to assist in [[Battle of Wake Island|capturing]] of [[Wake Island]]. On 22 December, Petty Officer Mori and his group of B5N level bombers attacked artillery emplacements and fortifications on the island. The next day, they flew again to support the landings on the islands. When he arrived to the island, the defence already garrison surrendered as he noticed the white flag flying above their headquarters. However, while flying around the islands, one of the rouge AA emplacements opened fire and hit his fuel tank. Infuriated about it, he considered doping the remaining bombs on their position, however, he decided not risk running out of fuel and returned to the IJN fleet instead.\n\nIn April 1942, Petty Officer Mori participated in [[Indian Ocean Raid]]. He was not directly involved in actions on 5 April as he was part of a reserve force waiting on the carriers. However, on 9 April he was part of strike against [[Trincomalee]] military harbor on [[Ceylon]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb and his division performed a low-level bombing attack on hrabor installation. On their back, they encountered a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and evaded it by hiding into a cloud before safely returning to the carrier.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942, Petty Officer Mori was part of the strike force against the USN airfield and installations on [[Midway Atoll]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb for level bombing. On the way to the atoll, they were intercepted by a large group of Midway-based [[United States Marines|Marine]] fighters (six [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s and 20 [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]]s) led by Major [[Floyd B. Parks]]. His aircraft was attacked by the Marine fighters, however the escorting [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s drove them away. Mori and his division of six level bombers attacked the Midway airfield. Four bombs landed and detonated on the runway, while two of them missed and hit the forest nearby. However, those two bombs appeared to have hit AA emplacement and ammo depot, since they cause a series of secondary explosions. After the attack he headed back to IJN fleet where he witnessed the unsuccessful attack on IJN carriers by the Midway-based [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] high-altitude bombers on [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiry\u016b'']] and [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] torpedo bombers on ''S\u014dry\u016b''. He landed on ''S\u014dry\u016b'', which was preparing its [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers for a strike against USN carrier detected in the North-East. However, before the preparation could be finished, ''S\u014dry\u016b'' was hit and set her ablaze by three bombs dropped by dive bombers of [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']] led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Max Leslie]]. Mori was in the ready room at the time of attack and had to fight through the smoke and fire to reach the deck of the carrier. As the fires intensified, he had to jump 60 from the deck into the sea and was eventually picked up by destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Makigumo (1941)|Makigumo]].\n\nAfter the Battle of Midway, Petty Officer Mori was transferred to the new carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']], which sailed from Japan to Guadalcanal in early October 1942. On 16 October, He participated in the hastily organized and ill-fated air strike to attack enemy position around [[Lunga Point]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. The strike consisted of 18 B5N bombers (equipped with 800 kilogram bombs) and 18 Zero fighters, under over all command of Lieutenant Commander [[Yoshio Shiga]]. [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiy\u014d|''Hiy\u014d'']] bombers were led by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Irikiin, while ''Jun'y\u014d'' bombers were led by inexperienced Lieutenant Tadao It\u014d. As they approached Lunga Point, It\u014d broke off the bombing run of the entire ''Jun'y\u014d'' group in order to make another attempt, which infuriated Mori. During the second attempt the group was ambushed by numerous Wildcat fighters from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. In the attack three ''Hiy\u014d'' bombers were shot down and three were damaged, while six ''Jun'y\u014d'' bombers were shot down and 2 were damaged. The escorting Zeros claimed several Wildcats, however ''Hiy\u014d'' ace [[Kaname Harada]] was wounded and had to ditch at [[Rekata Bay]]. Petty Officer Mori lost his right hand and was forced to ditch his bomber in the water near [[Cape Esperance]]. He then endured starvation on [[Guadalcanal]] before being evacuated to [[Truk]] in November.\n\n==Later life==\nAs a result of the injury, Mori was discharged from the navy and survived the war. He later opened a bar near [[Nishi-Ogikubo Station]] in Tokyo, where he also worked as the bartender.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n* {{cite book \n |last=\u68ee\n |first=\u62fe\u4e09\n |year=2004\n |edition=new\n |language=Japanese\n |title=\u5947\u8e5f\u306e\u96f7\u6483\u968a\u2015\u3042\u308b\u96f7\u6483\u6a5f\u64cd\u7e26\u54e1\u306e\u751f\u9084\n |publisher=\u5149\u4eba\u793e\n |location= \n |isbn=476982064X\n}}\n\n* {{cite book \n |last=Mori\n |first=J\u016bz\u014d\n |year=2015\n |translator= Nicholas Voge\n |title=The Miraculous Torpedo Squadron\n |publisher=\n |location= \n |isbn=\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mori, J\u016bz\u014d}}\n[[Category:1917 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox military person\n|name= J\u016bz\u014d Mori\n|birth_date={{Birth date|df=y|1917|2|9}}\n|death_date=\n|birth_place=[[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Petty Officer]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12th Air Group<br/>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]''<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]<br/>[[Indian Ocean Raid]]<br/>[[Battle of Midway]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Mori}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''J\u016bz\u014d Mori'''|\u68ee \u62fe\u4e09|Mori J\u016bz\u014d|}} was a [[torpedo bomber]] pilot in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].
