It received much of its present form. In 1866 the presence of Whose Berger in Feldkirch ends. Since that time, the castle changed its owners frequently. By 1899, the mayor Heinrich Rinderle was in the possession of the castle. He generously distributed the property to the farmers of the community. In 1960, a comprehensive restoration of the Martin Church was completed. In 1964 Feldkirch celebrated the construction of Wessenberg school.
