Originally, it used a 4.0&nbsp;L {{convert|240|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Rover V8 engine|Rover V8]] engine, but that could be optionally increased to 4.3&nbsp;L {{convert|280|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}  in 1992 with a further option of big-valve cylinder heads. In 1993, with a TVR-developed 5.0&nbsp;L {{convert|340|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version of the Rover V8 became available. All versions of the Griffith use the [[Lucas 14CUX]] engine management system. All models use a five-speed manual transmission.\n\nAlthough the Griffith was almost mechanically identical to its sister car, the [[TVR Chimaera|Chimaera]], it had a different body design and was produced in much smaller numbers. <ref name=\"prod\"/>\n\nThe Griffith was a lightweight, high-power, and well-balanced car. A low-cost speed six Griffith proposal never became a production reality; by the time it was launched alongside the Griffith in 1999, it had morphed into the [[TVR Tuscan Speed Six|Tuscan Speed Six]].\n\nA special edition Griffith 500 was made dubbed the '''Blackpool B340'''. This car was featured in [[Gran Turismo (1997 video game)|Gran Turismo]] and [[Gran Turismo 2]] (in the former as the Griffith 4.0 in the NTSC and PAL versions). The car was similar to a normal Griffith 500 with some bespoke options available.\n\nIn 2000, TVR announced that the Griffith production was going to end. A limited edition run of 100 Special Edition (SE) cars were to be built to mark the end of production. Although still very similar to the previous Griffith 500 model, the SE had a hybrid interior using the Chimaera dashboard and Cerbera seats. Noticeably, the rear lights were different along with different door mirrors, higher powered headlights and clear indicator lenses. Some also came with 16-inch wheels. Each car came with a numbered plaque in the glove box including the build number and a Special Edition Badge on its boot. All cars also had a unique signature in the boot under the carpet.

It features a [[Cosworth]] modified [[Ford Modular engine#5.0 L Coyote|Ford Coyote 5.0-litre]] [[V8 engine]] producing {{convert|500|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}, double wishbone suspension with adjustable coilover dampers, a [[carbon fibre]] [[Ground effect (cars)|ground effect]] chassis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPy92eteMgc|title=New TVR Launch at Goodwood Revival 2017|accessdate=8 September 2017}}</ref>. It can accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in approximately 4 seconds and can achieve a top speed in excess of {{convert|322|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The new Griffith retains the manual transmission as used in the previous TVR models making it a proper driver's car but includes [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[power steering]] and [[traction control]] as standard in order to handle the high power output and keep the car stable at high speeds. The extensive use of carbon fibre helps save weight and as a result, it weighs less than {{convert|1250|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} with a 50:50 [[weight distribution]] achieved through the Griffith's architecture of aluminum and carbon fibre components which improves handling. Design elements such as large front air intakes, front splitter and rear integrated diffuser help in increasing aero dynamics while the double side exhausts and a double bubble roof add to the car's purposeful look. Inside the car, a driver-focused setup is kept in mind with a digital instrument cluster providing useful information and minimum controls present on the steering wheel and dashboard. Air conditioning, leather interior trim and multimedia system come as standard as well. The Griffith was expected to start production in 2019 with an initial run of 500 Launch Edition (LE) cars and a price tag of \u20a489,995. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvr.co.uk/new-car|title=TVR Griffith|publisher=TVR|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> The launch date is now early to mid-2020 due to European Union regulations.

Each car came with a numbered plaque in the glove box including the build number and a Special Edition Badge on its boot. All cars also had a unique signature in the boot under the carpet. The SEs were built between 2000 and 2002, with the last registered in 2003.\n\nEvery year, to celebrate the TVR Griffith, their owners have a meet called \"The Griff Growl.\"<ref>[http://www.thegriffithpages.com/news/latest/the-griffith-growl-v-2007.html/The Griff Growl]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:TVR Griffith 2.jpg|thumb|TVR Griffith 2]]\nIn 2008, Al Melling Sports Cars unveiled the [[Melling Wildcat]], a roadster heavily based on the Griffith but powered by a variant of TVR's later [[AJP8]] engine.\n\n=== Specifications ===\n\n'''Engine'''\n\nName: Rover alloy V8\n\nValvetrain setup: 2 valves per cylinder, Overhead Valve\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Model\n!

It features a [[Cosworth]] modified [[Ford Modular engine#5.0 L Coyote|Ford Coyote 5.0-litre]] [[V8 engine]] producing {{convert|500|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}, double wishbone suspension with adjustable coilover dampers, a [[carbon fibre]] [[Ground effect (cars)|ground effect]] chassis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPy92eteMgc|title=New TVR Launch at Goodwood Revival 2017|accessdate=8 September 2017}}</ref>. It can accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} in approximately 4 seconds and can achieve a top speed in excess of {{convert|322|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The new Griffith retains the manual transmission as used in the previous TVR models making it a proper driver's car but includes [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[power steering]] and [[traction control]] as standard in order to handle the high power output and keep the car stable at high speeds. The extensive use of carbon fibre helps save weight and as a result, it weighs less than {{convert|1250|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} with a 50:50 [[weight distribution]] achieved through the Griffith's architecture of aluminum and carbon fibre components which improves handling. Design elements such as large front air intakes, front splitter and rear integrated diffuser help in increasing aero dynamics while the double side exhausts and a double bubble roof add to the car's purposeful look. Inside the car, a driver-focused setup is kept in mind with a digital instrument cluster providing useful information and minimum controls present on the steering wheel and dashboard. Air conditioning, leather interior trim and multimedia system come as standard as well. The Griffith was expected to start production in 2019 with an initial run of 500 Launch Edition (LE) cars and a price tag of \u20a489,995. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvr.co.uk/new-car|title=TVR Griffith|publisher=TVR|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> The launch date is now early to mid-2020 due to European Union regulations.
