Self-educated, he rose to become a successful copywriter and business owner in [[Cleveland]] and [[Elyria, Ohio]]. In 1912, Anderson had a nervous breakdown that led him to abandon his business and family to become a writer.\n\nAt the time, he moved to [[Chicago]] and was eventually married three additional times. His most enduring work is the short-story sequence ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]],''<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/research/anderson-sherwood-1876-1941-sjpc-01/ Anderson, Sherwood (1876\u20131941) | St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Summary]</ref> which launched his career. Throughout the 1920s, Anderson published several short story collections, novels, memoirs, books of essays, and a book of poetry. Though his books sold reasonably well, ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925), a novel inspired by Anderson's time in [[New Orleans]] during the 1920s, was his only bestseller.\n\n==Early life==\nSherwood Berton Anderson was born on September 13, 1876, in [[Camden, Ohio]], a farming town with a population of around 650 (according to the 1870 census).<ref name=\"Rideout16\">Rideout (2006), 16</ref> He was the third of seven children born to Emma Jane (n\u00e9e Smith) and former [[Union Army|Union]] soldier and harness-maker Irwin McLain Anderson. Considered reasonably well-off financially, Anderson's father was seen as an up-and-comer by his Camden contemporaries,<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> the family left town just before Sherwood's first birthday. Reasons for the departure are uncertain; most biographers note rumors of debts incurred by either Irwin<ref>Schevill (1951), 8</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 12</ref> or his brother Benjamin.<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> The Andersons headed north to [[Caledonia, Ohio|Caledonia]] by way of a brief stay in a village of a few hundred called Independence (now [[Butler, Ohio|Butler]]). Four<ref>Townsend (1987), 3</ref> or five<ref>Rideout (2006), 18</ref> years were spent in Caledonia, years which formed Anderson's earliest memories. This period later inspired his semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Tar: A Midwest Childhood]]'' (1926).<ref name=\"Rideout20\">Rideout (2006), 20. For connection between ''Tar'' and Caledonia, also see Anderson (1942), 14-16</ref> In Caledonia Anderson's father began drinking excessively, which led to financial difficulties, eventually causing the family to leave the town.<ref name=\"Rideout20\" />\n\nWith each move, Irwin Anderson's prospects dimmed; while in Camden he was the proprietor of a successful shop and could employ an assistant, but by the time the Andersons finally settled down in [[Clyde, Ohio]] in 1884, a frontier town, Irwin could only get work as a hired man to harness manufacturers.<ref>Townsend (1987), 4</ref> That job was short-lived, and for the rest of Sherwood Anderson's childhood, his father barely supported the family as an occasional sign-painter and paperhanger, while his mother took in washing to make ends meet.<ref>Howe (1951), 13-14</ref> Partly as a result of these misfortunes, young Sherwood became adept at finding various odd jobs to help his family, earning the nickname \"Jobby.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 34</ref><ref name=\"Townsend14\">Townsend (1987), 14. The chapter about Anderson's early life is called \"Jobby.\"</ref>\n\nThough he was a decent student, Anderson's attendance at school declined as he began picking up work, and he finally left school for good at age 14 after about nine months of high school.<ref name=\"Howe16\">Howe (1951), 16</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 39</ref> From the time he began to cut school to the time he left town, Anderson worked as a \"...newsboy, errand boy, waterboy, cow-driver, stable groom, and perhaps [[printer's devil]], not to mention assistant to Irwin Anderson, Sign Painter...\"<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> in addition to assembling bicycles for the [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore Manufacturing Company]].<ref>Townsend (1987), 25-26</ref> Even in his teens, Anderson's talent for selling was evident, a talent he would later draw on in a successful career in advertising. As a newsboy he was said to have convinced a tired farmer in a saloon to buy two copies of the same evening paper.<ref name=\"Townsend14\"/> With the exception of work, Anderson's childhood resembled that of other boys his age.\n\nIn addition to participating in local events and spending time with his friends, Anderson was a voracious reader. Though there were only a few books in the Anderson home (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and the ''Complete Poems'' of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] among them),<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> the youth read widely by borrowing from the school library (there was not a public library in Clyde until 1903), and the personal libraries of a school superintendent and John Tichenor, a local artist, who responded to Anderson's interest.<ref>Rideout (2006), 37-38. See Anderson (1924), 155-56 for list of authors enjoyed by young Anderson</ref>\n\nBy Anderson's 18th year in 1895, his family was on shaky ground. His father had started to disappear for weeks.<ref>Townsend (1987), 11</ref> Two years earlier, in 1893, Karl, Sherwood's elder brother, had left Clyde for [[Chicago]].<ref>Spanierman Gallery, LLC. [http://www.spanierman.com/Anderson,-Karl/bio/thumbs/biography KARL ANDERSON (1874 - 1956)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530064502/http://www.spanierman.com/Anderson,-Karl/bio/thumbs/biography |date=May 30, 2013 }}. Accessed 26 May 2013.</ref> On May 10, 1895, his mother succumbed to [[tuberculosis]]. Sherwood, now essentially on his own, boarded at the Harvey & Yetter's livery stable where he worked as a groom\u2014an experience that would translate into several of his best-known stories.<ref>Townsend (1987), 28</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 59-61</ref> (Irwin Anderson died in 1919 after having been estranged from his son for two decades.)<ref name=\"Townsend30\">Townsend (1987), 30</ref> Two months before his mother's death, in March 1895, Anderson had signed up with the [[Ohio National Guard]] for a five-year hitch<ref>Rideout (2006), 50</ref> while he was going steady with Bertha Baynes, an attractive girl and possibly the inspiration for Helen White in ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'',<ref>Rideout (2006), 47</ref> and he was working a secure job at the bicycle factory. But his mother's death precipitated the young man's leaving Clyde.<ref name=\"Townsend30\"/> He settled in [[Chicago]] around late 1896<ref>Townsend (1987), 31</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 27</ref> or spring/summer 1897, having worked a few small-town factory jobs along the way.<ref>Rideout (2006), 69-71</ref>\n\n==Chicago and war==\nAnderson moved to a boardinghouse in Chicago owned by a former mayor of Clyde. His brother Karl lived in the city and was studying at the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]]. Anderson moved in with him and quickly found a job at a cold-storage plant.<ref>Townsend (1987), 33</ref> In late 1897, Karl moved away, and Anderson relocated to a two-room flat with his sister and two younger brothers newly come from Clyde.<ref>Townsend (1987), 34</ref> Money was tight\u2014Anderson earned \"two dollars for a day of ten hours\"\u2014<ref>Anderson (1942), 112</ref> but with occasional support from Karl, they got by. Following the example of his Clyde confederate and lifelong friend Cliff Paden (later to become known as [[John Emerson (filmmaker)|John Emerson]]) and Karl, Anderson took up the idea of furthering his education by enrolling in night school at the [[Lewis Institute#Lewis Institute|Lewis Institute]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\">Rideout (2006), 73\u201374</ref> He attended several classes regularly including \"New Business Arithmetic\" earning marks that placed him second in the class.<ref>Townsend (1987), 36</ref> It was also there that Anderson heard lectures on [[Robert Browning]], Alfred Tennyson, and was possibly first introduced to the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\" /> Soon, however, Anderson's first stint in Chicago would come to an end as the United States prepared to enter the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\nAlthough he had limited resources while in Chicago, Anderson bought a new suit and returned to Clyde to join the military.<ref>Townsend (1987), 38</ref> Once home, the company he joined mustered into the army at Camp Bushnell, Ohio on May 12, 1898.<ref>Rideout (2006), 78</ref> Several months of training followed at various southern encampments until early in 1899, when his company was sent to [[Cuba]]. Fighting had ceased four months prior to their arrival. On April 21, 1899, they left Cuba having seen no combat.<ref>Townsend (1987), 39\u201341</ref> According to Irving Howe, \"Sherwood was popular among his army comrades, who remembered him as a fellow given to prolonged reading, mostly in dime westerns and historical romances, and talented at finding a girl when he wanted one. For the first of these traits he was frequently teased, but the second brought him the respect it usually does in armies.\"<ref>Howe (1951), 29</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Anderson resided briefly in Clyde performing agricultural work before deciding to return to school.<ref>Townsend (1987), 41</ref> In September 1899 Anderson joined his siblings Karl and Stella in [[Springfield, Ohio]] where, at the age of twenty-three he enrolled for his senior year of preparatory school at the Wittenberg Academy, a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] located on the campus of the [[Wittenberg University]]. In his time there he performed well, earning good marks and participating in several extracurricular activities. In the spring of 1900 Anderson graduated from the Academy, offering a discourse on [[Zionism]] as one of the eight students chosen to give a commencement speech.<ref name=\"Howe3132\">Howe (1951), 31\u201332</ref>\n\n==Business, marriage and family==\nDuring his time in Springfield, Anderson stayed and worked as a \"chore boy\" in a boardinghouse called The Oaks among a group of businessmen, educators, and other creatives types many of whom became friendly with the young Anderson.<ref name=\"Howe3132\"/> In particular, a high school teacher named Trillena White and a businessman Harry Simmons played a role in the author's life. The former who was ten years Anderson's senior would walk\u2014raising eyebrows among the other boarders\u2014with the young man in the evenings. More importantly, according to Anderson, she \"first introduced me to fine literature\"<ref>Anderson (1984), 227\u2013228</ref> and would later serve as inspiration for a number of his characters including the teacher Kate Swift in ''Winesburg, Ohio''.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\">Townsend (1987), 42\u201343</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 226</ref> The latter, who worked as the advertising manager for Mast, Crowell, and Kirkpatrick (later Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, publishers of the ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'') and occasionally took meals at The Oaks, was so impressed by Anderson's commencement speech that he offered him a job on the spot as an advertising solicitor at his company's Chicago office.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\"/> Thus, in the summer of 1900, Anderson returned to Chicago where most of his siblings were now living, intent on achieving success in his new white-collar occupation.<ref>Rideout (2006), 92\u201393</ref>\n\nThough he performed well, problems with his boss and a dislike for the office routine and for the style of correspondence, which caused the ultimate rift, caused Anderson to leave Crowell in mid-1901 for a position set up for him by Marco Marrow, another friend from The Oaks, at the Frank B. White Advertising Company (later the Long-Critchfield Agency).<ref>Daugherty (1948), 31</ref> There the author stayed until 1906, selling ads and writing advertising copy for manufacturers of farming implements and articles for the trade journal, ''Agricultural Advertising''.<ref>See Rideout (2006), 95\u2013110 &amp; Anderson (1989) for analysis and the collected early work, respectively</ref> In this latter magazine Anderson published his first professional work, a February 1902 piece called \"The Farmer Wears Clothes.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 95</ref> What followed were approximately 29 articles and essays for his company's magazine, and two for a small literary magazine published by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] called ''The Reader''.<ref>Campbell, Hilbert H (Summer 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/early.html The Early non-Journal Writings]\". ''The Sherwood Anderson Review'' '''23''' (2).</ref> According to scholar Welford Dunaway Taylor, the two monthly columns (\"Rot and Reason\" and \"Business Types\") Anderson wrote for ''Agricultural Advertising'' exemplified the \"character writing\" (or [[character sketch]]es) that would later become a notable part of the author's approach in ''Winesburg, Ohio'' and other works.<ref>Taylor, Welford Dunaway (Winter 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/wd.html Remembered \"Characters\" in ''Winesburg, Ohio'']\".

On one of these trips around May 1903 he stopped in the home of a friend from Clyde, Jane \"Jennie\" Bemis, then living in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. It was there that he met Cornelia Pratt Lane (1877\u20131967), the daughter of wealthy Ohio businessman Robert Lane. The two were married a year later, on the 16th of May, in [[Lucas, Ohio]].<ref>Ohio,\n County Marriages, 1774-1993</ref> They would go on to have three children\u2014Robert Lane (1907\u20131951), John Sherwood (1908\u20131995), and Marion (aka Mimi, 1911\u20131996).<ref>Rideout (2006), 112\u2013114</ref> After a short honeymoon, the couple moved into an apartment on the [[South Side, Chicago|south side of Chicago]].<ref>A copy of Sherwood Anderson's honeymoon journal is available in the ''[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/98summer.html Sherwood Anderson Review]'' (Summer 1998)</ref> For two additional years, Anderson worked for Long-Critchfield until an opportunity came along from one of the accounts he managed and so on [[Labor Day]] 1906, Sherwood Anderson left Chicago for [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to become president of United Factories Company, a mail-order firm selling various items from surrounding firms.<ref>Rideout (2006), 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nWhile his new job, which amounted to the position of sales manager, could be stressful<ref name=\":0\">Townsend (1987), 59\u201360</ref> the happy home life Cornelia had fostered in Chicago continued in Cleveland; \"his wife and he entertained frequently. They went to church on Sundays, with Anderson decked out in morning clothes and top hat. On occasional Sunday afternoons Cornelia taught him French. She also helped with his advertising work.\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 45</ref> Unfortunately, his home life could not sustain him when one of the manufacturers United Factories marketed produced a large batch of defective [[Incubators (egg)|incubators]]. Soon, letters addressed to Anderson (who personally guaranteed all products sold) began to arrive from customers both desperate and angry. The strain from months of answering hundreds of these letters while continuing his demanding schedule at work and home led to a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1907 and eventually his departure from the company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 126\u2013128</ref>\n\nHis failure in Cleveland did not delay him for long, however, because in September 1907, the Andersons moved to Elyria, Ohio, a town of approximately ten thousand residents, where he rented a warehouse within sight of the railroad and began a mail-order business selling (at a markup of 500%) a preservative paint called \"Roof-Fix.\"<ref>Daugherty (1948), 33</ref> The first years in Elyria went very well for Anderson and his family; two more children were added for a total of three in addition to a busy social life for their parents.<ref>Howe (1951), 41\u201342</ref> So well, in fact, did the Anderson Manufacturing Co. do that Anderson was able to purchase and absorb several similar businesses and expand his firm's product-lines under the name Anderson Paint Company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 134</ref> Carrying on that momentum, in late 1911 Anderson secured the financial backing to merge his companies into the American Merchants Company, a profit-sharing/investment firm operating in part on a scheme he developed around that time called \"Commercial Democracy.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 137\u2013138</ref><ref>Sutton (1967), 9\u201312</ref>\n\n==Nervous breakdown==\nIt was then, at what seemed the pinnacle of his business achievements, when the stresses of Anderson's professional life collided with his social responsibilities and his writing, that Anderson suffered the breakdown that has remained paramount in the \"myth\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 55</ref> or \"legend\"<ref name=\"Howe49\">Howe (1951), 49</ref><ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\">White (1972), xii\u2013xiv</ref> of Sherwood Anderson's life.<ref>Rideout (2006), 149\u2013155</ref>\n\nOn Thursday, November 28, 1912, Anderson came to his office in a slightly nervous state. According to his secretary, he opened some mail, and in the course of dictating a business letter became distracted. After writing a note to his wife, he murmured something along the lines of \"I feel as though my feet were wet, and they keep getting wetter.\"<ref group=\"note\">The quote above comes from the Frances Shute, Anderson's secretary at the time, as cited in Rideout (2006), 155. In Anderson (1924), it was remembered as \"I have been wading in a long river and my feet are wet. My feet are cold, wet and heavy from long wading in a river. Now I shall go walk on dry land,\" whereas in Anderson (1942), it was \"My feet are cold and wet. I have been walking too long on the bed of a river.\"</ref> and left the office. Four days later, on Sunday December 1, a disoriented Anderson entered a drug store on East 152nd Street in Cleveland and asked the pharmacist to help figure out his identity. Unable to make out what the incoherent Anderson was saying, the pharmacist discovered a phone book on his person and called the number of Edwin Baxter, a member of the Elyria Chamber of Commerce. Baxter came, recognized Anderson, and promptly had him checked into the Huron Road Hospital in downtown Cleveland, where Anderson's wife, who he would hardly recognize, went to meet him.<ref>Most Anderson's biographers agree on the events included here. For a general sense, see Rideout (2006), 155\u2013156; Schevill (1951), 52\u201359; Townsend (1987), 76\u201382.</ref>\n\nBut even before returning home, Anderson began his lifelong practice of reinterpreting the story of his breakdown. Despite news reports in the ''Elyria Evening Telegram'' and the ''Cleveland Press'' following his admittance into the hospital that ascribed the cause of the breakdown to \"overwork\" and that mentioned Anderson's inability to remember what happened,<ref>See issues of December 2nd and 3rd for the former and December 3rd for the latter</ref> on December 6 the story changed. All of a sudden, the breakdown became voluntary. The ''Evening Telegram'' reported (possibly spuriously)<ref>Sutton (1967), 43\u201344</ref> that \"As soon as he recovers from the trance into which he placed himself, Sherwood Anderson ... will write a book of the sensations he experienced while he wandered over the country as a nomad.\"<ref>''Elyria Evening Telegram''(06 December 1912) as quoted in Schevill (1951), 59</ref> This same sense of personal agency is alluded to thirty years later in ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs'' (1942) where the author wrote of his thought process before walking out: \"I wanted to leave, get away from business. ... Again I resorted to slickness, to craftiness...The thought occurred to me that if men thought me a little insane they would forgive me if I lit out....\"<ref>Anderson (1942), 194</ref> This idea, however, that Anderson made a conscious decision on November 28 to make a clean break from family and business is unlikely.<ref name=\"Howe49\"/><ref>Sutton (1967), 12</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 157</ref> In the first place, contrary to what Anderson later claimed, his writing was no secret. It was known to his wife, secretary, and some business associates that for several years Anderson had been working on personal writing projects both at night and occasionally in his office at the factory.<ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\"/> Secondly, although some of the notes he wrote were to himself during his journey, notes he mailed to his wife on Saturday, addressing the envelope \"Cornelia L. Anderson, Pres., American Striving Co.,\" show that he had some semblance of memory. The general confusion and frequent incoherence the notes exhibit is unlikely to be deliberate.<ref>Sutton (1967), 36\u201339 offers the complete text of the notes with analysis, and several other biographers including Townsend (1987) and Rideout (2006) analyze and print selections.</ref> While diagnoses for the four days of Anderson's wanderings have ranged from \"[[amnesia]]\" to \"lost identity\" to \"[[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]],\" his condition is generally characterized today as a \"[[fugue state]].\"<ref>Townsend (1987), 81</ref><ref>Sperber, Michael (05 June 2013). \"[Dissociative Amnesia (Psychogenic Fugue) and a Literary Masterpiece http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychogenic-fugue-literature]\" ''Psychiatric Times''.

Later, he married his mistress, the sculptor [[Tennessee Claflin Mitchell]] (1874\u20131929).<ref>Bassett (2005), p. 21</ref> Anderson divorced Mitchell in 1924 in [[Reno, Nevada]], and soon the same year married his third wife, Elizabeth Prall, a woman he was already involved with before the divorce.<ref>Anderson, Elizabeth and Gerald R. Kelly (1969). ''Miss Elizabeth''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.</ref>\n\n==Novelist==\nAnderson's first novel, ''[[Windy McPherson's Son]]'', was published in 1916 as part of a three-book deal with [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]]. This book, along with his second novel, ''[[Marching Men]]'' (1917), are usually considered his \"apprentice novels\" because they came before Anderson found fame with ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919) and are generally considered inferior in quality to works that followed.<ref>Howe (1951), 91</ref>\n\nAnderson's most notable work is his collection of interrelated short stories, ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919). In his memoir, he wrote that \"Hands\", the opening story, was the first \"real\" story he ever wrote.<ref>Anderson, Sherwood. ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1942.</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Instead of emphasizing plot and action, Anderson used a simple, precise, unsentimental style to reveal the frustration, loneliness, and longing in the lives of his characters. These characters are stunted by the narrowness of Midwestern small-town life and by their own limitations.\"<ref name=\"fogel\"/></blockquote>In addition, Anderson was one of the first American novelists to introduce new insights from psychology, including [[Freudian analysis]].<ref name=\"fogel\">[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/anderson.html Daniel Mark Fogel,\"Sherwood Anderson\"], ''The American Novel,'' PBS, 2007, accessed 2 June 2013</ref>\n\nAlthough his short stories were very successful, Anderson wanted to write novels, which he felt allowed a larger scale. In 1920, he published ''[[Poor White (novel)|Poor White]]'', which was rather successful. In 1923, Anderson published ''[[Many Marriages]]''; in it he explored the new sexual freedom, a theme which he continued in ''Dark Laughter'' and later writing.<ref name=\"nona\"/> ''Dark Laughter'' had its detractors, but the reviews were, on the whole, positive. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] considered ''Many Marriages'' to be Anderson's finest novel.<ref>Howe, Irving. ''Sherwood Anderson''. New York: William Sloane Associates, 1951. (pg. 254)</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1924, Sherwood and Elizabeth Prall Anderson moved to [[New Orleans]], where they lived in the historic Pontalba Apartments (540-B St. Peter Street) adjoining [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]] in the heart of the [[French Quarter]]. For a time, they entertained [[William Faulkner]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and other writers, for whom Anderson was a major influence. Critics trying to define Anderson's significance have said he was more influential through this younger generation than through his own works.<ref name=\"fogel\"/>\n\nAnderson referred to meeting Faulkner in his ambiguous and moving short story, \"A Meeting South.\" His novel ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925) drew from his New Orleans experiences and continued to explore the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Although the book was satirized by [[Ernest Hemingway]] in his novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'', it was a bestseller at the time, the only book of Anderson's to reach that status during his lifetime.\n\n==Four marriages==\nAnderson and Cornelia Lane married in 1904 and divorced in 1916 after having his only 3 children. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Editors |title=Sherwood Anderson's Biography |url=http://umich.edu/~eng217/student_projects/anderson/biography.htm |website=umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=9 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref>.  \n\nAnderson quickly married Tennessee Claflin Mitchell in 1916 and obtained a divorce [[Reno, Nevada]] in 1924.\n\nThat year Anderson married Elizabeth Norma Prall (1884\u20131976), a friend of Faulkner's whom he had met in New York. After several years that marriage also failed. In 1928 Anderson became involved with [[Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver]] (1896\u20131985).\n\nIn 1933, Anderson and Copenhaver married.<ref>Anderson (1991), pp. 8\u20139</ref> They traveled and often studied together.

In 1935, he was commissioned to go to [[Franklin County, Virginia]] to cover a major federal trial of bootleggers and gangsters, in what was called \"The Great [[Moonshine]] Conspiracy\". More than 30 men had been indicted for trial. In his article, he said Franklin was the \"wettest county in the world,\" a phrase used as a title for a 21st-century novel by [[Matt Bondurant]].<ref name =LJ>{{cite journal| last = Fisher| first = Ann H.| title = The Wettest Country in the World [Review]| journal = Library Journal| date = 7/1/2008| volume = 133| issue = 12| page = 58}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, Anderson published ''[[Death in the Woods]]'' ([[Short story|short stories]]), ''Puzzled America'' (essays), and ''Kit Brandon: A Portrait'' (novel). In 1932, Anderson dedicated his novel ''Beyond Desire'' to Copenhaver. Although by this time he was considered to be less influential overall in American literature, some of what have become his most quoted passages were published in these later works. The books were otherwise considered inferior to his earlier ones.\n\n''Beyond Desire'' built on his interest in the trade union movement and was set during the 1929 [[Loray Mill Strike]] in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. Hemingway referred to it satirically in his novel, ''[[To Have and Have Not]]'' (1937), where he included as a minor character an author working on a novel of Gastonia.\n\nIn his later years, Anderson and Copenhaver lived on his [[Ripshin Farm]] in [[Troutdale, Virginia]], which he purchased in 1927 for use during summers.<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|title=Ripshin Farm|accessdate=2008-04-16|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606154607/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While living there, he contributed to a country newspaper, columns that were collected and published posthumously.<ref>''Return to Winesburg: Selections from Four Years of Writing for a Country Newspaper'', edited by Ray Lewis White (1967)</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Sherwood Anderson's grave marker.jpg|thumb|Anderson's grave marker at Round Hill Cemetery in Marion, Virginia.

Self-educated, he rose to become a successful copywriter and business owner in [[Cleveland]] and [[Elyria, Ohio]]. In 1912, Anderson had a nervous breakdown that led him to abandon his business and family to become a writer.\n\nAt the time, he moved to [[Chicago]] and was eventually married three additional times. His most enduring work is the short-story sequence ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]],''<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/research/anderson-sherwood-1876-1941-sjpc-01/ Anderson, Sherwood (1876\u20131941) | St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Summary]</ref> which launched his career. Throughout the 1920s, Anderson published several short story collections, novels, memoirs, books of essays, and a book of poetry. Though his books sold reasonably well, ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925), a novel inspired by Anderson's time in [[New Orleans]] during the 1920s, was his only bestseller.\n\n==Early life==\nSherwood Berton Anderson was born on September 13, 1876, in [[Camden, Ohio]], a farming town with a population of around 650 (according to the 1870 census).<ref name=\"Rideout16\">Rideout (2006), 16</ref> He was the third of seven children born to Emma Jane (n\u00e9e Smith) and former [[Union Army|Union]] soldier and harness-maker Irwin McLain Anderson. Considered reasonably well-off financially, Anderson's father was seen as an up-and-comer by his Camden contemporaries,<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> the family left town just before Sherwood's first birthday. Reasons for the departure are uncertain; most biographers note rumors of debts incurred by either Irwin<ref>Schevill (1951), 8</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 12</ref> or his brother Benjamin.<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> The Andersons headed north to [[Caledonia, Ohio|Caledonia]] by way of a brief stay in a village of a few hundred called Independence (now [[Butler, Ohio|Butler]]). Four<ref>Townsend (1987), 3</ref> or five<ref>Rideout (2006), 18</ref> years were spent in Caledonia, years which formed Anderson's earliest memories. This period later inspired his semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Tar: A Midwest Childhood]]'' (1926).<ref name=\"Rideout20\">Rideout (2006), 20. For connection between ''Tar'' and Caledonia, also see Anderson (1942), 14-16</ref> In Caledonia Anderson's father began drinking excessively, which led to financial difficulties, eventually causing the family to leave the town.<ref name=\"Rideout20\" />\n\nWith each move, Irwin Anderson's prospects dimmed; while in Camden he was the proprietor of a successful shop and could employ an assistant, but by the time the Andersons finally settled down in [[Clyde, Ohio]] in 1884, a frontier town, Irwin could only get work as a hired man to harness manufacturers.<ref>Townsend (1987), 4</ref> That job was short-lived, and for the rest of Sherwood Anderson's childhood, his father barely supported the family as an occasional sign-painter and paperhanger, while his mother took in washing to make ends meet.<ref>Howe (1951), 13-14</ref> Partly as a result of these misfortunes, young Sherwood became adept at finding various odd jobs to help his family, earning the nickname \"Jobby.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 34</ref><ref name=\"Townsend14\">Townsend (1987), 14. The chapter about Anderson's early life is called \"Jobby.\"</ref>\n\nThough he was a decent student, Anderson's attendance at school declined as he began picking up work, and he finally left school for good at age 14 after about nine months of high school.<ref name=\"Howe16\">Howe (1951), 16</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 39</ref> From the time he began to cut school to the time he left town, Anderson worked as a \"...newsboy, errand boy, waterboy, cow-driver, stable groom, and perhaps [[printer's devil]], not to mention assistant to Irwin Anderson, Sign Painter...\"<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> in addition to assembling bicycles for the [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore Manufacturing Company]].<ref>Townsend (1987), 25-26</ref> Even in his teens, Anderson's talent for selling was evident, a talent he would later draw on in a successful career in advertising. As a newsboy he was said to have convinced a tired farmer in a saloon to buy two copies of the same evening paper.<ref name=\"Townsend14\"/> With the exception of work, Anderson's childhood resembled that of other boys his age.\n\nIn addition to participating in local events and spending time with his friends, Anderson was a voracious reader. Though there were only a few books in the Anderson home (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and the ''Complete Poems'' of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] among them),<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> the youth read widely by borrowing from the school library (there was not a public library in Clyde until 1903), and the personal libraries of a school superintendent and John Tichenor, a local artist, who responded to Anderson's interest.<ref>Rideout (2006), 37-38. See Anderson (1924), 155-56 for list of authors enjoyed by young Anderson</ref>\n\nBy Anderson's 18th year in 1895, his family was on shaky ground. His father had started to disappear for weeks.<ref>Townsend (1987), 11</ref> Two years earlier, in 1893, Karl, Sherwood's elder brother, had left Clyde for [[Chicago]].<ref>Spanierman Gallery, LLC.

Accessed 26 May 2013.</ref> On May 10, 1895, his mother succumbed to [[tuberculosis]]. Sherwood, now essentially on his own, boarded at the Harvey & Yetter's livery stable where he worked as a groom\u2014an experience that would translate into several of his best-known stories.<ref>Townsend (1987), 28</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 59-61</ref> (Irwin Anderson died in 1919 after having been estranged from his son for two decades.)<ref name=\"Townsend30\">Townsend (1987), 30</ref> Two months before his mother's death, in March 1895, Anderson had signed up with the [[Ohio National Guard]] for a five-year hitch<ref>Rideout (2006), 50</ref> while he was going steady with Bertha Baynes, an attractive girl and possibly the inspiration for Helen White in ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'',<ref>Rideout (2006), 47</ref> and he was working a secure job at the bicycle factory. But his mother's death precipitated the young man's leaving Clyde.<ref name=\"Townsend30\"/> He settled in [[Chicago]] around late 1896<ref>Townsend (1987), 31</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 27</ref> or spring/summer 1897, having worked a few small-town factory jobs along the way.<ref>Rideout (2006), 69-71</ref>\n\n==Chicago and war==\nAnderson moved to a boardinghouse in Chicago owned by a former mayor of Clyde. His brother Karl lived in the city and was studying at the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]]. Anderson moved in with him and quickly found a job at a cold-storage plant.<ref>Townsend (1987), 33</ref> In late 1897, Karl moved away, and Anderson relocated to a two-room flat with his sister and two younger brothers newly come from Clyde.<ref>Townsend (1987), 34</ref> Money was tight\u2014Anderson earned \"two dollars for a day of ten hours\"\u2014<ref>Anderson (1942), 112</ref> but with occasional support from Karl, they got by. Following the example of his Clyde confederate and lifelong friend Cliff Paden (later to become known as [[John Emerson (filmmaker)|John Emerson]]) and Karl, Anderson took up the idea of furthering his education by enrolling in night school at the [[Lewis Institute#Lewis Institute|Lewis Institute]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\">Rideout (2006), 73\u201374</ref> He attended several classes regularly including \"New Business Arithmetic\" earning marks that placed him second in the class.<ref>Townsend (1987), 36</ref> It was also there that Anderson heard lectures on [[Robert Browning]], Alfred Tennyson, and was possibly first introduced to the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\" /> Soon, however, Anderson's first stint in Chicago would come to an end as the United States prepared to enter the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\nAlthough he had limited resources while in Chicago, Anderson bought a new suit and returned to Clyde to join the military.<ref>Townsend (1987), 38</ref> Once home, the company he joined mustered into the army at Camp Bushnell, Ohio on May 12, 1898.<ref>Rideout (2006), 78</ref> Several months of training followed at various southern encampments until early in 1899, when his company was sent to [[Cuba]]. Fighting had ceased four months prior to their arrival. On April 21, 1899, they left Cuba having seen no combat.<ref>Townsend (1987), 39\u201341</ref> According to Irving Howe, \"Sherwood was popular among his army comrades, who remembered him as a fellow given to prolonged reading, mostly in dime westerns and historical romances, and talented at finding a girl when he wanted one. For the first of these traits he was frequently teased, but the second brought him the respect it usually does in armies.\"<ref>Howe (1951), 29</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Anderson resided briefly in Clyde performing agricultural work before deciding to return to school.<ref>Townsend (1987), 41</ref> In September 1899 Anderson joined his siblings Karl and Stella in [[Springfield, Ohio]] where, at the age of twenty-three he enrolled for his senior year of preparatory school at the Wittenberg Academy, a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] located on the campus of the [[Wittenberg University]]. In his time there he performed well, earning good marks and participating in several extracurricular activities. In the spring of 1900 Anderson graduated from the Academy, offering a discourse on [[Zionism]] as one of the eight students chosen to give a commencement speech.<ref name=\"Howe3132\">Howe (1951), 31\u201332</ref>\n\n==Business, marriage and family==\nDuring his time in Springfield, Anderson stayed and worked as a \"chore boy\" in a boardinghouse called The Oaks among a group of businessmen, educators, and other creatives types many of whom became friendly with the young Anderson.<ref name=\"Howe3132\"/> In particular, a high school teacher named Trillena White and a businessman Harry Simmons played a role in the author's life. The former who was ten years Anderson's senior would walk\u2014raising eyebrows among the other boarders\u2014with the young man in the evenings. More importantly, according to Anderson, she \"first introduced me to fine literature\"<ref>Anderson (1984), 227\u2013228</ref> and would later serve as inspiration for a number of his characters including the teacher Kate Swift in ''Winesburg, Ohio''.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\">Townsend (1987), 42\u201343</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 226</ref> The latter, who worked as the advertising manager for Mast, Crowell, and Kirkpatrick (later Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, publishers of the ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'') and occasionally took meals at The Oaks, was so impressed by Anderson's commencement speech that he offered him a job on the spot as an advertising solicitor at his company's Chicago office.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\"/> Thus, in the summer of 1900, Anderson returned to Chicago where most of his siblings were now living, intent on achieving success in his new white-collar occupation.<ref>Rideout (2006), 92\u201393</ref>\n\nThough he performed well, problems with his boss and a dislike for the office routine and for the style of correspondence, which caused the ultimate rift, caused Anderson to leave Crowell in mid-1901 for a position set up for him by Marco Marrow, another friend from The Oaks, at the Frank B. White Advertising Company (later the Long-Critchfield Agency).<ref>Daugherty (1948), 31</ref> There the author stayed until 1906, selling ads and writing advertising copy for manufacturers of farming implements and articles for the trade journal, ''Agricultural Advertising''.<ref>See Rideout (2006), 95\u2013110 &amp; Anderson (1989) for analysis and the collected early work, respectively</ref> In this latter magazine Anderson published his first professional work, a February 1902 piece called \"The Farmer Wears Clothes.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 95</ref> What followed were approximately 29 articles and essays for his company's magazine, and two for a small literary magazine published by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] called ''The Reader''.<ref>Campbell, Hilbert H (Summer 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/early.html The Early non-Journal Writings]\". ''The Sherwood Anderson Review'' '''23''' (2).</ref> According to scholar Welford Dunaway Taylor, the two monthly columns (\"Rot and Reason\" and \"Business Types\") Anderson wrote for ''Agricultural Advertising'' exemplified the \"character writing\" (or [[character sketch]]es) that would later become a notable part of the author's approach in ''Winesburg, Ohio'' and other works.<ref>Taylor, Welford Dunaway (Winter 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/wd.html Remembered \"Characters\" in ''Winesburg, Ohio'']\".

On one of these trips around May 1903 he stopped in the home of a friend from Clyde, Jane \"Jennie\" Bemis, then living in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. It was there that he met Cornelia Pratt Lane (1877\u20131967), the daughter of wealthy Ohio businessman Robert Lane. The two were married a year later, on the 16th of May, in [[Lucas, Ohio]].<ref>Ohio,\n County Marriages, 1774-1993</ref> They would go on to have three children\u2014Robert Lane (1907\u20131951), John Sherwood (1908\u20131995), and Marion (aka Mimi, 1911\u20131996).<ref>Rideout (2006), 112\u2013114</ref> After a short honeymoon, the couple moved into an apartment on the [[South Side, Chicago|south side of Chicago]].<ref>A copy of Sherwood Anderson's honeymoon journal is available in the ''[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/98summer.html Sherwood Anderson Review]'' (Summer 1998)</ref> For two additional years, Anderson worked for Long-Critchfield until an opportunity came along from one of the accounts he managed and so on [[Labor Day]] 1906, Sherwood Anderson left Chicago for [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to become president of United Factories Company, a mail-order firm selling various items from surrounding firms.<ref>Rideout (2006), 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nWhile his new job, which amounted to the position of sales manager, could be stressful<ref name=\":0\">Townsend (1987), 59\u201360</ref> the happy home life Cornelia had fostered in Chicago continued in Cleveland; \"his wife and he entertained frequently. They went to church on Sundays, with Anderson decked out in morning clothes and top hat. On occasional Sunday afternoons Cornelia taught him French. She also helped with his advertising work.\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 45</ref> Unfortunately, his home life could not sustain him when one of the manufacturers United Factories marketed produced a large batch of defective [[Incubators (egg)|incubators]]. Soon, letters addressed to Anderson (who personally guaranteed all products sold) began to arrive from customers both desperate and angry. The strain from months of answering hundreds of these letters while continuing his demanding schedule at work and home led to a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1907 and eventually his departure from the company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 126\u2013128</ref>\n\nHis failure in Cleveland did not delay him for long, however, because in September 1907, the Andersons moved to Elyria, Ohio, a town of approximately ten thousand residents, where he rented a warehouse within sight of the railroad and began a mail-order business selling (at a markup of 500%) a preservative paint called \"Roof-Fix.\"<ref>Daugherty (1948), 33</ref> The first years in Elyria went very well for Anderson and his family; two more children were added for a total of three in addition to a busy social life for their parents.<ref>Howe (1951), 41\u201342</ref> So well, in fact, did the Anderson Manufacturing Co. do that Anderson was able to purchase and absorb several similar businesses and expand his firm's product-lines under the name Anderson Paint Company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 134</ref> Carrying on that momentum, in late 1911 Anderson secured the financial backing to merge his companies into the American Merchants Company, a profit-sharing/investment firm operating in part on a scheme he developed around that time called \"Commercial Democracy.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 137\u2013138</ref><ref>Sutton (1967), 9\u201312</ref>\n\n==Nervous breakdown==\nIt was then, at what seemed the pinnacle of his business achievements, when the stresses of Anderson's professional life collided with his social responsibilities and his writing, that Anderson suffered the breakdown that has remained paramount in the \"myth\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 55</ref> or \"legend\"<ref name=\"Howe49\">Howe (1951), 49</ref><ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\">White (1972), xii\u2013xiv</ref> of Sherwood Anderson's life.<ref>Rideout (2006), 149\u2013155</ref>\n\nOn Thursday, November 28, 1912, Anderson came to his office in a slightly nervous state. According to his secretary, he opened some mail, and in the course of dictating a business letter became distracted. After writing a note to his wife, he murmured something along the lines of \"I feel as though my feet were wet, and they keep getting wetter.\"<ref group=\"note\">The quote above comes from the Frances Shute, Anderson's secretary at the time, as cited in Rideout (2006), 155. In Anderson (1924), it was remembered as \"I have been wading in a long river and my feet are wet. My feet are cold, wet and heavy from long wading in a river. Now I shall go walk on dry land,\" whereas in Anderson (1942), it was \"My feet are cold and wet. I have been walking too long on the bed of a river.\"</ref> and left the office. Four days later, on Sunday December 1, a disoriented Anderson entered a drug store on East 152nd Street in Cleveland and asked the pharmacist to help figure out his identity. Unable to make out what the incoherent Anderson was saying, the pharmacist discovered a phone book on his person and called the number of Edwin Baxter, a member of the Elyria Chamber of Commerce. Baxter came, recognized Anderson, and promptly had him checked into the Huron Road Hospital in downtown Cleveland, where Anderson's wife, who he would hardly recognize, went to meet him.<ref>Most Anderson's biographers agree on the events included here. For a general sense, see Rideout (2006), 155\u2013156; Schevill (1951), 52\u201359; Townsend (1987), 76\u201382.</ref>\n\nBut even before returning home, Anderson began his lifelong practice of reinterpreting the story of his breakdown. Despite news reports in the ''Elyria Evening Telegram'' and the ''Cleveland Press'' following his admittance into the hospital that ascribed the cause of the breakdown to \"overwork\" and that mentioned Anderson's inability to remember what happened,<ref>See issues of December 2nd and 3rd for the former and December 3rd for the latter</ref> on December 6 the story changed. All of a sudden, the breakdown became voluntary. The ''Evening Telegram'' reported (possibly spuriously)<ref>Sutton (1967), 43\u201344</ref> that \"As soon as he recovers from the trance into which he placed himself, Sherwood Anderson ... will write a book of the sensations he experienced while he wandered over the country as a nomad.\"<ref>''Elyria Evening Telegram''(06 December 1912) as quoted in Schevill (1951), 59</ref> This same sense of personal agency is alluded to thirty years later in ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs'' (1942) where the author wrote of his thought process before walking out: \"I wanted to leave, get away from business. ... Again I resorted to slickness, to craftiness...The thought occurred to me that if men thought me a little insane they would forgive me if I lit out....\"<ref>Anderson (1942), 194</ref> This idea, however, that Anderson made a conscious decision on November 28 to make a clean break from family and business is unlikely.<ref name=\"Howe49\"/><ref>Sutton (1967), 12</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 157</ref> In the first place, contrary to what Anderson later claimed, his writing was no secret. It was known to his wife, secretary, and some business associates that for several years Anderson had been working on personal writing projects both at night and occasionally in his office at the factory.<ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\"/> Secondly, although some of the notes he wrote were to himself during his journey, notes he mailed to his wife on Saturday, addressing the envelope \"Cornelia L. Anderson, Pres., American Striving Co.,\" show that he had some semblance of memory. The general confusion and frequent incoherence the notes exhibit is unlikely to be deliberate.<ref>Sutton (1967), 36\u201339 offers the complete text of the notes with analysis, and several other biographers including Townsend (1987) and Rideout (2006) analyze and print selections.</ref> While diagnoses for the four days of Anderson's wanderings have ranged from \"[[amnesia]]\" to \"lost identity\" to \"[[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]],\" his condition is generally characterized today as a \"[[fugue state]].\"<ref>Townsend (1987), 81</ref><ref>Sperber, Michael (05 June 2013). \"[Dissociative Amnesia (Psychogenic Fugue) and a Literary Masterpiece http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychogenic-fugue-literature]\" ''Psychiatric Times''.

Kelly (1969). ''Miss Elizabeth''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.</ref>\n\n==Novelist==\nAnderson's first novel, ''[[Windy McPherson's Son]]'', was published in 1916 as part of a three-book deal with [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]]. This book, along with his second novel, ''[[Marching Men]]'' (1917), are usually considered his \"apprentice novels\" because they came before Anderson found fame with ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919) and are generally considered inferior in quality to works that followed.<ref>Howe (1951), 91</ref>\n\nAnderson's most notable work is his collection of interrelated short stories, ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919). In his memoir, he wrote that \"Hands\", the opening story, was the first \"real\" story he ever wrote.<ref>Anderson, Sherwood. ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1942.</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Instead of emphasizing plot and action, Anderson used a simple, precise, unsentimental style to reveal the frustration, loneliness, and longing in the lives of his characters. These characters are stunted by the narrowness of Midwestern small-town life and by their own limitations.\"<ref name=\"fogel\"/></blockquote>In addition, Anderson was one of the first American novelists to introduce new insights from psychology, including [[Freudian analysis]].<ref name=\"fogel\">[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/anderson.html Daniel Mark Fogel,\"Sherwood Anderson\"], ''The American Novel,'' PBS, 2007, accessed 2 June 2013</ref>\n\nAlthough his short stories were very successful, Anderson wanted to write novels, which he felt allowed a larger scale. In 1920, he published ''[[Poor White (novel)|Poor White]]'', which was rather successful. In 1923, Anderson published ''[[Many Marriages]]''; in it he explored the new sexual freedom, a theme which he continued in ''Dark Laughter'' and later writing.<ref name=\"nona\"/> ''Dark Laughter'' had its detractors, but the reviews were, on the whole, positive. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] considered ''Many Marriages'' to be Anderson's finest novel.<ref>Howe, Irving. ''Sherwood Anderson''. New York: William Sloane Associates, 1951. (pg. 254)</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1924, Sherwood and Elizabeth Prall Anderson moved to [[New Orleans]], where they lived in the historic Pontalba Apartments (540-B St. Peter Street) adjoining [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]] in the heart of the [[French Quarter]]. For a time, they entertained [[William Faulkner]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and other writers, for whom Anderson was a major influence. Critics trying to define Anderson's significance have said he was more influential through this younger generation than through his own works.<ref name=\"fogel\"/>\n\nAnderson referred to meeting Faulkner in his ambiguous and moving short story, \"A Meeting South.\" His novel ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925) drew from his New Orleans experiences and continued to explore the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Although the book was satirized by [[Ernest Hemingway]] in his novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'', it was a bestseller at the time, the only book of Anderson's to reach that status during his lifetime.\n\n==Four marriages==\nAnderson and Cornelia Lane married in 1904 and divorced in 1916 after having his only 3 children. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Editors |title=Sherwood Anderson's Biography |url=http://umich.edu/~eng217/student_projects/anderson/biography.htm |website=umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=9 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref>.  \n\nAnderson quickly married Tennessee Claflin Mitchell in 1916 and obtained a divorce [[Reno, Nevada]] in 1924.\n\nThat year Anderson married Elizabeth Norma Prall (1884\u20131976), a friend of Faulkner's whom he had met in New York. After several years that marriage also failed. In 1928 Anderson became involved with [[Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver]] (1896\u20131985).\n\nIn 1933, Anderson and Copenhaver married.<ref>Anderson (1991), pp. 8\u20139</ref> They traveled and often studied together. They were both active in the [[trade union]] movement.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/G-0005/excerpts/excerpt_2841.html ''Documenting the American South:'' Oral Histories of the American South], University of North Carolina</ref> Anderson also became close to Copenhaver's mother, [[Laura Copenhaver|Laura]].<ref name=\"virginia.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2007/copenhaver.htm|title=Virginia Women in History 2007: Laura Lu Scherer Copenhaver|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Later work==\nAnderson frequently contributed articles to newspapers. In 1935, he was commissioned to go to [[Franklin County, Virginia]] to cover a major federal trial of bootleggers and gangsters, in what was called \"The Great [[Moonshine]] Conspiracy\". More than 30 men had been indicted for trial. In his article, he said Franklin was the \"wettest county in the world,\" a phrase used as a title for a 21st-century novel by [[Matt Bondurant]].<ref name =LJ>{{cite journal| last = Fisher| first = Ann H.| title = The Wettest Country in the World [Review]| journal = Library Journal| date = 7/1/2008| volume = 133| issue = 12| page = 58}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, Anderson published ''[[Death in the Woods]]'' ([[Short story|short stories]]), ''Puzzled America'' (essays), and ''Kit Brandon: A Portrait'' (novel). In 1932, Anderson dedicated his novel ''Beyond Desire'' to Copenhaver. Although by this time he was considered to be less influential overall in American literature, some of what have become his most quoted passages were published in these later works. The books were otherwise considered inferior to his earlier ones.\n\n''Beyond Desire'' built on his interest in the trade union movement and was set during the 1929 [[Loray Mill Strike]] in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. Hemingway referred to it satirically in his novel, ''[[To Have and Have Not]]'' (1937), where he included as a minor character an author working on a novel of Gastonia.\n\nIn his later years, Anderson and Copenhaver lived on his [[Ripshin Farm]] in [[Troutdale, Virginia]], which he purchased in 1927 for use during summers.<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|title=Ripshin Farm|accessdate=2008-04-16|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606154607/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While living there, he contributed to a country newspaper, columns that were collected and published posthumously.<ref>''Return to Winesburg: Selections from Four Years of Writing for a Country Newspaper'', edited by Ray Lewis White (1967)</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Sherwood Anderson's grave marker.jpg|thumb|Anderson's grave marker at Round Hill Cemetery in Marion, Virginia.
