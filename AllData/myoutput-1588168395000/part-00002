[[Protestant]] writers of this time popularised the idea of an indigenous British Christianity that opposed the foreign \"Roman\" church and was purer (and [[proto-Protestant]]) in thought. The English church, they claimed, was not forming a new institution, but casting off the shackles of Rome and returning to its true roots as the indigenous national church of Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p= 2}}</ref>\n*  The [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] of the 18th century, in particular Romantic notions of the [[noble savage]] and the intrinsic qualities of the \"Celtic race\", further influenced ideas about Celtic Christianity. Romantics idealised the Celts as a primitive, bucolic people who were far more poetic, spiritual, and freer of [[rationalism]] than their neighbours. The Celts were seen as having an inner spiritual nature that shone through even after their form of Christianity had been destroyed by the authoritarian and rational Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|pp= 2\u20133}}</ref>\n* In the 20th and 21st centuries, ideas about \"Celtic Christians\" combined with appeals by certain modern churches, [[Modern Paganism |modern pagan]] groups, and [[New Age]] groups seeking to recover something of ancient spirituality that they believe is missing from the modern world. For these groups, Celtic Christianity becomes a cipher for whatever is lost in the modern religious experience. Corning notes that these notions say more about modern desires than about the reality of Christianity in the Early Middle Ages.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p= 3}}</ref>\n\nAttempts to associate the early Christians of Celtic-speaking [[Galatia]] (purportedly recipients of [[Paul the Apostle | Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians]]) with later Christians of north-western Europe's [[Celtic fringe]] appear fanciful.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Boyle\n| first1 = Elizabeth\n| author-link1 = \n| chapter = Writing Medieval Irish History in the Nineteenth Century \n| editor1-last = Hill\n| editor1-first = Jacqueline\n| editor2-last = Lyons\n| editor2-first = Mary Ann\n| title = Representing Irish Religious Histories: Historiography, Ideology and Practice\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a5XlDQAAQBAJ\n| series = Histories of the Sacred and Secular, 1700-2000\n| location = Cham, Switzerland\n| publisher = Springer\n| date = 2017\n| page = 72\n| isbn = 9783319415314\n| access-date = 4 February 2018\n| quote = '[...] a Celtic Christianity, with its peculiar national faults and characteristics, finds place even in the New Testament.

The [[tonsure]] differed from that elsewhere and also became a point of contention.

Gregory intended for Augustine to become the [[metropolitan bishop]] over all of southern Britain, including the existing dioceses under Welsh and Cornish control. Augustine met with British bishops in a series of conferences \u2013 known as the [[Synod of Chester]] \u2013 that attempted to assert his authority and to compel them to abandon aspects of their service that had fallen out of line with Roman practice. The [[Northumbria]]n cleric [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' is the only surviving account of these meetings: according to it, some of the clerics of the nearest British province met Augustine at a site on the border of the [[Kingdom of Kent]] that was known thereafter as Augustine's Oak. Augustine focused on seeking assistance for his work among the Saxons and reforming the Britons' [[Easter controversy|obsolete method for calculating Easter]]; the clerics responded that they would need to confer with their people and await a larger assembly.<ref name=Lloyd174175>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|pp=174\u2013175}}</ref> Bede relates that the bishops particularly consulted a hermit on how to respond. He told them to respond based on Augustine's conduct: were he to rise to greet them, they would know him for a humble servant of Christ and should submit to his authority but, were he to remain seated, they would know him to be arrogant and prideful and should reject him. As it happened, Augustine did keep his seat, provoking outrage. In the negotiations that followed, he offered to allow the Britons to maintain all their native customs but three: they should adopt Rome's more advanced method of calculating the date of Easter, reform their baptismal ritual, and join the missionary efforts among the Saxons.

In his ''[[Life of Constantine]]'', [[Eusebius]] records that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) decided that all Christians should observe a common date for Easter separate from the Jewish calculations, according to the practice of the [[bishops of Rome]] and [[bishop of Alexandria|Alexandria]].<ref name=conlet>{{Citation| author  = Constantine| author-link = Constantine the Great| chapter = Letter on the Keeping of Easter to those not present at Nicaea| date = 325| editor  = Eusebius of Caesaria| editor-link = Eusebius of Caesaria| title  = The Life of Constantine| volume = III| at = \u00a718\u201320| publication-date = 1996| isbn = 1-56085-072-8|chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.x.html}}</ref> Calculating the proper date of Easter (''[[computus]]'') then became a complicated process involving a [[lunisolar calendar]], finding the first Sunday after an idealized Passover on the first full moon after the equinox.\n\nVarious tables were drawn up, aiming to produce the necessary alignment between the [[solar year]] and the [[moon phases|phases]] of the [[ecclesiastical full moon|calendrical moon]]. The less exact [[octaeteris|8-year cycle]] was replaced by (or by the time of) [[Augustalis (bishop)|Augustalis]]'s treatise \"[[De ratione Paschae|On the measurement of Easter]]\", which includes an 84-year cycle based on [[Metonic cycle|Meton]]. This was introduced to Britain, whose clerics at some point modified it to use the [[Julian calendar]]'s original equinox on 25 March instead of the Nicaean equinox, which had already drifted to 21 March. This calendar was conserved by the Britons and Irish<ref>{{harvnb|Wormald|2006|p=224 n. 1}}</ref> while the Romans and French began to use the [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorian]] cycle of 532 years. The Romans (but not the French) then adopted the still-better work of [[Dionysius Exiguus|Dionysius]] in 525, which brought them into harmony with the [[Church of Alexandria]].\n\nIn the early 600s Christians in Ireland and Britain became aware of the divergence in dating between them and those in Europe. The first clash came in 602 when a synod of French bishops opposed the practices of the monasteries established by [[Columbanus|St&nbsp;Columbanus]]; Columbanus appealed to [[Pope Gregory I|the pope]] but received no answer and finally moved from their jurisdiction. It was a primary concern for [[Augustine of Canterbury|St&nbsp;Augustine]] and [[Gregorian mission|his mission]], although [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]]'s flight to [[D\u00e1l Riata]] and eventual restoration to his throne meant that Celtic practice was introduced to [[Northumbria]] until the 664 [[Synod of Whitby|synod in Whitby]]. The groups furthest away from the [[Gregorian mission]] were generally the readiest to acknowledge the superiority of the new tables: the bishops of southern Ireland adopted the continental system at the [[Synod of Mag L\u00e9ne]] ({{circa|lk=no|630}}); the {{circa|lk=no|697}} [[Council of Birr]] saw the northern Irish bishops follow suit.

Penitents were divided into a separate part of the church during liturgical worship, and they came to Mass wearing [[sackcloth]] and ashes in a process known as ''exomologesis'' that often involved some form of general confession.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=7\u20139}}</ref> There is evidence that this public penance was preceded by a private confession to a bishop or priest (''sacerdos''), and it seems that, for some sins, private penance was allowed instead.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=9\u201312}}</ref> Nonetheless, penance and reconciliation was prevailingly a public rite (sometimes unrepeatable), which included [[absolution]] at its conclusion.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=13\u201317}}</ref>\n\nThe Irish penitential practice spread throughout the continent, where the form of public penance had fallen into disuse. Saint [[Columbanus]] was credited with introducing the ''medicamenta paentitentiae'', the \"medicines of penance\", to Gaul at a time when they had come to be neglected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2003|p=252}}</ref> Though the process met some resistance, by 1215 the practice had become established as the norm, with the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] establishing a canonical statute requiring confession at a minimum of once per year.\n\n===Peregrinatio===\nA final distinctive tradition common across Britain and Ireland was the popularity of ''peregrinatio pro Christo'' (\"exile for Christ\"). The term ''peregrinatio'' is [[Latin]], and referred to the state of living or sojourning away from one's homeland in [[Roman law]]. It was later used by the [[Church Fathers]], in particular Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who wrote that Christians should live a life of ''peregrinatio'' in the present world while awaiting the [[Kingdom of God]]. Augustine's version of ''peregrinatio'' spread widely throughout the Christian church, but it took two additional unique meanings in Celtic countries.<ref name=Corningperegrinatio>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p=17}}</ref>\n\nIn the first sense, the penitentials prescribed permanent or temporary ''peregrinatio'' as penance for certain infractions. Additionally, there was a tradition of undertaking a voluntary ''peregrinatio pro Christo'', in which individuals permanently left their homes and put themselves entirely in God's hands. In the Irish tradition there were two types of such ''peregrinatio'', the \"lesser\" peregrinatio, involving leaving one's home area but not the island, and the \"superior\" peregrinatio, which meant leaving Ireland for good. This voluntary exile to spend one's life in a foreign land far from friends and family came to be termed the \"white martyrdom\".<ref name=woods>{{cite journal |url=http://www.spiritualitytoday.org/spir2day/853735woods.html#3 |last=Woods |first=Richard |title=The Spirituality of the Celtic Church |journal=Spirituality Today |date=Fall 1985 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=243\u2013255 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103040938/http://www.spiritualitytoday.org/spir2day/853735woods.html#3 |archive-date=3 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMost ''peregrini'' or exiles of this type were seeking personal spiritual fulfilment, but many became involved in missionary endeavours. The Briton [[Saint Patrick]] became the evangelist of Ireland during what he called his ''peregrinatio'' there, while [[Samson of Dol|Saint Samson]] left his home to ultimately become bishop in [[Brittany]]. The Irishmen [[Columba]] and [[Columbanus]] similarly founded highly important religious communities after leaving their homes.<ref name=Corningperegrinatio/> Irish-educated English Christians such as [[Gerald of Mayo]], the [[Two Ewalds]], [[Willehad]], [[Willibrord]], [[Wilfrid]], [[Ceolfrith]], and other English all followed these Irish traditions.\n\n==Other British and Irish traditions==\nA number of other distinctive traditions and practices existed (or are taken to have existed) in Britain or Ireland, but are not known to have been in use across the entire region. Different writers and commenters have identified different traditions as representative of so-called Celtic Christianity.<ref>This list includes information from {{cite book |first=Charles |last=Plummer |chapter=Excursus on the Paschal Controversy and Tonsure |title=Venerablilis Baedae, Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Plummer |orig-year=1892 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1975 |pages=348\u2013354 }}</ref>\n\n===Monasticism===\n[[Image:National Library of Ireland MS G10 p24.jpg|thumb|right|Excerpt from the [[Martyrology of Oengus]]]]\nMonastic spirituality came to Britain and then Ireland from Gaul, by way of L\u00e9rins, Tours, and Auxerre. Its spirituality was heavily influenced by the [[Desert Fathers]]. According to Richard Woods, the familial, democratic, and decentralized aspects of Egyptian Christianity were better suited to structures and values of Celtic culture than was a legalistic diocesan form.<ref name=woods/> Monasteries tended to be cenobitical in that monks lived in separate cells but came together for common prayer, meals, and other functions. Some more austere ascetics became hermits living in remote locations in what came to be called the \"green martyrdom\".<ref name=woods/> An example of this would be [[Kevin of Glendalough]] and [[Cuthbert]] of [[Lindisfarne]].\n\nOne outdated belief is that that the true ecclesiastical power in the Celtic world lay in the hands of [[abbots]] of [[monasteries]], rather than bishops of [[dioceses]].<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433>{{harvnb|Koch|2006|p=433}}</ref> It is certain that the ideal of monasticism was universally esteemed in Celtic Christianity.<ref name=Herren13>{{harvnb|Herren|Brown|2002|p=13}}</ref> This was especially true in Ireland and areas evangelised by Irish missionaries, where monasteries and their abbots came to be vested with a great deal of ecclesiastical and secular power.

They were usually descended from one of the many Irish royal families, and the founding regulations of the abbey sometimes specified that the abbotcy should if possible be kept within one family lineage.<ref>[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, D\u00e1ibh\u00ed]] in {{harvnb|Youngs|1989|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nThis focus on the monastery has led some scholars, most notably [[Kathleen Hughes (historian)|Kathleen Hughes]], to argue that the monastic system came to be the dominant ecclesiastical structure in the Irish church, essentially replacing the earlier [[Episcopal polity|episcopal structure]] of the type found in most of the rest of the Christian world.<ref name=Hughes311>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=311 and note }}</ref> Hughes argued that the ''paruchia'', or network of monasteries attached to an [[abbey]], replaced the diocese as the chief administrative unit of the church, and the position of Abbot largely replaced that of bishop in authority and prominence.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=312}}</ref> According to this model, bishops were still needed, since certain [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacramental]] functions were reserved only for the ordained, but they had little authority in the ecclesiastical structure.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|pp=32\u201334}}</ref>\n\nHowever, more recent scholarship, particularly the work of [[Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in]] and [[Richard Sharpe (historian)|Richard Sharpe]], has offered a more nuanced view of the interrelationships between the monastic system and the traditional Church structures.<ref name=Hughes311/> Sharpe argues that there is no evidence that the ''paruchia'' overrode the diocese, or that the abbot replaced the Bishop;<ref name=Herren13/> Bishops still exercised ultimate spiritual authority and remained in charge of the diocesan clergy.<ref name=Hughes311/> But either way, the monastic ideal was regarded as the utmost expression of the Christian life.<ref name=Herren13/>\n\nThe focus on powerful abbots and monasteries was limited to the Irish Church, however, and not in Britain. The British church employed an episcopal structure corresponding closely to the model used elsewhere in the Christian world.<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433/>\n\nIrish monasticism was notable for its permeability. In permeable monasticism, people were able to move freely in and out of the monastic system at different points of life. Young boys and girls would enter the system to pursue Latin scholarship.  Students would sometimes travel from faraway lands to enter the Irish monasteries. When these students became adults, they would leave the monastery to live out their lives. Eventually, these people would retire back to secure community provided by the monastery and stay until their death. However, some would stay within the monastery and become leaders. Since most of the clergy were Irish, native traditions were well-respected. Permeable monasticism popularised the use of vernacular and helped mesh the norms of secular and monastic element in Ireland, unlike other parts of Europe where monasteries were more isolated. Examples of these intertwining motifs can be seen in the hagiographies of [[St. Brigid]] and [[St. Columba]].<ref name=\"de Paor 1958\">{{cite book|last1=de Paor|first1=M\u00e1ire|last2=de Paor|author1link=M\u00e1ire de Paor|first2=Liam|title=Early Christian Ireland: Ancient Peoples and Places|year=1958|publisher=Frederick A. Praeger}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThis willingness to learn, and also to teach, was a hallmark of the \"permeable monasticism\" that so characterised the Irish monastery. While a hermitage was still the highest form of dedication, the monasteries were very open to allowing students and children within the walls for an education, without requiring them to become monks. These students were then allowed to leave and live within the community, and were welcomed back in their old age to retire in peace. This style of monasticism allowed for the monastery to connect with, and become a part of, the community at large. The availability of the monks to the people was instrumental in converting Ireland from paganism to Christianity, allowing a blend of the two cultures.<ref name=\"de Paor 1958\"/>{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n====Wales====\n{{main article|Clas (ecclesiastical settlement)}}\nAccording to [[hagiography|hagiographies]] written some centuries later, [[Illtud]] and his pupils [[Saint David|David]], Gildas, and [[Deiniol]] were leading figures in 6th-century Britain.\n\nNot far from Llantwit Fawr stood [[Cadoc]]'s foundation of [[Llancarfan]], founded in the latter part of the fifth century.

Cadoc followed his father's example and received the religious habit from St. Tathai, an Irish monk, superior of a small community at Swent near Chepstow, in Monmouthshire. Returning to his native county, Cadoc built a church and monastery, which was called Llancarfan, or the \"Church of the Stags\". Here he established a monastery, college and hospital.

Monks from [[Iona Abbey|Iona]] under [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|St. Aidan]] founded the See of [[Lindisfarne]] in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Northumbria]] in 635, whence Gaelic-Irish practice heavily influenced northern England.\n\nIrish monks also founded monasteries across the continent, exerting influence greater than many more ancient continental centres.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=36}}</ref> The first issuance of a papal privilege granting a monastery freedom from episcopal oversight was that of Pope Honorius I to [[Bobbio Abbey]], one of Columbanus's institutions.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=37}}</ref>\n\nAt least in Ireland, the monastic system became increasingly secularised from the 8th century, as close ties between ruling families and monasteries became apparent. The major monasteries were now wealthy in land and had political importance. On occasion they made war either upon each other or took part in secular wars \u2013 a battle in 764 is supposed to have killed 200 from [[Durrow Abbey]] when they were defeated by [[Clonmacnoise]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=317}}</ref> From early periods the kin nature of many monasteries had meant that some married men were part of the community, supplying labour and with some rights, including in the election of abbots (but obliged to abstain from sex during fasting periods). Some abbacies passed from father to son, and then even grandsons.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=313, 316, 319}}</ref> A revival of the [[ascetic]] tradition came in the second half of the century, with the [[culdee]] or \"clients ([[vassal]]s) of God\" movement founding new monasteries detached from family groupings.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=319\u2013320}}</ref>\n\n===Rule of Columbanus===\nThe monasteries of the Irish missions, and many at home, adopted the Rule of Saint [[Columbanus]], which was stricter than the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], the main alternative in the West.  In particular there was more [[fasting]] and an emphasis on [[corporal punishment]]. For some generations monks trained by Irish missionaries continued to use the Rule and to found new monasteries using it, but most converted to the Benedictine Rule over the 8th and 9th centuries.{{efn|The main source for Columbanus's life or vita is recorded by [[Jonas of Bobbio]], an Italian monk who entered the monastery in Bobbio in 618, three years after the Saint's death; Jonas wrote the life c. 643. This author lived during the abbacy of Attala, Columbanus's immediate successor, and his informants had been companions of the saint. Mabillon in the second volume of his \"Acta Sanctorum O.S.B.\" gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the miracles of the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.}}\n\nAgain, however, the Rule of Columbanus was used exclusively in monasteries in the Irish sphere of influence; it was not followed in British monasteries.\n\n===Baptism===\nBede implies that in the time of Augustine of Canterbury, British churches used a baptismal rite that was in some way at variance with the Roman practice. According to Bede, the British Christians' failure to \"complete\" the sacrament of baptism was one of the three specific issues with British practice that Augustine could not overlook.<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|p=175}}</ref> There is no indication as to how the baptism was \"incomplete\" according to the Roman custom. It may be that there was some difference in the [[confirmation]] rite, or that there was no confirmation at all.<ref name=Lloyd177/> At any rate, it is unlikely to have caused as much discord as the Easter controversy or the tonsure, as no other source mentions it.<ref name=Lloyd177/> As such there is no evidence that heterodox baptism figured into the practice of the Irish church.<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433/>\n\n===Accusations of Judaizing===\nA recurrent accusation levelled against the Irish throughout the Middle Ages is that they were [[Judaizers]], which is to say that they observed certain religious rites after the manner of the Jews.<ref name=\"flech\"/> The belief that Irish Christians were Judaizers can be observed in three main areas: the Easter Controversy, the notion that the Irish practiced obsolete laws from the [[Old Testament]] and (not unrelated to this) the view that they adhered too closely to the Old Testament. Quite apart from the intricate theological concerns that underpinned the debate over Easter in early 7th-century Gaul, Columbanus also found himself accused of [[Quartodecimanism]], a heresy whose central tenet was observing Easter on the same date as the eve of the Jewish [[Passover]], namely the fourteenth day of the Jewish lunar month of [[Nisan]]. Although this false accusation was raised at a time of heightened political tensions between Columbanus and the Gallic bishops, some historians have cautioned that it ought not be dismissed as a mere ruse because the Gauls may have been genuinely worried about blurring the boundaries between Gallic Christians and their Jewish neighbours.<ref>{{harvnb|Stancliffe|1992|pp=211\u201312}}</ref> That the Irish practiced obsolete Old Testament laws is another accusation that repeats itself a number of times in the early Middle Ages, most famously in the case of the 8th-century Irish charismatic preacher, [[Clement Scotus I]] (fl. 745), who was condemned as a heretic, in part for urging followers to follow Old Testament law in such controversial matters as obliging a man to marry his widowed sister-in-law upon his brother's death.<ref name=\"Meeder\">{{harvnb|Meeder|2011|pp=251\u201380}}</ref> Finally, a good example for the Irish tendency to adhere closely to the Old Testament is the [[Collectio canonum Hibernensis|''Hibernensis'']], a late 7th- or early 8th-century Irish canon law collection which was the first text of church law to draw heavily on the Bible, and in particular the Old Testament, at a time when Christians were meant to be \"dead to the old law\" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+7%3A4&version=NIV Romans 7:4]). In Scotland similar accusations surround the supposed [[Scottish pork taboo|cultural taboo concerning pork]].\n\n==Celtic Christian revivalism==\n{{See also|Neo-Celtic Christianity}}\n[[Ian Bradley]] notes that the recurrent interest in medieval insular Christianity has led to successive [[revival movement]]s he terms \"Celtic Christian revivalism\". According to Bradley, most, though not all, revivalists are non-Celts for whom Celtic Christianity has an \"exotic and peripheral\" appeal.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|pp=viii\u2013ix}}</ref> Adherents typically claim their revivals restore authentic practices and traits, though Bradley notes they reflect contemporary concerns and prejudices much more closely, and most are \"at least partially inspired and driven by denominational and national rivalries, ecclesiastical and secular power politics, and an anti-Roman Catholic agenda.\" Though often inaccurate or distorted, the beliefs of these movements have greatly influenced popular conceptions of historical Celtic Christianity.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|p=ix}}</ref>\n\nBradley traces the origins of Celtic Christian revivalism to the Middle Ages. In the 8th and 9th century, authors wrote idealised [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of earlier saints, whose \"golden age\" of extraordinary holiness contrasted with the perceived corruption of later times. Similarly, the 12th- and 13th-century [[Renaissance of the 12th century|literary revival]] popularised and romanticised older Celtic traditions such as the [[Arthurian legend]]. These ideas were expanded during the [[English Reformation]], as Protestant authors appropriated the concept of a \"Celtic Church\" as a native, anti-Roman predecessor to their own movement.<ref name=Bradleyviii>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|p=viii}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, [[antiquarian]]ism, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement, and growing nationalism influenced ideas about what was becoming known as \"Celtic Christianity\". Beginning in the early 20th century, a full-fledged revival movement began, centred on the island of [[Iona]] and influenced by the [[Irish Literary Revival]] and more general Christian revivals. By the end of the 20th century, another wave of enthusiasm began, this time influenced by [[New Age]] ideals.<ref name=Bradleyviii/> Today, a self-identification with and use of \"Celtic Christianity\" is common in countries such as [[Religion in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], both among participants in established churches and independent groups.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gierek |first=Bozena |chapter=Celtic spirituality in contemporary Ireland |pages=300\u2013317 |editor1-first=Olivia |editor1-last=Cosgrove |editor2-first=Laurence |editor2-last=Cox |editor3-first=Carmen |editor3-last=Kuhling |editor4-first=Peter |editor4-last=Mulholland |title=Ireland's new religious movements: Alternative Spiritualities, Migrant Religions, the New Age and New Religious Movements |location=Newcastle upon Tyne |publisher=Cambridge Scholars |date=2011 |oclc=758707463 |isbn=978-1-4438-2588-7 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Wales|Cornwall}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ancient Celtic religion]]\n* [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity]]\n* [[History of Ireland (400\u2013800)]]\n* [[History of Christianity in Ireland]]\n* [[Ancient British Church]] (part of the \"neo-Celtic Christian\" restoration movement of 19th century origin)\n* [[Celtic Orthodox Church]]\n* [[Celtic Christian traditions in Gwynedd until 1100]]\n* [[Christianity in Ireland]]\n* [[David Adam (priest)]]\n* [[Gallican Rite]]\n* [[Gregorian Reform]]\n* [[Papar]]\n* [[Quartodecimanism]]\n* [[Richard Williams Morgan]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Primary sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |author=Adomnan |title=Life of Columba |editor1-first=A.O. |editor1-last=Anderson |editor2-first=M.O. |editor2-last=Anderson |edition=2nd |publisher=Oxford Medieval Texts |date=1991 }}\n* {{cite book |title=Annales Cambriae |editor-first=John |editor-last=Williams |location=London |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts |date=1860 |url=https://archive.org/details/annalescambriae00willgoog |via=Internet Archive }}\n* {{cite book |author=Bede |title=Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Angelorum |series=Venerabilis Baedae Opera Historica |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Plummer |location=Oxonii |publisher=E Typographeo Clarendoniano |date=1896 |url=https://archive.org/details/historiamecclesi02bedeuoft |via=Internet Archive }}\n* {{cite book |author=Cummian |title=De controversia paschali and De ratione conputandi |editor1-first=Maura |editor1-last=Walsh |editor2-first=D\u00e1ibh\u00ed |editor2-last=\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn |editor2-link=D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn |location=Toronto |publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies |date=1988 |pages=93\u20135 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Gildas |title=De Excidio Brittaniae |editor-first=J.A. |editor-last=Giles |editor-link=J.

[[Protestant]] writers of this time popularised the idea of an indigenous British Christianity that opposed the foreign \"Roman\" church and was purer (and [[proto-Protestant]]) in thought. The English church, they claimed, was not forming a new institution, but casting off the shackles of Rome and returning to its true roots as the indigenous national church of Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p= 2}}</ref>\n*  The [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] of the 18th century, in particular Romantic notions of the [[noble savage]] and the intrinsic qualities of the \"Celtic race\", further influenced ideas about Celtic Christianity. Romantics idealised the Celts as a primitive, bucolic people who were far more poetic, spiritual, and freer of [[rationalism]] than their neighbours. The Celts were seen as having an inner spiritual nature that shone through even after their form of Christianity had been destroyed by the authoritarian and rational Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|pp= 2\u20133}}</ref>\n* In the 20th and 21st centuries, ideas about \"Celtic Christians\" combined with appeals by certain modern churches, [[Modern Paganism |modern pagan]] groups, and [[New Age]] groups seeking to recover something of ancient spirituality that they believe is missing from the modern world. For these groups, Celtic Christianity becomes a cipher for whatever is lost in the modern religious experience.

Gregory intended for Augustine to become the [[metropolitan bishop]] over all of southern Britain, including the existing dioceses under Welsh and Cornish control. Augustine met with British bishops in a series of conferences \u2013 known as the [[Synod of Chester]] \u2013 that attempted to assert his authority and to compel them to abandon aspects of their service that had fallen out of line with Roman practice. The [[Northumbria]]n cleric [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' is the only surviving account of these meetings: according to it, some of the clerics of the nearest British province met Augustine at a site on the border of the [[Kingdom of Kent]] that was known thereafter as Augustine's Oak. Augustine focused on seeking assistance for his work among the Saxons and reforming the Britons' [[Easter controversy|obsolete method for calculating Easter]]; the clerics responded that they would need to confer with their people and await a larger assembly.<ref name=Lloyd174175>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|pp=174\u2013175}}</ref> Bede relates that the bishops particularly consulted a hermit on how to respond.

As it happened, Augustine did keep his seat, provoking outrage. In the negotiations that followed, he offered to allow the Britons to maintain all their native customs but three: they should adopt Rome's more advanced method of calculating the date of Easter, reform their baptismal ritual, and join the missionary efforts among the Saxons.

In addition to Easter dating, Irish scholars and cleric-scholars in continental Europe found themselves implicated in theological controversies but it is not always possible to distinguish when a controversy was based on matters of substance or on political grounds or xenophobic sentiments.<ref name=\"flech\">{{harvnb|Flechner|Meeder|2016|pp=231\u201341}}</ref> Synods were held in Ireland, Gaul, and England (e.g. the [[Synod of Whitby]]) at which Irish and British religious rites were rejected but a degree of variation continued in Britain after the Ionan church accepted the Roman date.\n\nThe Easter question was settled at various times in different places. The following dates are derived from Haddan and Stubbs: southern Ireland, 626\u2013628; northern Ireland, 692; Northumbria (converted by Irish missions), 664; East Devon and Somerset, the Britons under Wessex, 705; the Picts, 710; Iona, 716\u2013718; Strathclyde, 721; North Wales, 768; South Wales, 777. Cornwall held out the longest of any, perhaps even, in parts, to the time of Bishop Aedwulf of Crediton (909).<ref>A. W. Haddan and W.

In his ''[[Life of Constantine]]'', [[Eusebius]] records that the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) decided that all Christians should observe a common date for Easter separate from the Jewish calculations, according to the practice of the [[bishops of Rome]] and [[bishop of Alexandria|Alexandria]].<ref name=conlet>{{Citation| author  = Constantine| author-link = Constantine the Great| chapter = Letter on the Keeping of Easter to those not present at Nicaea| date = 325| editor  = Eusebius of Caesaria| editor-link = Eusebius of Caesaria| title  = The Life of Constantine| volume = III| at = \u00a718\u201320| publication-date = 1996| isbn = 1-56085-072-8|chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.x.html}}</ref> Calculating the proper date of Easter (''[[computus]]'') then became a complicated process involving a [[lunisolar calendar]], finding the first Sunday after an idealized Passover on the first full moon after the equinox.\n\nVarious tables were drawn up, aiming to produce the necessary alignment between the [[solar year]] and the [[moon phases|phases]] of the [[ecclesiastical full moon|calendrical moon]]. The less exact [[octaeteris|8-year cycle]] was replaced by (or by the time of) [[Augustalis (bishop)|Augustalis]]'s treatise \"[[De ratione Paschae|On the measurement of Easter]]\", which includes an 84-year cycle based on [[Metonic cycle|Meton]]. This was introduced to Britain, whose clerics at some point modified it to use the [[Julian calendar]]'s original equinox on 25 March instead of the Nicaean equinox, which had already drifted to 21 March. This calendar was conserved by the Britons and Irish<ref>{{harvnb|Wormald|2006|p=224 n. 1}}</ref> while the Romans and French began to use the [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorian]] cycle of 532 years. The Romans (but not the French) then adopted the still-better work of [[Dionysius Exiguus|Dionysius]] in 525, which brought them into harmony with the [[Church of Alexandria]].\n\nIn the early 600s Christians in Ireland and Britain became aware of the divergence in dating between them and those in Europe. The first clash came in 602 when a synod of French bishops opposed the practices of the monasteries established by [[Columbanus|St&nbsp;Columbanus]]; Columbanus appealed to [[Pope Gregory I|the pope]] but received no answer and finally moved from their jurisdiction. It was a primary concern for [[Augustine of Canterbury|St&nbsp;Augustine]] and [[Gregorian mission|his mission]], although [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]]'s flight to [[D\u00e1l Riata]] and eventual restoration to his throne meant that Celtic practice was introduced to [[Northumbria]] until the 664 [[Synod of Whitby|synod in Whitby]]. The groups furthest away from the [[Gregorian mission]] were generally the readiest to acknowledge the superiority of the new tables: the bishops of southern Ireland adopted the continental system at the [[Synod of Mag L\u00e9ne]] ({{circa|lk=no|630}}); the {{circa|lk=no|697}} [[Council of Birr]] saw the northern Irish bishops follow suit. The [[Iona Abbey|abbey at Iona]] and its satellites held out until 716,<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=34}}</ref> while the Welsh did not adopt the Roman and Saxon ''[[computus]]'' until induced to do so around 768 by [[Elfodd]], [[bishop of Bangor|\"archbishop\" of Bangor]].\n\n===Monastic tonsure===\n[[File:Fra Angelico 052.jpg|left|thumb|The \"Roman\" [[tonsure]], in the shape of a crown, differing from the Irish tradition, which is unclear but involved shaving the hair from ear to ear in some fashion]]\nAll monks of the period, and apparently most or all clergy, kept a distinct [[tonsure]], or method of cutting one's hair, to distinguish their social identity as men of the cloth.

Penitents were divided into a separate part of the church during liturgical worship, and they came to Mass wearing [[sackcloth]] and ashes in a process known as ''exomologesis'' that often involved some form of general confession.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=7\u20139}}</ref> There is evidence that this public penance was preceded by a private confession to a bishop or priest (''sacerdos''), and it seems that, for some sins, private penance was allowed instead.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=9\u201312}}</ref> Nonetheless, penance and reconciliation was prevailingly a public rite (sometimes unrepeatable), which included [[absolution]] at its conclusion.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=13\u201317}}</ref>\n\nThe Irish penitential practice spread throughout the continent, where the form of public penance had fallen into disuse. Saint [[Columbanus]] was credited with introducing the ''medicamenta paentitentiae'', the \"medicines of penance\", to Gaul at a time when they had come to be neglected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2003|p=252}}</ref> Though the process met some resistance, by 1215 the practice had become established as the norm, with the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] establishing a canonical statute requiring confession at a minimum of once per year.\n\n===Peregrinatio===\nA final distinctive tradition common across Britain and Ireland was the popularity of ''peregrinatio pro Christo'' (\"exile for Christ\"). The term ''peregrinatio'' is [[Latin]], and referred to the state of living or sojourning away from one's homeland in [[Roman law]]. It was later used by the [[Church Fathers]], in particular Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who wrote that Christians should live a life of ''peregrinatio'' in the present world while awaiting the [[Kingdom of God]]. Augustine's version of ''peregrinatio'' spread widely throughout the Christian church, but it took two additional unique meanings in Celtic countries.<ref name=Corningperegrinatio>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p=17}}</ref>\n\nIn the first sense, the penitentials prescribed permanent or temporary ''peregrinatio'' as penance for certain infractions. Additionally, there was a tradition of undertaking a voluntary ''peregrinatio pro Christo'', in which individuals permanently left their homes and put themselves entirely in God's hands. In the Irish tradition there were two types of such ''peregrinatio'', the \"lesser\" peregrinatio, involving leaving one's home area but not the island, and the \"superior\" peregrinatio, which meant leaving Ireland for good. This voluntary exile to spend one's life in a foreign land far from friends and family came to be termed the \"white martyrdom\".<ref name=woods>{{cite journal |url=http://www.spiritualitytoday.org/spir2day/853735woods.html#3 |last=Woods |first=Richard |title=The Spirituality of the Celtic Church |journal=Spirituality Today |date=Fall 1985 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=243\u2013255 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103040938/http://www.spiritualitytoday.org/spir2day/853735woods.html#3 |archive-date=3 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMost ''peregrini'' or exiles of this type were seeking personal spiritual fulfilment, but many became involved in missionary endeavours. The Briton [[Saint Patrick]] became the evangelist of Ireland during what he called his ''peregrinatio'' there, while [[Samson of Dol|Saint Samson]] left his home to ultimately become bishop in [[Brittany]]. The Irishmen [[Columba]] and [[Columbanus]] similarly founded highly important religious communities after leaving their homes.<ref name=Corningperegrinatio/> Irish-educated English Christians such as [[Gerald of Mayo]], the [[Two Ewalds]], [[Willehad]], [[Willibrord]], [[Wilfrid]], [[Ceolfrith]], and other English all followed these Irish traditions.\n\n==Other British and Irish traditions==\nA number of other distinctive traditions and practices existed (or are taken to have existed) in Britain or Ireland, but are not known to have been in use across the entire region. Different writers and commenters have identified different traditions as representative of so-called Celtic Christianity.<ref>This list includes information from {{cite book |first=Charles |last=Plummer |chapter=Excursus on the Paschal Controversy and Tonsure |title=Venerablilis Baedae, Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Plummer |orig-year=1892 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1975 |pages=348\u2013354 }}</ref>\n\n===Monasticism===\n[[Image:National Library of Ireland MS G10 p24.jpg|thumb|right|Excerpt from the [[Martyrology of Oengus]]]]\nMonastic spirituality came to Britain and then Ireland from Gaul, by way of L\u00e9rins, Tours, and Auxerre. Its spirituality was heavily influenced by the [[Desert Fathers]]. According to Richard Woods, the familial, democratic, and decentralized aspects of Egyptian Christianity were better suited to structures and values of Celtic culture than was a legalistic diocesan form.<ref name=woods/> Monasteries tended to be cenobitical in that monks lived in separate cells but came together for common prayer, meals, and other functions. Some more austere ascetics became hermits living in remote locations in what came to be called the \"green martyrdom\".<ref name=woods/> An example of this would be [[Kevin of Glendalough]] and [[Cuthbert]] of [[Lindisfarne]].\n\nOne outdated belief is that that the true ecclesiastical power in the Celtic world lay in the hands of [[abbots]] of [[monasteries]], rather than bishops of [[dioceses]].<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433>{{harvnb|Koch|2006|p=433}}</ref> It is certain that the ideal of monasticism was universally esteemed in Celtic Christianity.<ref name=Herren13>{{harvnb|Herren|Brown|2002|p=13}}</ref> This was especially true in Ireland and areas evangelised by Irish missionaries, where monasteries and their abbots came to be vested with a great deal of ecclesiastical and secular power. Following the growth of the monastic movement in the 6th century, abbots controlled not only individual monasteries, but also expansive estates and the secular communities that tended them.<ref name=Hughes311312>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=311\u2013312}}</ref> As monastics, abbots were not necessarily [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|ordained]] (i.e. they were not necessarily [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] or bishops). They were usually descended from one of the many Irish royal families, and the founding regulations of the abbey sometimes specified that the abbotcy should if possible be kept within one family lineage.<ref>[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, D\u00e1ibh\u00ed]] in {{harvnb|Youngs|1989|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nThis focus on the monastery has led some scholars, most notably [[Kathleen Hughes (historian)|Kathleen Hughes]], to argue that the monastic system came to be the dominant ecclesiastical structure in the Irish church, essentially replacing the earlier [[Episcopal polity|episcopal structure]] of the type found in most of the rest of the Christian world.<ref name=Hughes311>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=311 and note }}</ref> Hughes argued that the ''paruchia'', or network of monasteries attached to an [[abbey]], replaced the diocese as the chief administrative unit of the church, and the position of Abbot largely replaced that of bishop in authority and prominence.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=312}}</ref> According to this model, bishops were still needed, since certain [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacramental]] functions were reserved only for the ordained, but they had little authority in the ecclesiastical structure.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|pp=32\u201334}}</ref>\n\nHowever, more recent scholarship, particularly the work of [[Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in]] and [[Richard Sharpe (historian)|Richard Sharpe]], has offered a more nuanced view of the interrelationships between the monastic system and the traditional Church structures.<ref name=Hughes311/> Sharpe argues that there is no evidence that the ''paruchia'' overrode the diocese, or that the abbot replaced the Bishop;<ref name=Herren13/> Bishops still exercised ultimate spiritual authority and remained in charge of the diocesan clergy.<ref name=Hughes311/> But either way, the monastic ideal was regarded as the utmost expression of the Christian life.<ref name=Herren13/>\n\nThe focus on powerful abbots and monasteries was limited to the Irish Church, however, and not in Britain. The British church employed an episcopal structure corresponding closely to the model used elsewhere in the Christian world.<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433/>\n\nIrish monasticism was notable for its permeability. In permeable monasticism, people were able to move freely in and out of the monastic system at different points of life. Young boys and girls would enter the system to pursue Latin scholarship.  Students would sometimes travel from faraway lands to enter the Irish monasteries. When these students became adults, they would leave the monastery to live out their lives. Eventually, these people would retire back to secure community provided by the monastery and stay until their death. However, some would stay within the monastery and become leaders. Since most of the clergy were Irish, native traditions were well-respected. Permeable monasticism popularised the use of vernacular and helped mesh the norms of secular and monastic element in Ireland, unlike other parts of Europe where monasteries were more isolated. Examples of these intertwining motifs can be seen in the hagiographies of [[St. Brigid]] and [[St. Columba]].<ref name=\"de Paor 1958\">{{cite book|last1=de Paor|first1=M\u00e1ire|last2=de Paor|author1link=M\u00e1ire de Paor|first2=Liam|title=Early Christian Ireland: Ancient Peoples and Places|year=1958|publisher=Frederick A. Praeger}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThis willingness to learn, and also to teach, was a hallmark of the \"permeable monasticism\" that so characterised the Irish monastery. While a hermitage was still the highest form of dedication, the monasteries were very open to allowing students and children within the walls for an education, without requiring them to become monks. These students were then allowed to leave and live within the community, and were welcomed back in their old age to retire in peace. This style of monasticism allowed for the monastery to connect with, and become a part of, the community at large. The availability of the monks to the people was instrumental in converting Ireland from paganism to Christianity, allowing a blend of the two cultures.<ref name=\"de Paor 1958\"/>{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n====Wales====\n{{main article|Clas (ecclesiastical settlement)}}\nAccording to [[hagiography|hagiographies]] written some centuries later, [[Illtud]] and his pupils [[Saint David|David]], Gildas, and [[Deiniol]] were leading figures in 6th-century Britain.\n\nNot far from Llantwit Fawr stood [[Cadoc]]'s foundation of [[Llancarfan]], founded in the latter part of the fifth century. The son of [[Gwynllyw]], a prince of South Wales, who before his death renounced the world to lead an eremitical life. Cadoc followed his father's example and received the religious habit from St. Tathai, an Irish monk, superior of a small community at Swent near Chepstow, in Monmouthshire. Returning to his native county, Cadoc built a church and monastery, which was called Llancarfan, or the \"Church of the Stags\". Here he established a monastery, college and hospital. The spot at first seemed an impossible one, and an almost inaccessible marsh, but he and his monks drained and cultivated it, transforming it into one of the most famous religious houses in South Wales.<ref name=Chandlery>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15585a.htm |last=Chandlery |first=Peter |title=Welsh Monastic Foundations |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |volume=15 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |date=1912 |access-date=18 December 2015 }}</ref> His legend recounts that he daily fed a hundred clergy and a hundred soldiers, a hundred workmen, a hundred poor men, and the same number of widows.

Contemporary with David were [[Saint Teilo]], Cadoc, [[Padarn]], [[Beuno]] and [[Tysilio]] among them. It was from Illtud and his successors that the Irish sought guidance on matters of ritual and discipline. [[Finnian of Clonard]] studied under Cadoc at [[Llancarfan]] in [[Glamorgan]].\n\n====Ireland====\n[[Finnian of Clonard]] is said to have trained the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]] at [[Clonard Abbey]]. \n[[File:BookMullingFol193StJohnPortrait.jpg|thumb|[[John the Evangelist|Saint John]], [[evangelist portrait]] from the [[Book of Mulling]], Irish, late 8th century]]\nThe achievements of [[insular art]], in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], [[high cross]]es, and metalwork like the [[Ardagh Chalice]] remain very well known, and in the case of manuscript decoration had a profound influence on Western medieval art.<ref>{{harvnb|Nordenfalk|1977}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}; {{harvnb|P\u00e4cht|1986}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The manuscripts were certainly produced by and for monasteries, and the evidence suggests that metalwork was produced in both monastic and royal workshops, perhaps as well as secular commercial ones.<ref>{{harvnb|Youngs|1989|pp=15\u201316, 125}}</ref>\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, Irish monks established monastic institutions in parts of modern-day Scotland (especially [[Columba]], also known as ''Colmcille'' or, in [[Old Irish]], ''Colum Cille''), and on the [[Continental Europe|continent]], particularly in Gaul (especially [[Columbanus]]). Monks from [[Iona Abbey|Iona]] under [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|St. Aidan]] founded the See of [[Lindisfarne]] in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Northumbria]] in 635, whence Gaelic-Irish practice heavily influenced northern England.\n\nIrish monks also founded monasteries across the continent, exerting influence greater than many more ancient continental centres.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=36}}</ref> The first issuance of a papal privilege granting a monastery freedom from episcopal oversight was that of Pope Honorius I to [[Bobbio Abbey]], one of Columbanus's institutions.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=37}}</ref>\n\nAt least in Ireland, the monastic system became increasingly secularised from the 8th century, as close ties between ruling families and monasteries became apparent. The major monasteries were now wealthy in land and had political importance. On occasion they made war either upon each other or took part in secular wars \u2013 a battle in 764 is supposed to have killed 200 from [[Durrow Abbey]] when they were defeated by [[Clonmacnoise]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=317}}</ref> From early periods the kin nature of many monasteries had meant that some married men were part of the community, supplying labour and with some rights, including in the election of abbots (but obliged to abstain from sex during fasting periods). Some abbacies passed from father to son, and then even grandsons.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=313, 316, 319}}</ref> A revival of the [[ascetic]] tradition came in the second half of the century, with the [[culdee]] or \"clients ([[vassal]]s) of God\" movement founding new monasteries detached from family groupings.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=319\u2013320}}</ref>\n\n===Rule of Columbanus===\nThe monasteries of the Irish missions, and many at home, adopted the Rule of Saint [[Columbanus]], which was stricter than the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], the main alternative in the West.  In particular there was more [[fasting]] and an emphasis on [[corporal punishment]]. For some generations monks trained by Irish missionaries continued to use the Rule and to found new monasteries using it, but most converted to the Benedictine Rule over the 8th and 9th centuries.{{efn|The main source for Columbanus's life or vita is recorded by [[Jonas of Bobbio]], an Italian monk who entered the monastery in Bobbio in 618, three years after the Saint's death; Jonas wrote the life c. 643. This author lived during the abbacy of Attala, Columbanus's immediate successor, and his informants had been companions of the saint. Mabillon in the second volume of his \"Acta Sanctorum O.S.B.\" gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the miracles of the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.}}\n\nAgain, however, the Rule of Columbanus was used exclusively in monasteries in the Irish sphere of influence; it was not followed in British monasteries.\n\n===Baptism===\nBede implies that in the time of Augustine of Canterbury, British churches used a baptismal rite that was in some way at variance with the Roman practice. According to Bede, the British Christians' failure to \"complete\" the sacrament of baptism was one of the three specific issues with British practice that Augustine could not overlook.<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|p=175}}</ref> There is no indication as to how the baptism was \"incomplete\" according to the Roman custom. It may be that there was some difference in the [[confirmation]] rite, or that there was no confirmation at all.<ref name=Lloyd177/> At any rate, it is unlikely to have caused as much discord as the Easter controversy or the tonsure, as no other source mentions it.<ref name=Lloyd177/> As such there is no evidence that heterodox baptism figured into the practice of the Irish church.<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433/>\n\n===Accusations of Judaizing===\nA recurrent accusation levelled against the Irish throughout the Middle Ages is that they were [[Judaizers]], which is to say that they observed certain religious rites after the manner of the Jews.<ref name=\"flech\"/> The belief that Irish Christians were Judaizers can be observed in three main areas: the Easter Controversy, the notion that the Irish practiced obsolete laws from the [[Old Testament]] and (not unrelated to this) the view that they adhered too closely to the Old Testament. Quite apart from the intricate theological concerns that underpinned the debate over Easter in early 7th-century Gaul, Columbanus also found himself accused of [[Quartodecimanism]], a heresy whose central tenet was observing Easter on the same date as the eve of the Jewish [[Passover]], namely the fourteenth day of the Jewish lunar month of [[Nisan]]. Although this false accusation was raised at a time of heightened political tensions between Columbanus and the Gallic bishops, some historians have cautioned that it ought not be dismissed as a mere ruse because the Gauls may have been genuinely worried about blurring the boundaries between Gallic Christians and their Jewish neighbours.<ref>{{harvnb|Stancliffe|1992|pp=211\u201312}}</ref> That the Irish practiced obsolete Old Testament laws is another accusation that repeats itself a number of times in the early Middle Ages, most famously in the case of the 8th-century Irish charismatic preacher, [[Clement Scotus I]] (fl. 745), who was condemned as a heretic, in part for urging followers to follow Old Testament law in such controversial matters as obliging a man to marry his widowed sister-in-law upon his brother's death.<ref name=\"Meeder\">{{harvnb|Meeder|2011|pp=251\u201380}}</ref> Finally, a good example for the Irish tendency to adhere closely to the Old Testament is the [[Collectio canonum Hibernensis|''Hibernensis'']], a late 7th- or early 8th-century Irish canon law collection which was the first text of church law to draw heavily on the Bible, and in particular the Old Testament, at a time when Christians were meant to be \"dead to the old law\" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+7%3A4&version=NIV Romans 7:4]). In Scotland similar accusations surround the supposed [[Scottish pork taboo|cultural taboo concerning pork]].\n\n==Celtic Christian revivalism==\n{{See also|Neo-Celtic Christianity}}\n[[Ian Bradley]] notes that the recurrent interest in medieval insular Christianity has led to successive [[revival movement]]s he terms \"Celtic Christian revivalism\". According to Bradley, most, though not all, revivalists are non-Celts for whom Celtic Christianity has an \"exotic and peripheral\" appeal.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|pp=viii\u2013ix}}</ref> Adherents typically claim their revivals restore authentic practices and traits, though Bradley notes they reflect contemporary concerns and prejudices much more closely, and most are \"at least partially inspired and driven by denominational and national rivalries, ecclesiastical and secular power politics, and an anti-Roman Catholic agenda.\" Though often inaccurate or distorted, the beliefs of these movements have greatly influenced popular conceptions of historical Celtic Christianity.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|p=ix}}</ref>\n\nBradley traces the origins of Celtic Christian revivalism to the Middle Ages. In the 8th and 9th century, authors wrote idealised [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of earlier saints, whose \"golden age\" of extraordinary holiness contrasted with the perceived corruption of later times. Similarly, the 12th- and 13th-century [[Renaissance of the 12th century|literary revival]] popularised and romanticised older Celtic traditions such as the [[Arthurian legend]]. These ideas were expanded during the [[English Reformation]], as Protestant authors appropriated the concept of a \"Celtic Church\" as a native, anti-Roman predecessor to their own movement.<ref name=Bradleyviii>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|p=viii}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, [[antiquarian]]ism, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement, and growing nationalism influenced ideas about what was becoming known as \"Celtic Christianity\". Beginning in the early 20th century, a full-fledged revival movement began, centred on the island of [[Iona]] and influenced by the [[Irish Literary Revival]] and more general Christian revivals. By the end of the 20th century, another wave of enthusiasm began, this time influenced by [[New Age]] ideals.<ref name=Bradleyviii/> Today, a self-identification with and use of \"Celtic Christianity\" is common in countries such as [[Religion in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], both among participants in established churches and independent groups.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gierek |first=Bozena |chapter=Celtic spirituality in contemporary Ireland |pages=300\u2013317 |editor1-first=Olivia |editor1-last=Cosgrove |editor2-first=Laurence |editor2-last=Cox |editor3-first=Carmen |editor3-last=Kuhling |editor4-first=Peter |editor4-last=Mulholland |title=Ireland's new religious movements: Alternative Spiritualities, Migrant Religions, the New Age and New Religious Movements |location=Newcastle upon Tyne |publisher=Cambridge Scholars |date=2011 |oclc=758707463 |isbn=978-1-4438-2588-7 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Wales|Cornwall}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ancient Celtic religion]]\n* [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity]]\n* [[History of Ireland (400\u2013800)]]\n* [[History of Christianity in Ireland]]\n* [[Ancient British Church]] (part of the \"neo-Celtic Christian\" restoration movement of 19th century origin)\n* [[Celtic Orthodox Church]]\n* [[Celtic Christian traditions in Gwynedd until 1100]]\n* [[Christianity in Ireland]]\n* [[David Adam (priest)]]\n* [[Gallican Rite]]\n* [[Gregorian Reform]]\n* [[Papar]]\n* [[Quartodecimanism]]\n* [[Richard Williams Morgan]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Primary sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |author=Adomnan |title=Life of Columba |editor1-first=A.O. |editor1-last=Anderson |editor2-first=M.O. |editor2-last=Anderson |edition=2nd |publisher=Oxford Medieval Texts |date=1991 }}\n* {{cite book |title=Annales Cambriae |editor-first=John |editor-last=Williams |location=London |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts |date=1860 |url=https://archive.org/details/annalescambriae00willgoog |via=Internet Archive }}\n* {{cite book |author=Bede |title=Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Angelorum |series=Venerabilis Baedae Opera Historica |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Plummer |location=Oxonii |publisher=E Typographeo Clarendoniano |date=1896 |url=https://archive.org/details/historiamecclesi02bedeuoft |via=Internet Archive }}\n* {{cite book |author=Cummian |title=De controversia paschali and De ratione conputandi |editor1-first=Maura |editor1-last=Walsh |editor2-first=D\u00e1ibh\u00ed |editor2-last=\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn |editor2-link=D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn |location=Toronto |publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies |date=1988 |pages=93\u20135 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Gildas |title=De Excidio Brittaniae |editor-first=J.A. |editor-last=Giles |editor-link=J.
