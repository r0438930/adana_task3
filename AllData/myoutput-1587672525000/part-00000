It crashed into a field in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], during an attempt by the passengers and crew to regain control. All 44 people on board were killed, including the four hijackers, but no one on the ground was injured. The aircraft involved, a [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757\u2013222]], was flying [[United Airlines]]' daily scheduled morning flight from [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark International Airport]] in [[New Jersey]] to [[San Francisco International Airport]] in [[California]].\n\nThe hijackers stormed the aircraft's cockpit 46 minutes after takeoff. The pilot and first officer took measures, such as de-activating the autopilot, to hinder the hijackers. [[Ziad Jarrah]], who had trained as a pilot, took control of the aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of [[Washington, D.C.]], the U.S. capital. [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] and [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], considered principal instigators of the attacks, have claimed that the intended target was the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol Building]].<ref>\"'We Have Some Planes'\". 9/11 Commission Report.

Many of the passengers then attempted to regain control of the aircraft from the hijackers.

The exact time at which Flight&nbsp;93 came under the hijackers' control cannot be determined.

Dahl and Homer took actions to interfere with the hijackers, including disengaging the autopilot just before the hijackers took over in order to prevent them from aiming the plane at Washington, D.C., and switching the output of the pilots' microphones from the cabin address speakers to the radio transmitter so that Jarrah's attempts to communicate with the passengers would instead be heard by air traffic controllers.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\">{{cite news|last=Gonzales|first=Manny|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2006/04/12/flight-93-tape-horror-heroics/|title=Flight 93 tape: Horror, heroics|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=May 8, 2016}}</ref> Dahl \"stayed in the cockpit alone with the hijacker-pilot, injured but not dead\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1838257 |title=Flight 93 Pilot's Wife Recalls Terror of Recording |date=April 13, 2006 |publisher=ABC News}}</ref> while Homer was \"knocked unconscious and dragged from the cockpit\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe flight transcript suggests that at least two hijackers were in the cockpit.

It crashed into a field in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], during an attempt by the passengers and crew to regain control. All 44 people on board were killed, including the four hijackers, but no one on the ground was injured. The aircraft involved, a [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757\u2013222]], was flying [[United Airlines]]' daily scheduled morning flight from [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark International Airport]] in [[New Jersey]] to [[San Francisco International Airport]] in [[California]].\n\nThe hijackers stormed the aircraft's cockpit 46 minutes after takeoff. The pilot and first officer took measures, such as de-activating the autopilot, to hinder the hijackers. [[Ziad Jarrah]], who had trained as a pilot, took control of the aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of [[Washington, D.C.]], the U.S. capital. [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] and [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], considered principal instigators of the attacks, have claimed that the intended target was the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol Building]].<ref>\"'We Have Some Planes'\". 9/11 Commission Report.

Many of the passengers then attempted to regain control of the aircraft from the hijackers.
