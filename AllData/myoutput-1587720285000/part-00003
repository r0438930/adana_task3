With 147 professional victories,<ref>{{cite web |title=Bernard Hinault wins |url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/bernard-hinault/statistics/wins |publisher=ProCyclingStats |accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref> including five in the [[Tour de France]], he is often named among the greatest cyclists of all time.\n\nHinault started cycling as an amateur in his native [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]. After a successful amateur career, he signed with the [[Gitane\u2013Campagnolo]] team to turn professional in 1975. He took breakthrough victories at both the [[1977 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] classic and the [[1977 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] stage race in 1977. In 1978, he won his first two [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]: the [[1978 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and the [[1978 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. In the following years, he was the most successful professional cyclist, adding another Tour victory in [[1979 Tour de France|1979]] and a win at the [[1980 Giro d'Italia]]. Although a knee injury forced him to quit the [[1980 Tour de France]] while in the lead, he returned to win the [[1980 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championship road race]] later in the year. He added another Tour victory in [[1981 Tour de France|1981]], before completing his first Giro-Tour double in 1982.\n\nAfter winning the [[1983 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]], a return of his knee problems forced him to miss that year's [[1983 Tour de France|Tour de France]], won by his teammate [[Laurent Fignon]]. Tensions within the [[Renault (cycling team)|Renault team]] led to his leaving and joining [[La Vie Claire]]. With his new team, he raced the [[1984 Tour de France]], being comprehensively beaten by Fignon. He recovered the following year, winning another Giro-Tour double with the help of teammate [[Greg LeMond]]. In the [[1986 Tour de France]], he engaged in an intra-team rivalry with LeMond, who won his first of three Tours. Hinault retired shortly thereafter. {{As of|2019}} he was the most recent French winner of the Tour de France. After his cycling career, Hinault turned to farming, while fulfilling representative duties for the organisers of the Tour de France until 2016.\n\nAll through his career, Hinault was known by the nickname ''le blaireau'' (\"the badger\"); he associated himself with the animal due to its aggressive nature, a trait he embodied on the bike. Within the [[peloton]] (the field of riders), Hinault assumed the role of ''patron'', exercising authority over races he took part in.\n\n==Early life and family==\nHinault was born on 14 November 1954 in the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Breton]] village of [[Yffiniac]], the second oldest of four children to Joseph and Lucie Hinault. The family lived in a cottage named La Cl\u00f4ture, built shortly after Hinault was born. His parents were farmers, and the children often had to help out at harvest time.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=21\u201324}} His father later worked as a [[platelayer]] for the national rail company [[SNCF]].{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=6}} Hinault was described as a \"hyperactive\" child, with his mother nicknaming him \"little [[hooligan]]\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=21\u201324}} Hinault was not a good student, but visited the technical college in [[Saint-Brieuc]] for an engineering apprenticeship. He started athletics there, becoming a runner and finishing tenth in the French junior cross-country championship in 1971.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=26\u201327}}\n\nIn December 1974, just before turning professional, Hinault married Martine, who he had met at a family wedding the year before.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=61\u201362}} Their first son, Mickael, was born in 1975,{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=68}} with a second, Alexandre, in 1981.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=150}} Hinault and his family lived in [[Quessoy]], close to Yffiniac, while he was a professional cyclist. After his retirement, they moved to a farm {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} away in Brittany.<ref name=tourdeforce>{{cite news |last1=Abt |first1=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Abt | title=Biking's Tour de Force |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/magazine/biking-s-tour-de-force.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 January 2019 |date=26 June 1983}}</ref> Hinault had bought the {{convert|48|ha|abbr=on}} property near [[Calorguen]] in 1983.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=304}} Martine later served as mayor of Calorguen.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=306}}\n\n==Amateur career==\n{{quote box|quote=\"It seemed natural to him that he had won.\"<br /> Hinault's mother Lucie speaking about his reaction after his first race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=32}}|width=20%|align=left}}\nHinault came to cycling through his cousin Ren\u00e9, who rode weekend races. At first he had to use the shared family bike, which he rode devotedly. He received his own bike when he was 15 as a reward for passing his school examinations, and used it to travel to college. During the summer of 1971 he made training rides with Ren\u00e9, who had problems keeping up with the sixteen-year old Bernard, even though he was an experienced amateur rider. Hinault received his racing licence from Club Olympique Briochin in late April{{nbsp}}1971 and entered his first race on 2{{nbsp}}May in [[Planguenoual]]. Advised only to try to stay with the other riders, Hinault won the event.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=28\u201331}} Hinault won his first five races, amassing twelve wins from twenty races by the end of the year.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=32}} Also during the summer of 1971, Hinault was at odds with his father about his choice to pursue cycling as a career. Joseph Hinault relented only after his son ran away from home for three days to stay with his cousins, sleeping on straw in the barn.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=34}}\n\nFor 1972, Hinault was allowed to race with the over-18s. At a race in [[Hillion]], he and Ren\u00e9 escaped from the field and reached the finish alone. They crossed the line together to share the victory, to the dismay of the race organisers.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=37\u201338}} The young Hinault was heavily influenced by his trainer at the Club Olympique Briochin, Robert Le Roux, who had earlier worked with [[1965 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|1965 World Champion]] [[Tom Simpson]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=45}} Hinault won nineteen races in his second season as an amateur, including the national junior championship against opposition a year older than him, such as future professional [[Bernard Vallet]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=11}} He was conscripted into the military at age 18, and did not race throughout 1973. He was unable to join the army's training centre for young athletes and instead served in [[Sissonne]] with the [[21st Marine Infantry Regiment]].{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=11}} Returning to competition overweight, Hinault managed to win his first race of 1974. This was his last season as an amateur and again was highly successful, including a victory in his home town of Yffiniac towards the end of the year, where an alliance formed by four other riders was unable to hold him back. He also competed in [[track cycling]], winning the national [[Individual pursuit|pursuit]] championship.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=52\u201354}} On the road, he took part in the [[\u00c9toile des Espoirs]], a race open to amateurs and young professionals. Hinault finished fifth overall, and second on the time trial stage behind [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships \u2013 Men's individual pursuit|reigning pursuit world champion]] [[Roy Schuiten]]. Towards the end of the season, Hinault turned down an offer to race with the prestigious [[Athletic Club de Boulogne-Billancourt]], instead deciding to turn professional in 1975.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=55\u201356}}\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n=== 1975\u20131977: Gitane ===\nIn January 1975, Hinault turned professional with the [[Gitane\u2013Campagnolo]] team, run by [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|former World Champion]] [[Jean Stablinski]], on a lean wage of 2,500{{nbsp}}[[French franc|francs]] per month. The decision to turn professional relatively early was in part taken as, had Hinault raced the 1975 season as an amateur, he would have likely been prevented by the French cycling federation from turning professional before the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] to be part of the [[France at the 1976 Summer Olympics|French team there]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=60\u201361}} Early on, he showed no interest in adhering to the unwritten rules of the peloton, whereby younger riders were expected to show respect towards older ones. At a [[Criterium|criterium race]] in August{{nbsp}}1975 he went up against a coalition of senior riders, who had decided to divide the prize money between them. Hinault won all the intermediate cash prizes until five-time [[Tour de France]] winner [[Eddy Merckx]] declared that Hinault was included in the pact.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=58\u201360}} His results in his first season were impressive, with a seventh place [[1975 Paris\u2013Nice|at Paris\u2013Nice]] and a victory at the [[Circuit de la Sarthe (cycling)|Circuit de la Sarthe]], earning him the Promotion Pernod, the prize for the best new professional in France.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=63\u201364}} However, Hinault showed little willingness to learn the basic trades of cycling from Stablinski, often escaping early in the race instead of learning how to ride inside the peloton. Together with Stablinski entering Hinault into too many races, this led to conflicts between them.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=66\u201368}}\n\nFor 1976, Hinault stayed with Gitane, as former professional [[Cyrille Guimard]], who had just retired from cycling, took over the team and became ''[[directeur sportif]]''. Guimard and Hinault got along well, and the latter was kept out of the high-profile races for 1976, instead focussing on a steady improvement in lesser known races such as [[Paris\u2013Camembert]], which he won. That year, Guimard spurred [[Lucien Van Impe]] to his only win in the Tour de France.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=69\u201375}} Hinault's progress was visible, with a second consecutive victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe, a third place at the [[Grand Prix du Midi Libre]] and a win at the Tour de l'Aude, ensuring him the Prestige Pernod, the award for the best French rider of the season.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=76}} In total, Hinault won 15 races in 1976. At the end of the year, he came sixth at the [[1976 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championship Road Race]], being beaten to the line for fifth by Eddy Merckx.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=18}}\n\nDuring the [[Classic cycle races|spring classics]] season of 1977, Hinault left the [[1977 Tour of Flanders|Tour of Flanders]] before it had even started, not wanting to risk his health in a rain- and cold-affected race on cobbled roads. This drew him a formal warning by Guimard for his conduct. Three weeks later, Hinault won [[1977 Gent\u2013Wevelgem|Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] in a solo effort after an attack {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=22}} Five days later, at [[1977 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]], Hinault followed an attack by favourite [[Andr\u00e9 Dierickx]], and beat him in the two-man sprint to take his first victory in one of cycling's \"[[Cycling monument|monuments]]\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=78\u201379}} In accordance with Guimard's plan to build Hinault up slowly, he did not enter the [[1977 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. He did however start the [[1977 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], seen as the most important preparation event for the Tour. While in the leader's jersey on the penultimate stage to [[Grenoble]], Hinault attacked up the [[Col de Porte]], leading Van Impe and [[Bernard Th\u00e9venet]] by 1:30 minutes when crossing the summit. On the descent, he misjudged a [[hairpin turn|hairpin corner]] and crashed down the mountainside. A tree saved him from falling far down, while his bike was lost. Hinault then climbed back onto the road, took a new bike and without showing any hesitation, continued on. Up the finishing climb in Grenoble, he briefly dismounted, still shocked from the near-death experience and pushed his bike for about {{convert|20|m|yd|abbr=on}}, before remounting and winning the stage eighty seconds ahead of Van Impe. This also secured him the overall victory ahead of eventual Tour winner Th\u00e9venet.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=80\u201381}} \n\nThis incident was mentioned from a semi-pro rider's perspective in the [[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] book De Runner (The Rider) when the main character is about to descend a Col in the [[Mont Aigoual|Tour de Mont Aigoual]]: {{quote|Curves. I'm afraid, and for good reason. Only three weeks ago, during the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, the young up-and-coming Hinault flew out of a curve, into a ravine. Gone. At that moment the French TV audience had every reason to assume that he was lying down there with a broken back. Then he climbed up, was given another bike, rode on, won the stage and went on to win the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9. A star for ever. Hinault had gone into that ravine a rider, but came out a vedette, and the entire operation lasted no longer than fifteen seconds.\"<ref>{{cite book| title= The Rider|first1=Tim |last1=Krabb\u00e9 |page= 47|isbn=9781582342900|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London}}</ref>}}\n\nAt the end of the season, Hinault won the [[Grand Prix des Nations]], an [[individual time trial]], with a substantial margin of 3:15 minutes ahead of favourite [[Joop Zoetemelk]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=91}}\n\n=== 1978\u20131983: Renault ===\n====1978: Grand Tour breakthrough====\n[[File:Bernard Hinault 1978 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hinault at the [[1978 Tour de France]]|alt=Black-and-white photo of Hinault in a cycling jersey, smiling and lifting his right arm in the air]]\nAt the beginning of 1978, the Gitane team was taken over by its parent company, the state-owned car manufacturer [[Renault]], becoming {{ct|REN|1978}}.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=105}} Hinault started the season with second place at [[1978 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]].

Trailing [[Raymond Martin (cyclist)|Raymond Martin]] by more than two minutes before the final {{convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}} time trial, he made up his significant deficit and won the event.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=92}}\n\nHinault then competed in his first three-week [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]], at the [[1978 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]], then held at the end of April.{{efn|Since 1995, the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] is held in late August\u2013early September.<ref>{{cite web |title=Did the Vuelta's date change hurt the race? |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/did-the-vueltas-date-change-hurt-the-race/ |website=cyclingnews.com |accessdate=5 August 2019 |date=27 February 2008}}</ref>}} He won the opening prologue time trial in [[Gij\u00f3n]], but then let the leadership switch to [[Ferdi Van Den Haute]]. He won stage 11b, a mountain time trial in [[Barcelona]], and regained the race lead the next day, when he won the stage to [[Santa Margarida de Montbui|La Tossa de Montbui]] after an escape with teammate [[Jean-Ren\u00e9 Bernaudeau]]. He ensured his overall victory by winning stage 18 to [[Amurrio]]. On that stage, he bridged over to escapee [[Andr\u00e9s Gandarias]], who had earlier asked for Hinault's permission to attack. Hinault claimed to have been annoyed into attacking by one of Gandarias's teammates and offered to carry him to the finish. However, the Spaniard was unable to follow his wheel, saying: \"This guy has made me suffer like a dog, he's tougher than Eddy Merckx!\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=93\u201395}} In all, Hinault won five stages of the Vuelta. A sixth win was prevented on the final day of the Grand Tour, on which a short time trial was raced in the afternoon, held at [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. The stage was marred by protests and obstructions by supporters of the Basque separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. Hinault himself had sand thrown into his eyes, but won the stage nonetheless, only to find that the results would not count due to the surrounding circumstances.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|pages=35\u201341}}\n\nAhead of his first Tour de France, Hinault raced in the [[1978 Tour de Suisse|Tour de Suisse]], where he did not feature prominently. He then travelled to the [[French National Road Race Championships|French Road Race Championship]], held at [[Sarrebourg]]. He launched an escape, on which he rode {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} solo, leading the rest of his competitors by more than six minutes by the start of the last lap. However, he had forgotten to eat enough and suffered from [[hypoglycemia]] during the last part of the race, crossing the finish line to take the title severely weakened. His victory allowed him to wear the French ''[[Flag of France|tricolore]]'' jersey for the following year.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=97}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"He marched forward like [[Napoleon]].

The riders had been complaining about split stages, where more than one would be held on one day, as was the case on 12{{nbsp}}July. When they reached the finishing town, they dismounted their bikes and walked to the finish line in protest. Hinault was chosen by his fellow competitors to be the spokesperson of the strike. Journalist Felix Magowan wrote: \"Before today's strike, people were asking if the Tour had a boss. Today that was answered. His name is Hinault.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=85\u201391}} Following the strike, Hinault had trouble sleeping and was caught out the next day, a stage in the [[Massif Central]], forcing his team into a long chase. Thus weakened and slowed by spectator interference at a bike change, he lost 1:40 minutes to Zoetemelk on the following day's uphill time trial.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=115}} Hinault countered the next day ''en route'' to [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]] during stage 15, breaking away with [[Hennie Kuiper]]. By the finish, the two had been reeled back, but Hinault contested the finishing sprint, winning the stage. The following day, stage 16 to [[Alpe d'Huez]], ended with Zoetemelk, Hinault and the temporary leader of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]] and thus yellow jersey wearer [[Michel Pollentier]] separated by only 18 seconds. However, Pollentier was disqualified for trying to cheat his [[doping in sport|doping]] test, leaving Hinault and Zoetemelk to fight out the overall victory. On the final mountain stage, Hinault put his rival under pressure, but was unable to make up any time. He then clinched the yellow jersey in the final time trial, gaining more than four minutes to win his first Tour de France with an advantage of 3:56 minutes.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=100\u2013102}} Following his Tour win, he finished fifth at the [[1978 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championships]], before once more winning the Grand Prix des Nations, this time ahead of [[Francesco Moser]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=103}}\n\n====1979: Second Tour victory and Classics success====\nThe 1979 season started slowly for an off-form Hinault. He bounced back at the [[1979 La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne|La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne]] classic in April, when he caught up to a breakaway by [[Giuseppe Saronni]] and [[Bernt Johansson]], outsprinting the former to win the race. He then beat Zoetemelk to victory at the [[1979 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], winning four stages. He won the race by over ten minutes, also taking the [[Points classification|points]] and [[King of the Mountains|mountain classifications]]. In the coming weeks ahead of the Tour, he proved his willingness to assist his teammates to ensure their loyalty, helping [[Lucien Didier]] win the [[Tour de Luxembourg]] and finishing second behind [[Roland Berland]] in the National Championship race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=117\u2013118}}\n[[File:Joop Zoetemelk, Bestanddeelnr 930-4019.jpg|thumb|[[Joop Zoetemelk]] ''(pictured in 1979)'' was Hinault's strongest competitor during his first [[Tour de France]] victories.|alt=Black-and-white photograph of Zoetemelk, wearing cycling gear]]\nThe [[1979 Tour de France|Tour de France]] was again a two-way battle between Hinault and Zoetemelk. In the prologue, Hinault was fourth, on the same time as the Dutchman. The mountain stages started immediately thereafter, with Hinault winning the mountain time trial on stage 2, taking over the yellow jersey. He also won the next stage into [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. The team time trial on stage{{nbsp}}4 again went Zoetemelk's way, as his Mercier team took back 41 seconds on Hinault's Renault squad. Zoetemelk now was only 12 seconds behind Hinault. On stage 8, in another team time trial, Renault fared much better, and Hinault extended his advantage to 1:18 minutes. The next day however, on a stage containing [[Cobblestone#Use in cycling|cobbled sections]], Hinault suffered two [[Flat tire#Bicycles|punctures]], losing almost four minutes and the race lead to Zoetemelk.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=119}} He took back 36 seconds on the time trial in [[Brussels]] on stage 11 before regaining the race lead after another time trial, uphill to [[Avoriaz]] on stage 15. At this stage, he led Zoetemelk by 1:48 minutes, with third-placed Kuiper already more than 12 minutes behind. Hinault gained another minute on stage 16, before Zoetemelk regained 47 seconds up Alpe d'Huez three days later. The final time trial of the Tour went Hinault's way once again, extending his advantage by a further 69 seconds. He also took the next stage in a slightly uphill sprint finish.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=119\u2013122}} On the final stage towards the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in [[Paris]], traditionally [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage in the Tour de France|a ceremonious affair without attacks]], Zoetemelk and Hinault broke away, with both gapping the field and Hinault taking another stage victory. Zoetemelk finished 3:07 minutes behind Hinault, but then had ten minutes added to his time for failing a doping test. The next finisher, [[Joaquim Agostinho]], was almost half an hour behind the winner.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=114\u2013116}}\n\nTowards the end of the season, Hinault won his second cycling monument, the [[1979 Giro di Lombardia|Giro di Lombardia]]. He had escaped from the field {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, but was later joined by some other riders. Only [[Silvano Contini]] finished with him, with the next group more than three minutes behind. The victory also secured that Hinault won his first of four consecutive [[Super Prestige Pernod International]] competitions, the award handed to the best rider of the season.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=123\u2013124}}\n\n====1980: Attempt at the Triple Crown====\nAs was often the case, Hinault started the season slowly in 1980, withdrawing from [[1980 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=129}} He then entered [[1980 Paris\u2013Roubaix|Paris\u2013Roubaix]], partly to prepare for the cobbled sections in the upcoming Tour de France, and finished fourth.{{sfn|Moore|2014|p=25}} A week later, he scored one of his most memorable wins at [[1980 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]]. As soon as the riders left [[Li\u00e8ge]], snow began to fall, soon turning into a blizzard. Hinault wanted to abandon, as had many others, including all but one of his teammates. He was convinced to carry on until the feeding station at [[Bastogne]], where the snow had turned into rain. Only 21 riders were left by this point. Hinault removed his rain cape and attacked, catching up to the leaders and carried on by himself, winning with a margin of almost ten minutes ahead of Kuiper. The victory came at a price, as his right index and middle fingers took weeks to recover from [[frostbite]], and caused him pain for several years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge's cold memories |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/liege-bastogne-lieges-cold-memories/ |website=[[Cyclingnews.com]] |accessdate=16 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816165809/http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/liege-bastogne-lieges-cold-memories/ |archivedate=16 August 2018 |date=23 April 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHinault and Guimard then turned their attention to the only Grand Tour he had not won yet: the [[Giro d'Italia]].

Following a fourth place at the prologue in [[Genoa]], Hinault made a spontaneous visit to [[Fausto Coppi]]'s home of [[Castellania, Piedmont|Castellania]], paying respect to the first rider ever to have won Giro and Tour in the same year. On stage 5, a time trial to [[Pisa]], Hinault took over the race leader's [[pink jersey]]. He then relinquished his lead to [[Roberto Visentini]], who was not considered to be a contender for the final victory. On stage 14, he attacked when the peloton relaxed after an intermediate sprint, winning the stage ahead of [[Wladimiro Panizza]], who took the race lead. Hinault then made the decisive move of the race on stage 20, when he attacked on the tough climb of the [[Stelvio Pass]]. He caught up with his teammate Bernaudeau, and both carried on for the remaining {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the stage together. Hinault gifted the stage victory to his teammate, while he clinched the overall victory almost six minutes ahead of Panizza.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=131\u2013134}}\n\nIn the [[1980 Tour de France|Tour de France]], Hinault was once again set to duel with Joop Zoetemelk, who had moved to the dominant {{ct|TIR|1980}} squad. Hinault won the prologue in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, five seconds ahead of [[Gerrie Knetemann]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=134}} On stage{{nbsp}}5 from Li\u00e8ge to [[Lille]], which contained cobbled sections used in [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]], conditions were poor with rain and heavy winds. Hinault called for the field to take a slow tempo, but when Zoetemelk's teammate [[Jan Raas]] attacked, he went after him. He eventually found himself in a group with several other riders, while Zoetemelk was distanced. At {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, he followed another attack from Kuiper and won the sprint at the line. The next stage was set to contain more cobbled roads, but on Hinault's protest, most of the worst parts were taken out. Hinault had however suffered damage to his left knee on the stage to Lille.{{sfn|Moore|2014|pages=27\u201331}} Hinault finished only fifth on stage 11's individual time trial, won by Zoetemelk.

In the ensuing fist fight, Hinault suffered a broken rib.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=199\u2013201}}\n\nThe [[1984 Tour de France|Tour de France]] was made out to be the big duel between Hinault and Fignon, who had just won the French National Championship.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=230\u2013231}}{{sfn|Moore|2014|p=133}} Hinault won the prologue, but Renault took the team time trial, 55 seconds ahead of La Vie Claire. He lost another 49 seconds to Fignon in the first long individual time trial, a discipline he had previously dominated. Following the second time trial, Hinault was only seventh on general classification, two minutes behind his adversary. The next stage led to Alpe d'Huez. Hinault attacked on the [[Rampe de Laffrey]], but Fignon was able to respond. The two exchanged attacks on the way up the climb, but it was in the valley that Hinault was able to draw out a gap of about a minute. On Alpe d'Huez itself, he was first passed by eventual stage winner [[Luis Herrera (cyclist)|Luis Herrera]]. When he started to slow, Fignon caught up to him and eventually dropped Hinault, who lost a further three minutes. He ultimately finished the Tour in second place, a significant ten minutes behind Fignon.{{sfn|Moore|2014|pages=133\u2013140}}\n\nHinaut managed to bounce back from his Tour defeat in the fall. In late September, he took his fifth and final victory at the Grand Prix des Nations, riding the {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} time trial at a then record speed of {{convert|44.19|kph|mph|abbr=on}}. Fignon could only manage fourth, more than two minutes behind. Next, he won the [[Trofeo Baracchi]], a two-man time trial, in which he competed with Moser. He then won the [[1984 Giro di Lombardia|Giro di Lombardia]] for a second time, breaking away from the group of favourites {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=251\u2013253}}\n\n====1985: The second Giro-Tour double====\nFor 1985, Greg LeMond switched teams from Renault to join Hinault at La Vie Claire.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=138}} Together, they entered the [[1985 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]]. During the race, Hinault was met with hostility from the home crowd, who supported local rider Francesco Moser. On the stage 12 time trial, Hinault took the pink jersey and opened the decisive gap to Moser, who would eventually finish second. During the stage however, Hinault was spat at by spectators and almost knocked over, even though his team car rode behind him with the door opened the entire time to ensure that bystanders would have a harder time impeding him. Hinault won his third Giro with a margin of just over a minute.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=254\u2013255}}\n\nIn the [[1985 Tour de France|Tour de France]], Fignon did not take part due to an Achilles heel injury. Hinault therefore entered the race as the favourite. He took victory in the prologue in his native [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]. La Vie Claire won the stage{{nbsp}}3 team time trial by over a minute. The next day, Hinault's teammate [[Kim Andersen (cyclist)|Kim Andersen]] took over the yellow jersey. Hinault supported him over the next days, even going so far as dropping back when Andersen punctured to lead him back into the peloton, showing his loyalty to riders who would later have to assist him. On stage 8, a time trial to [[Strasbourg]], Hinault took back the race lead, winning the stage by more than two minutes ahead of [[Stephen Roche]]. While the race travelled through the Alps and in a second time trial, he consolidated his lead, building an advantage of five-and-a-half minutes on LeMond, who was now second overall.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=150\u2013160}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it.

On stage 17, he showed signs of weakness and was unable to stay with the other leaders on the [[Col du Tourmalet]]. LeMond meanwhile followed an attack by Roche, but was forbidden by the team to cooperate to distance Hinault. LeMond would later claim that the team had deceived him by telling him that Hinault was closer behind than he actually was. Hinault eventually finished the stage just over a minute behind LeMond. The time LeMond waited may have been enough so that the two teammates would have contested the [[Maillot Jaune]] in the penultimate time trial. In the penultimate day's time trial, LeMond won the stage, but only five seconds ahead of Hinault, not enough to surpass him. This secured Hinault a record-equalling fifth Tour victory, by just under two minutes over his younger teammate. After the finish, he publicly pledged that he would support LeMond's bid for a first Tour victory the following year.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=150\u2013160}}\n\n====1986: The final season====\n[[File:Hautes-Alpes Col De L'Izoard Tour De France Hinault 071986 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Hinault climbing the [[Col d'Izoard]] during the [[1986 Tour de France]].

The pair gained more than four-and-a-half minutes on LeMond, with Delgado taking the stage win. Hinault was now in the lead of the general classification, 5:25 minutes ahead of LeMond.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=209\u2013211}} Even though his lead was significant, he attacked again the following day, on the descent of the Col du Tourmalet, the first climb of the day. By the top of the next climb, the [[Col d'Aspin]], he led the rest of the field by two minutes. However, joint effort behind brought him back before the final ascent up to the ski station of [[Superbagn\u00e8res]]. Hinault then cracked, coming in ninth, 4:39 minutes behind stage winner LeMond. He now led his teammate by only forty seconds in the general classification.<ref name=tenstages/>\n\nThe race then moved over to the Alps.

Hinault attacked repeatedly, but reached the bottom of Alpe d'Huez with LeMond. He led the way up the climb, lined by approximately 300,000 spectators and crossed the finish line hand in hand with LeMond, in an apparent display of comradery. [[Urs Zimmermann]], who had been second overall at the start of the day, lost more than five minutes.<ref name=alpedhuez/> Any signs of appeasement between the rivalling teammates was shattered by Hinault in a television interview shortly after the stage finish, when he declared that the race was not yet over, even though he trailed LeMond by 2:45 minutes.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=255\u2013258}}\n\nStage 20 saw the final time trial and the last chance for Hinault to overcome LeMond's advantage.

His biographer [[William Fotheringham]] has described him as \"the last of the sport's ''patrons''\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=11}} In this role, Hinault would use his influence with race organisers, control the pace of the peloton, and allow or refuse other riders the chance to attack. The riders' strike at Valence d'Agen in the 1978 Tour is cited as the first instance in which Hinault assumed this role.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=11\u201312}} His fellow riders stated that he, even though he did not talk much, was able to exert a high amount of certainty and therefore strength, which brought him respect and sometimes fear from his competitors.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=159}} To signal his authority, Hinault often symbolically rode at the front of the field, instead of in the slipstream of his teammates.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=205\u2013206}} His riding style has been described as \"fighting, full of aggression\", and he stated that when he did not feel good in a race, his reaction would be to attack.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=111}} Hinault described his own role as follows:\n{{quote|You are like a soldier, a general who dominates, who imposes his will on the others.

He would often greet his training partners in a night gown when they arrived on time for training or have an easy day of training that included stops at a bakery for cake. His distaste for training became even more evident in the winter, when he would gain a lot of weight. Laurent Fignon described the first training camps of the year as follows: \"He looked as if he had been inflated. If you didn't know the Badger you would wonder how long it would take for him to get back to what he had been.

Le Guilloux used it once in front of Pierre Chany, a writer for ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'', and the name stuck.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=154\u2013155}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=21}} According to Hinault himself, the term in the first place was supposed to mean no more than \"mate\" or \"buddy\".{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=14}} However, Hinault later embraced the association with the wild animal. In 2003, he commented: \"A badger is a beautiful thing. When it's hunted it goes into its sett and waits. When it comes out again, it attacks. That's the reason for my nickname.

To counter this claim, Hinault replied: \"He must not know what it was like to ride without doping.\" Armstrong later clarified that he had spoken about the time when he was riding (1999\u20132005).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pretot |first1=Julien |title=Winning without doping was impossible: Armstrong |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-doping-armstrong-idUSBRE95R0QZ20130628 |accessdate=11 January 2019 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=28 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111110438/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-doping-armstrong-idUSBRE95R0QZ20130628 |archivedate=11 January 2019 |location=Porto Vecchio}}</ref> In early 2018, Hinault also spoke out about the adverse analytical result for [[salbutamol]] of four-time Tour winner [[Chris Froome]] at the [[2017 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]. He criticised Froome for taking part in the [[2018 Giro d'Italia]] while the investigation was still ongoing. In addition, he commented that Froome could not be \"listed among the cycling greats\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kelner |first1=Martha |title=Chris Froome should not be listed with cycling greats, says Hinault |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/chris-froome-cycling-bernard-hinault-giro-ditalia |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=11 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111110911/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/chris-froome-cycling-bernard-hinault-giro-ditalia |archivedate=11 January 2019 |date=30 May 2018}}</ref> Froome would win the Giro and become the first rider since Hinault to hold all three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]] Jerseys at once. Before the [[2018 Tour de France]], with Froome's case still ongoing, he urged the other riders to strike in protest if Froome competed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hinault calls for rider strike in protest

With 147 professional victories,<ref>{{cite web |title=Bernard Hinault wins |url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/bernard-hinault/statistics/wins |publisher=ProCyclingStats |accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref> including five in the [[Tour de France]], he is often named among the greatest cyclists of all time.\n\nHinault started cycling as an amateur in his native [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]. After a successful amateur career, he signed with the [[Gitane\u2013Campagnolo]] team to turn professional in 1975. He took breakthrough victories at both the [[1977 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] classic and the [[1977 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] stage race in 1977. In 1978, he won his first two [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]: the [[1978 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and the [[1978 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. In the following years, he was the most successful professional cyclist, adding another Tour victory in [[1979 Tour de France|1979]] and a win at the [[1980 Giro d'Italia]]. Although a knee injury forced him to quit the [[1980 Tour de France]] while in the lead, he returned to win the [[1980 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championship road race]] later in the year. He added another Tour victory in [[1981 Tour de France|1981]], before completing his first Giro-Tour double in 1982.\n\nAfter winning the [[1983 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]], a return of his knee problems forced him to miss that year's [[1983 Tour de France|Tour de France]], won by his teammate [[Laurent Fignon]]. Tensions within the [[Renault (cycling team)|Renault team]] led to his leaving and joining [[La Vie Claire]]. With his new team, he raced the [[1984 Tour de France]], being comprehensively beaten by Fignon. He recovered the following year, winning another Giro-Tour double with the help of teammate [[Greg LeMond]]. In the [[1986 Tour de France]], he engaged in an intra-team rivalry with LeMond, who won his first of three Tours. Hinault retired shortly thereafter. {{As of|2019}} he was the most recent French winner of the Tour de France. After his cycling career, Hinault turned to farming, while fulfilling representative duties for the organisers of the Tour de France until 2016.\n\nAll through his career, Hinault was known by the nickname ''le blaireau'' (\"the badger\"); he associated himself with the animal due to its aggressive nature, a trait he embodied on the bike. Within the [[peloton]] (the field of riders), Hinault assumed the role of ''patron'', exercising authority over races he took part in.\n\n==Early life and family==\nHinault was born on 14 November 1954 in the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Breton]] village of [[Yffiniac]], the second oldest of four children to Joseph and Lucie Hinault. The family lived in a cottage named La Cl\u00f4ture, built shortly after Hinault was born. His parents were farmers, and the children often had to help out at harvest time.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=21\u201324}} His father later worked as a [[platelayer]] for the national rail company [[SNCF]].{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=6}} Hinault was described as a \"hyperactive\" child, with his mother nicknaming him \"little [[hooligan]]\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=21\u201324}} Hinault was not a good student, but visited the technical college in [[Saint-Brieuc]] for an engineering apprenticeship. He started athletics there, becoming a runner and finishing tenth in the French junior cross-country championship in 1971.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=26\u201327}}\n\nIn December 1974, just before turning professional, Hinault married Martine, who he had met at a family wedding the year before.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=61\u201362}} Their first son, Mickael, was born in 1975,{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=68}} with a second, Alexandre, in 1981.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=150}} Hinault and his family lived in [[Quessoy]], close to Yffiniac, while he was a professional cyclist. After his retirement, they moved to a farm {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} away in Brittany.<ref name=tourdeforce>{{cite news |last1=Abt |first1=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Abt | title=Biking's Tour de Force |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/magazine/biking-s-tour-de-force.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 January 2019 |date=26 June 1983}}</ref> Hinault had bought the {{convert|48|ha|abbr=on}} property near [[Calorguen]] in 1983.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=304}} Martine later served as mayor of Calorguen.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=306}}\n\n==Amateur career==\n{{quote box|quote=\"It seemed natural to him that he had won.\"<br /> Hinault's mother Lucie speaking about his reaction after his first race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=32}}|width=20%|align=left}}\nHinault came to cycling through his cousin Ren\u00e9, who rode weekend races. At first he had to use the shared family bike, which he rode devotedly. He received his own bike when he was 15 as a reward for passing his school examinations, and used it to travel to college. During the summer of 1971 he made training rides with Ren\u00e9, who had problems keeping up with the sixteen-year old Bernard, even though he was an experienced amateur rider. Hinault received his racing licence from Club Olympique Briochin in late April{{nbsp}}1971 and entered his first race on 2{{nbsp}}May in [[Planguenoual]]. Advised only to try to stay with the other riders, Hinault won the event.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=28\u201331}} Hinault won his first five races, amassing twelve wins from twenty races by the end of the year.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=32}} Also during the summer of 1971, Hinault was at odds with his father about his choice to pursue cycling as a career. Joseph Hinault relented only after his son ran away from home for three days to stay with his cousins, sleeping on straw in the barn.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=34}}\n\nFor 1972, Hinault was allowed to race with the over-18s. At a race in [[Hillion]], he and Ren\u00e9 escaped from the field and reached the finish alone. They crossed the line together to share the victory, to the dismay of the race organisers.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=37\u201338}} The young Hinault was heavily influenced by his trainer at the Club Olympique Briochin, Robert Le Roux, who had earlier worked with [[1965 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|1965 World Champion]] [[Tom Simpson]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=45}} Hinault won nineteen races in his second season as an amateur, including the national junior championship against opposition a year older than him, such as future professional [[Bernard Vallet]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=11}} He was conscripted into the military at age 18, and did not race throughout 1973. He was unable to join the army's training centre for young athletes and instead served in [[Sissonne]] with the [[21st Marine Infantry Regiment]].{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=11}} Returning to competition overweight, Hinault managed to win his first race of 1974. This was his last season as an amateur and again was highly successful, including a victory in his home town of Yffiniac towards the end of the year, where an alliance formed by four other riders was unable to hold him back. He also competed in [[track cycling]], winning the national [[Individual pursuit|pursuit]] championship.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=52\u201354}} On the road, he took part in the [[\u00c9toile des Espoirs]], a race open to amateurs and young professionals. Hinault finished fifth overall, and second on the time trial stage behind [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships \u2013 Men's individual pursuit|reigning pursuit world champion]] [[Roy Schuiten]]. Towards the end of the season, Hinault turned down an offer to race with the prestigious [[Athletic Club de Boulogne-Billancourt]], instead deciding to turn professional in 1975.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=55\u201356}}\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n=== 1975\u20131977: Gitane ===\nIn January 1975, Hinault turned professional with the [[Gitane\u2013Campagnolo]] team, run by [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|former World Champion]] [[Jean Stablinski]], on a lean wage of 2,500{{nbsp}}[[French franc|francs]] per month. The decision to turn professional relatively early was in part taken as, had Hinault raced the 1975 season as an amateur, he would have likely been prevented by the French cycling federation from turning professional before the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] to be part of the [[France at the 1976 Summer Olympics|French team there]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=60\u201361}} Early on, he showed no interest in adhering to the unwritten rules of the peloton, whereby younger riders were expected to show respect towards older ones. At a [[Criterium|criterium race]] in August{{nbsp}}1975 he went up against a coalition of senior riders, who had decided to divide the prize money between them. Hinault won all the intermediate cash prizes until five-time [[Tour de France]] winner [[Eddy Merckx]] declared that Hinault was included in the pact.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=58\u201360}} His results in his first season were impressive, with a seventh place [[1975 Paris\u2013Nice|at Paris\u2013Nice]] and a victory at the [[Circuit de la Sarthe (cycling)|Circuit de la Sarthe]], earning him the Promotion Pernod, the prize for the best new professional in France.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=63\u201364}} However, Hinault showed little willingness to learn the basic trades of cycling from Stablinski, often escaping early in the race instead of learning how to ride inside the peloton. Together with Stablinski entering Hinault into too many races, this led to conflicts between them.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=66\u201368}}\n\nFor 1976, Hinault stayed with Gitane, as former professional [[Cyrille Guimard]], who had just retired from cycling, took over the team and became ''[[directeur sportif]]''. Guimard and Hinault got along well, and the latter was kept out of the high-profile races for 1976, instead focussing on a steady improvement in lesser known races such as [[Paris\u2013Camembert]], which he won. That year, Guimard spurred [[Lucien Van Impe]] to his only win in the Tour de France.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=69\u201375}} Hinault's progress was visible, with a second consecutive victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe, a third place at the [[Grand Prix du Midi Libre]] and a win at the Tour de l'Aude, ensuring him the Prestige Pernod, the award for the best French rider of the season.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=76}} In total, Hinault won 15 races in 1976. At the end of the year, he came sixth at the [[1976 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championship Road Race]], being beaten to the line for fifth by Eddy Merckx.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=18}}\n\nDuring the [[Classic cycle races|spring classics]] season of 1977, Hinault left the [[1977 Tour of Flanders|Tour of Flanders]] before it had even started, not wanting to risk his health in a rain- and cold-affected race on cobbled roads. This drew him a formal warning by Guimard for his conduct. Three weeks later, Hinault won [[1977 Gent\u2013Wevelgem|Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] in a solo effort after an attack {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=22}} Five days later, at [[1977 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]], Hinault followed an attack by favourite [[Andr\u00e9 Dierickx]], and beat him in the two-man sprint to take his first victory in one of cycling's \"[[Cycling monument|monuments]]\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=78\u201379}} In accordance with Guimard's plan to build Hinault up slowly, he did not enter the [[1977 Tour de France|Tour de France]]. He did however start the [[1977 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], seen as the most important preparation event for the Tour. While in the leader's jersey on the penultimate stage to [[Grenoble]], Hinault attacked up the [[Col de Porte]], leading Van Impe and [[Bernard Th\u00e9venet]] by 1:30 minutes when crossing the summit. On the descent, he misjudged a [[hairpin turn|hairpin corner]] and crashed down the mountainside. A tree saved him from falling far down, while his bike was lost. Hinault then climbed back onto the road, took a new bike and without showing any hesitation, continued on. Up the finishing climb in Grenoble, he briefly dismounted, still shocked from the near-death experience and pushed his bike for about {{convert|20|m|yd|abbr=on}}, before remounting and winning the stage eighty seconds ahead of Van Impe. This also secured him the overall victory ahead of eventual Tour winner Th\u00e9venet.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=80\u201381}} \n\nThis incident was mentioned from a semi-pro rider's perspective in the [[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] book De Runner (The Rider) when the main character is about to descend a Col in the [[Mont Aigoual|Tour de Mont Aigoual]]: {{quote|Curves. I'm afraid, and for good reason. Only three weeks ago, during the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, the young up-and-coming Hinault flew out of a curve, into a ravine. Gone. At that moment the French TV audience had every reason to assume that he was lying down there with a broken back. Then he climbed up, was given another bike, rode on, won the stage and went on to win the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9. A star for ever. Hinault had gone into that ravine a rider, but came out a vedette, and the entire operation lasted no longer than fifteen seconds.\"<ref>{{cite book| title= The Rider|first1=Tim |last1=Krabb\u00e9 |page= 47|isbn=9781582342900|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London}}</ref>}}\n\nAt the end of the season, Hinault won the [[Grand Prix des Nations]], an [[individual time trial]], with a substantial margin of 3:15 minutes ahead of favourite [[Joop Zoetemelk]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=91}}\n\n=== 1978\u20131983: Renault ===\n====1978: Grand Tour breakthrough====\n[[File:Bernard Hinault 1978 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hinault at the [[1978 Tour de France]]|alt=Black-and-white photo of Hinault in a cycling jersey, smiling and lifting his right arm in the air]]\nAt the beginning of 1978, the Gitane team was taken over by its parent company, the state-owned car manufacturer [[Renault]], becoming {{ct|REN|1978}}.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=105}} Hinault started the season with second place at [[1978 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]].

He ensured his overall victory by winning stage 18 to [[Amurrio]]. On that stage, he bridged over to escapee [[Andr\u00e9s Gandarias]], who had earlier asked for Hinault's permission to attack. Hinault claimed to have been annoyed into attacking by one of Gandarias's teammates and offered to carry him to the finish. However, the Spaniard was unable to follow his wheel, saying: \"This guy has made me suffer like a dog, he's tougher than Eddy Merckx!\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=93\u201395}} In all, Hinault won five stages of the Vuelta. A sixth win was prevented on the final day of the Grand Tour, on which a short time trial was raced in the afternoon, held at [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. The stage was marred by protests and obstructions by supporters of the Basque separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. Hinault himself had sand thrown into his eyes, but won the stage nonetheless, only to find that the results would not count due to the surrounding circumstances.{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|pages=35\u201341}}\n\nAhead of his first Tour de France, Hinault raced in the [[1978 Tour de Suisse|Tour de Suisse]], where he did not feature prominently. He then travelled to the [[French National Road Race Championships|French Road Race Championship]], held at [[Sarrebourg]]. He launched an escape, on which he rode {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} solo, leading the rest of his competitors by more than six minutes by the start of the last lap. However, he had forgotten to eat enough and suffered from [[hypoglycemia]] during the last part of the race, crossing the finish line to take the title severely weakened. His victory allowed him to wear the French ''[[Flag of France|tricolore]]'' jersey for the following year.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=97}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"He marched forward like [[Napoleon]].

On stage 8, the first longer individual time trial, Hinault gained back 59 seconds on Zoetemelk, while the previous two Tour winners, Van Impe and Th\u00e9venet, lost so much time that they were now counted out from chances of an overall win.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=113}} Hinault rode conservatively in the [[Pyrenees]] to stay within striking distance of Zoetemelk.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=98\u201399}} On stage 12a, from [[Tarbes]] to [[Valence-d'Agen]], he firmly imprinted his authority on the race, although not by riding. The riders had been complaining about split stages, where more than one would be held on one day, as was the case on 12{{nbsp}}July. When they reached the finishing town, they dismounted their bikes and walked to the finish line in protest. Hinault was chosen by his fellow competitors to be the spokesperson of the strike. Journalist Felix Magowan wrote: \"Before today's strike, people were asking if the Tour had a boss. Today that was answered. His name is Hinault.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=85\u201391}} Following the strike, Hinault had trouble sleeping and was caught out the next day, a stage in the [[Massif Central]], forcing his team into a long chase. Thus weakened and slowed by spectator interference at a bike change, he lost 1:40 minutes to Zoetemelk on the following day's uphill time trial.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=115}} Hinault countered the next day ''en route'' to [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]] during stage 15, breaking away with [[Hennie Kuiper]]. By the finish, the two had been reeled back, but Hinault contested the finishing sprint, winning the stage. The following day, stage 16 to [[Alpe d'Huez]], ended with Zoetemelk, Hinault and the temporary leader of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]] and thus yellow jersey wearer [[Michel Pollentier]] separated by only 18 seconds. However, Pollentier was disqualified for trying to cheat his [[doping in sport|doping]] test, leaving Hinault and Zoetemelk to fight out the overall victory. On the final mountain stage, Hinault put his rival under pressure, but was unable to make up any time. He then clinched the yellow jersey in the final time trial, gaining more than four minutes to win his first Tour de France with an advantage of 3:56 minutes.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=100\u2013102}} Following his Tour win, he finished fifth at the [[1978 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|World Championships]], before once more winning the Grand Prix des Nations, this time ahead of [[Francesco Moser]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=103}}\n\n====1979: Second Tour victory and Classics success====\nThe 1979 season started slowly for an off-form Hinault. He bounced back at the [[1979 La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne|La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne]] classic in April, when he caught up to a breakaway by [[Giuseppe Saronni]] and [[Bernt Johansson]], outsprinting the former to win the race. He then beat Zoetemelk to victory at the [[1979 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], winning four stages. He won the race by over ten minutes, also taking the [[Points classification|points]] and [[King of the Mountains|mountain classifications]]. In the coming weeks ahead of the Tour, he proved his willingness to assist his teammates to ensure their loyalty, helping [[Lucien Didier]] win the [[Tour de Luxembourg]] and finishing second behind [[Roland Berland]] in the National Championship race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=117\u2013118}}\n[[File:Joop Zoetemelk, Bestanddeelnr 930-4019.jpg|thumb|[[Joop Zoetemelk]] ''(pictured in 1979)'' was Hinault's strongest competitor during his first [[Tour de France]] victories.|alt=Black-and-white photograph of Zoetemelk, wearing cycling gear]]\nThe [[1979 Tour de France|Tour de France]] was again a two-way battle between Hinault and Zoetemelk. In the prologue, Hinault was fourth, on the same time as the Dutchman. The mountain stages started immediately thereafter, with Hinault winning the mountain time trial on stage 2, taking over the yellow jersey. He also won the next stage into [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. The team time trial on stage{{nbsp}}4 again went Zoetemelk's way, as his Mercier team took back 41 seconds on Hinault's Renault squad. Zoetemelk now was only 12 seconds behind Hinault. On stage 8, in another team time trial, Renault fared much better, and Hinault extended his advantage to 1:18 minutes. The next day however, on a stage containing [[Cobblestone#Use in cycling|cobbled sections]], Hinault suffered two [[Flat tire#Bicycles|punctures]], losing almost four minutes and the race lead to Zoetemelk.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=119}} He took back 36 seconds on the time trial in [[Brussels]] on stage 11 before regaining the race lead after another time trial, uphill to [[Avoriaz]] on stage 15. At this stage, he led Zoetemelk by 1:48 minutes, with third-placed Kuiper already more than 12 minutes behind. Hinault gained another minute on stage 16, before Zoetemelk regained 47 seconds up Alpe d'Huez three days later. The final time trial of the Tour went Hinault's way once again, extending his advantage by a further 69 seconds. He also took the next stage in a slightly uphill sprint finish.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=119\u2013122}} On the final stage towards the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in [[Paris]], traditionally [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage in the Tour de France|a ceremonious affair without attacks]], Zoetemelk and Hinault broke away, with both gapping the field and Hinault taking another stage victory. Zoetemelk finished 3:07 minutes behind Hinault, but then had ten minutes added to his time for failing a doping test. The next finisher, [[Joaquim Agostinho]], was almost half an hour behind the winner.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=114\u2013116}}\n\nTowards the end of the season, Hinault won his second cycling monument, the [[1979 Giro di Lombardia|Giro di Lombardia]]. He had escaped from the field {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, but was later joined by some other riders. Only [[Silvano Contini]] finished with him, with the next group more than three minutes behind. The victory also secured that Hinault won his first of four consecutive [[Super Prestige Pernod International]] competitions, the award handed to the best rider of the season.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=123\u2013124}}\n\n====1980: Attempt at the Triple Crown====\nAs was often the case, Hinault started the season slowly in 1980, withdrawing from [[1980 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=129}} He then entered [[1980 Paris\u2013Roubaix|Paris\u2013Roubaix]], partly to prepare for the cobbled sections in the upcoming Tour de France, and finished fourth.{{sfn|Moore|2014|p=25}} A week later, he scored one of his most memorable wins at [[1980 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]]. As soon as the riders left [[Li\u00e8ge]], snow began to fall, soon turning into a blizzard. Hinault wanted to abandon, as had many others, including all but one of his teammates. He was convinced to carry on until the feeding station at [[Bastogne]], where the snow had turned into rain. Only 21 riders were left by this point. Hinault removed his rain cape and attacked, catching up to the leaders and carried on by himself, winning with a margin of almost ten minutes ahead of Kuiper. The victory came at a price, as his right index and middle fingers took weeks to recover from [[frostbite]], and caused him pain for several years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge's cold memories |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/liege-bastogne-lieges-cold-memories/ |website=[[Cyclingnews.com]] |accessdate=16 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816165809/http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/liege-bastogne-lieges-cold-memories/ |archivedate=16 August 2018 |date=23 April 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHinault and Guimard then turned their attention to the only Grand Tour he had not won yet: the [[Giro d'Italia]]. They hoped that Hinault would be able to reproduce a feat Eddy Merckx had achieved in 1974, winning the Giro, the Tour and the World Championship in the same year.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=131}} This is commonly referred to as the [[Triple Crown of Cycling]].{{efn|Since Merckx, only [[Stephen Roche]] managed to repeat the Triple Crown, in 1987.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Cossins |first1=Peter |title=Crowning achievement: How Stephen Roche completed his shock Triple Crown |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/crowning-achievement-stephen-roche-completed-shock-triple-crown-352929 |magazine=[[Cycling Weekly]] |accessdate=16 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816170637/https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/crowning-achievement-stephen-roche-completed-shock-triple-crown-352929 |archivedate=16 August 2018 |date=30 September 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nHinault started the [[1980 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]] as odds-on favourite, pitted against local riders Francesco Moser and Giuseppe Saronni, who had the home crowd on their side. Following a fourth place at the prologue in [[Genoa]], Hinault made a spontaneous visit to [[Fausto Coppi]]'s home of [[Castellania, Piedmont|Castellania]], paying respect to the first rider ever to have won Giro and Tour in the same year. On stage 5, a time trial to [[Pisa]], Hinault took over the race leader's [[pink jersey]]. He then relinquished his lead to [[Roberto Visentini]], who was not considered to be a contender for the final victory. On stage 14, he attacked when the peloton relaxed after an intermediate sprint, winning the stage ahead of [[Wladimiro Panizza]], who took the race lead. Hinault then made the decisive move of the race on stage 20, when he attacked on the tough climb of the [[Stelvio Pass]]. He caught up with his teammate Bernaudeau, and both carried on for the remaining {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the stage together. Hinault gifted the stage victory to his teammate, while he clinched the overall victory almost six minutes ahead of Panizza.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=131\u2013134}}\n\nIn the [[1980 Tour de France|Tour de France]], Hinault was once again set to duel with Joop Zoetemelk, who had moved to the dominant {{ct|TIR|1980}} squad. Hinault won the prologue in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, five seconds ahead of [[Gerrie Knetemann]].{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=134}} On stage{{nbsp}}5 from Li\u00e8ge to [[Lille]], which contained cobbled sections used in [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]], conditions were poor with rain and heavy winds. Hinault called for the field to take a slow tempo, but when Zoetemelk's teammate [[Jan Raas]] attacked, he went after him. He eventually found himself in a group with several other riders, while Zoetemelk was distanced. At {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish, he followed another attack from Kuiper and won the sprint at the line. The next stage was set to contain more cobbled roads, but on Hinault's protest, most of the worst parts were taken out. Hinault had however suffered damage to his left knee on the stage to Lille.{{sfn|Moore|2014|pages=27\u201331}} Hinault finished only fifth on stage 11's individual time trial, won by Zoetemelk.

The team decided to stick with their ''directeur sportif'', leading Hinault to search for a new team. He joined forces with businessman [[Bernard Tapie]] to form the new {{ct|LVC|1984}} squad. Their ''directeur sportif'' became Swiss coach {{interlanguage link|Paul K\u00f6chli|fr}}, who had made a name for himself with innovative and effective training methods, leaving Hinault a lot of freedom while at the same time scientifically measuring his progress.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=220\u2013226}} As part of his connection with Tapie, Hinault also contributed to the development of the [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless pedal]], created by Look, another company owned by Tapie.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Smythe |first1=Simon |title=Icons of cycling: Look's revolutionary clipless pedals |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/product-news/look-clipless-pedals-165379 |magazine=[[Cycling Weekly]] |accessdate=9 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109140213/https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/product-news/look-clipless-pedals-165379 |archivedate=9 January 2019 |date=7 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wilcockson |first1=John |title=Inside Cycling with John Wilcockson: LeMond, Hinault and the Tapie connection |url=https://www.velonews.com/2005/11/news/inside-cycling-with-john-wilcockson-lemond-hinault-and-the-tapie-connection_9177 |website=[[VeloNews]] |publisher=Pocket Outdoor Media, LLC. |accessdate=9 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109140218/https://www.velonews.com/2005/11/news/inside-cycling-with-john-wilcockson-lemond-hinault-and-the-tapie-connection_9177 |archivedate=9 January 2019 |date=18 November 2005}}</ref>\n\nHinault returned to racing at the [[Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana]], where he won the final stage. He then took victory at the [[Four Days of Dunkirk]]. But his spring campaign lacked major successes. At the [[1984 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]], he came second to [[Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez (cyclist)|Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez]], who later claimed that Hinault and his team had tried to intimidate him during the final stage of the race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=230\u2013231}} A memorable episode occurred during the [[1984 Paris\u2013Nice|Paris\u2013Nice]], a race he finished third overall. During stage{{nbsp}}5 to [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]], Hinault was descending in a lead group with several other favourites. As they reached the valley, the road was blocked by protesters, unhappy with the announced closure of a dockyard at [[La Ciotat]]. While the other riders stopped, he drove into the group head-on, dismounted, and punched the protester closest to him. In the ensuing fist fight, Hinault suffered a broken rib.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=199\u2013201}}\n\nThe [[1984 Tour de France|Tour de France]] was made out to be the big duel between Hinault and Fignon, who had just won the French National Championship.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=230\u2013231}}{{sfn|Moore|2014|p=133}} Hinault won the prologue, but Renault took the team time trial, 55 seconds ahead of La Vie Claire. He lost another 49 seconds to Fignon in the first long individual time trial, a discipline he had previously dominated. Following the second time trial, Hinault was only seventh on general classification, two minutes behind his adversary. The next stage led to Alpe d'Huez. Hinault attacked on the [[Rampe de Laffrey]], but Fignon was able to respond. The two exchanged attacks on the way up the climb, but it was in the valley that Hinault was able to draw out a gap of about a minute. On Alpe d'Huez itself, he was first passed by eventual stage winner [[Luis Herrera (cyclist)|Luis Herrera]]. When he started to slow, Fignon caught up to him and eventually dropped Hinault, who lost a further three minutes. He ultimately finished the Tour in second place, a significant ten minutes behind Fignon.{{sfn|Moore|2014|pages=133\u2013140}}\n\nHinaut managed to bounce back from his Tour defeat in the fall. In late September, he took his fifth and final victory at the Grand Prix des Nations, riding the {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} time trial at a then record speed of {{convert|44.19|kph|mph|abbr=on}}. Fignon could only manage fourth, more than two minutes behind. Next, he won the [[Trofeo Baracchi]], a two-man time trial, in which he competed with Moser. He then won the [[1984 Giro di Lombardia|Giro di Lombardia]] for a second time, breaking away from the group of favourites {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the finish.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=251\u2013253}}\n\n====1985: The second Giro-Tour double====\nFor 1985, Greg LeMond switched teams from Renault to join Hinault at La Vie Claire.{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=138}} Together, they entered the [[1985 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]]. During the race, Hinault was met with hostility from the home crowd, who supported local rider Francesco Moser. On the stage 12 time trial, Hinault took the pink jersey and opened the decisive gap to Moser, who would eventually finish second. During the stage however, Hinault was spat at by spectators and almost knocked over, even though his team car rode behind him with the door opened the entire time to ensure that bystanders would have a harder time impeding him. Hinault won his third Giro with a margin of just over a minute.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=254\u2013255}}\n\nIn the [[1985 Tour de France|Tour de France]], Fignon did not take part due to an Achilles heel injury. Hinault therefore entered the race as the favourite. He took victory in the prologue in his native [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]. La Vie Claire won the stage{{nbsp}}3 team time trial by over a minute. The next day, Hinault's teammate [[Kim Andersen (cyclist)|Kim Andersen]] took over the yellow jersey. Hinault supported him over the next days, even going so far as dropping back when Andersen punctured to lead him back into the peloton, showing his loyalty to riders who would later have to assist him. On stage 8, a time trial to [[Strasbourg]], Hinault took back the race lead, winning the stage by more than two minutes ahead of [[Stephen Roche]]. While the race travelled through the Alps and in a second time trial, he consolidated his lead, building an advantage of five-and-a-half minutes on LeMond, who was now second overall.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=150\u2013160}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it.

On stage 17, he showed signs of weakness and was unable to stay with the other leaders on the [[Col du Tourmalet]]. LeMond meanwhile followed an attack by Roche, but was forbidden by the team to cooperate to distance Hinault. LeMond would later claim that the team had deceived him by telling him that Hinault was closer behind than he actually was. Hinault eventually finished the stage just over a minute behind LeMond. The time LeMond waited may have been enough so that the two teammates would have contested the [[Maillot Jaune]] in the penultimate time trial. In the penultimate day's time trial, LeMond won the stage, but only five seconds ahead of Hinault, not enough to surpass him. This secured Hinault a record-equalling fifth Tour victory, by just under two minutes over his younger teammate. After the finish, he publicly pledged that he would support LeMond's bid for a first Tour victory the following year.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=150\u2013160}}\n\n====1986: The final season====\n[[File:Hautes-Alpes Col De L'Izoard Tour De France Hinault 071986 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Hinault climbing the [[Col d'Izoard]] during the [[1986 Tour de France]].

The pair gained more than four-and-a-half minutes on LeMond, with Delgado taking the stage win. Hinault was now in the lead of the general classification, 5:25 minutes ahead of LeMond.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=209\u2013211}} Even though his lead was significant, he attacked again the following day, on the descent of the Col du Tourmalet, the first climb of the day. By the top of the next climb, the [[Col d'Aspin]], he led the rest of the field by two minutes. However, joint effort behind brought him back before the final ascent up to the ski station of [[Superbagn\u00e8res]]. Hinault then cracked, coming in ninth, 4:39 minutes behind stage winner LeMond. He now led his teammate by only forty seconds in the general classification.<ref name=tenstages/>\n\nThe race then moved over to the Alps.

Hinault attacked repeatedly, but reached the bottom of Alpe d'Huez with LeMond. He led the way up the climb, lined by approximately 300,000 spectators and crossed the finish line hand in hand with LeMond, in an apparent display of comradery. [[Urs Zimmermann]], who had been second overall at the start of the day, lost more than five minutes.<ref name=alpedhuez/> Any signs of appeasement between the rivalling teammates was shattered by Hinault in a television interview shortly after the stage finish, when he declared that the race was not yet over, even though he trailed LeMond by 2:45 minutes.{{sfn|Moore|2011|pages=255\u2013258}}\n\nStage 20 saw the final time trial and the last chance for Hinault to overcome LeMond's advantage.

His biographer [[William Fotheringham]] has described him as \"the last of the sport's ''patrons''\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=11}} In this role, Hinault would use his influence with race organisers, control the pace of the peloton, and allow or refuse other riders the chance to attack. The riders' strike at Valence d'Agen in the 1978 Tour is cited as the first instance in which Hinault assumed this role.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=11\u201312}} His fellow riders stated that he, even though he did not talk much, was able to exert a high amount of certainty and therefore strength, which brought him respect and sometimes fear from his competitors.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=159}} To signal his authority, Hinault often symbolically rode at the front of the field, instead of in the slipstream of his teammates.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=205\u2013206}} His riding style has been described as \"fighting, full of aggression\", and he stated that when he did not feel good in a race, his reaction would be to attack.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|p=111}} Hinault described his own role as follows:\n{{quote|You are like a soldier, a general who dominates, who imposes his will on the others.

He would often greet his training partners in a night gown when they arrived on time for training or have an easy day of training that included stops at a bakery for cake. His distaste for training became even more evident in the winter, when he would gain a lot of weight. Laurent Fignon described the first training camps of the year as follows: \"He looked as if he had been inflated. If you didn't know the Badger you would wonder how long it would take for him to get back to what he had been. You would be making a huge mistake.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=169}} Hinault was capable of suffering through the training camp and returning to winning form within a month.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=168\u2013170}} Unlike a rider like Eddy Merckx, Hinault would not aim to win every race he entered. Millar described his approach as such: \"Hinault either cared or he didn't. When he didn't care about winning he'd bumble round and hurt you now and again just to remind you he was there.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=17\u201318}}\n\nWith a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of victories that includes all three Grand Tours (all of them more than once), the World Road Championships and a number of classics, Hinault has often been cited among the greatest cyclists of all time.<ref name=\"cn_greatest\"/><ref name=\"greatest\">{{cite magazine |title=Who is the greatest Grand Tour rider ever? |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/who-is-the-greatest-grand-tour-rider-ever-175929 |magazine=[[Cycling Weekly]] |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=14 October 2014}}</ref> The ''Historical Dictionary of Cycling'' describes him as \"one of the best riders ever\".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Heijmans |editor1-first=Jeroen |editor2-last=Mallon |editor2-first=Bill |title=Historical Dictionary of Cycling |date=2011 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |location=Plymouth |isbn=978-0-8108-7175-5 |pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> Comparisons are often drawn with Eddy Merckx, against whom Hinault rode at the beginning of his career. Lucien Van Impe commented: \"Merckx was the greatest, but Bernard [Hinault] was the most impressive.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=17}} A study conducted in 2006, ranking Tour de France riders from 1953 to 2004 by different performance indicators, put Hinault as the top Tour rider of that period, ahead of Merckx and [[Lance Armstrong]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cherchye |first1=Laurens |last2=Vermeulen |first2=Frederic |title=Robust Rankings of Multidimensional Performances |journal=[[Journal of Sports Economics]] |date=2006 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=359\u2013373 |doi=10.1177/2F1527002505275092|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1527002505275092?ck=nck|access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nHinault was nicknamed ''le [[wikt:blaireau#French|blaireau]]'' in French, a term that can be translated into English as either \"the shaving brush\" or \"the badger\". According to Fotheringham, the nickname originates from Hinault's early training partners, [[Maurice Le Guilloux]] and [[Georges Talbourdet]], who would use the term to tease the young rider. Le Guilloux used it once in front of Pierre Chany, a writer for ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'', and the name stuck.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|pages=154\u2013155}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=21}} According to Hinault himself, the term in the first place was supposed to mean no more than \"mate\" or \"buddy\".{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=14}} However, Hinault later embraced the association with the wild animal. In 2003, he commented: \"A badger is a beautiful thing. When it's hunted it goes into its sett and waits. When it comes out again, it attacks. That's the reason for my nickname. When I'm annoyed I go home, you don't see me for a month. When I come out again, I win.\"{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=156}} Hinault, as early as 1983, owned a stuffed badger to demonstrate his association with the animal.<ref name=tourdeforce/>\n\n=== Stance on doping ===\nHinault never tested positive for [[performance-enhancing drugs]] during his professional career and was never implicated in any doping practices.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dopingf\u00e4lle bei der Frankreich-Rundfahrt \u2013 Die Tour-T\u00e4ter |trans-title=Doping cases at the Tour de France - The Tour perpetrators|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/dopingfaelle-bei-der-tour-de-france-die-tour-taeter-1.117049-13 |newspaper=[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]] |accessdate=10 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110224345/https://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/dopingfaelle-bei-der-tour-de-france-die-tour-taeter-1.117049-13 |archivedate=10 January 2019 |language=German |date=6 February 2012}}</ref> He did, however, lead a riders' protest during a criterium race in [[Callac]] in 1982 against the sudden introduction of doping controls. He was handed a one-month suspended ban and fined [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 1,110, though the penalty was never enforced.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=205}}\n\nHinault has been outspoken about several prominent doping cases in the past years. In 2013, he heavily criticised [[Senate (France)|French senators]] for revealing the results of tests conducted in 2004 on samples from the [[1998 Tour de France]]. He called the initiative \"bullshit\" and urged lawmakers \"to stop bringing out the dead\", claiming they \"want to kill the Tour\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Hinault fears for Tour de France in light of doping drama |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/hinault-fears-for-tour-de-france-in-light-of-doping-drama/ |website=[[Cyclingnews.com]] |accessdate=11 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111105143/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/hinault-fears-for-tour-de-france-in-light-of-doping-drama/ |archivedate=11 January 2019 |date=27 June 2013}}</ref> In the same year, he reacted to comments made by [[Lance Armstrong]], a rider stripped of seven Tour victories due to doping offences. Armstrong suggested that it would be impossible to win the Tour de France without performance-enhancing substances. To counter this claim, Hinault replied: \"He must not know what it was like to ride without doping.\" Armstrong later clarified that he had spoken about the time when he was riding (1999\u20132005).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pretot |first1=Julien |title=Winning without doping was impossible: Armstrong |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-doping-armstrong-idUSBRE95R0QZ20130628 |accessdate=11 January 2019 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=28 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111110438/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-doping-armstrong-idUSBRE95R0QZ20130628 |archivedate=11 January 2019 |location=Porto Vecchio}}</ref> In early 2018, Hinault also spoke out about the adverse analytical result for [[salbutamol]] of four-time Tour winner [[Chris Froome]] at the [[2017 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]. He criticised Froome for taking part in the [[2018 Giro d'Italia]] while the investigation was still ongoing. In addition, he commented that Froome could not be \"listed among the cycling greats\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kelner |first1=Martha |title=Chris Froome should not be listed with cycling greats, says Hinault |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/chris-froome-cycling-bernard-hinault-giro-ditalia |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=11 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111110911/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/chris-froome-cycling-bernard-hinault-giro-ditalia |archivedate=11 January 2019 |date=30 May 2018}}</ref> Froome would win the Giro and become the first rider since Hinault to hold all three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]] Jerseys at once.
