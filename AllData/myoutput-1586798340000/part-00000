In his later career Brown starred in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), as Osgood Fielding III, in which he utters the film's famous punchline \"Well, nobody's perfect.\"\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born on July 28, 1891, in [[Holgate, Ohio]], near Toledo, into a large family largely of Welsh descent. He spent most of his childhood in Toledo. In 1902, at the age of ten, he joined a troupe of circus tumblers known as the Five Marvelous Ashtons, who toured the country on both the circus and [[vaudeville]] circuits. Later he became a professional baseball player. Despite his skill, he declined an opportunity to sign with the New York Yankees to pursue his career as an entertainer. After three seasons he returned to the circus, then went into vaudeville and finally starred on Broadway. He gradually added comedy to his act, and transformed himself into a comedian. He moved to Broadway in the 1920s, first appearing in the musical comedy ''Jim Jam Jems''.\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Earthworm Tractors (1936) 1.jpg|thumb|left|with [[June Travis]] in ''[[Earthworm Tractors]]'' (1936)]]\nIn late 1928, Brown began making films, starting the next year with [[Warner Brothers]]. He quickly became a favorite with child audiences,<ref name=NYT1/> and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]'' (1929). He starred in a number of lavish [[Technicolor]] musical comedies, including ''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929), ''[[Hold Everything (1930 film)|Hold Everything]]'' (1930), ''[[Song of the West]]'' (1930), and ''[[Going Wild]]'' (1930). By 1931, Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared.\n\nHe appeared in ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1932 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], and in ''[[Elmer, the Great]]'' (1933) with [[Patricia Ellis]] and [[Claire Dodd]] and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935) with [[Olivia de Havilland]], in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nIn 1933 he starred in ''[[Son of a Sailor]]'' with [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]] and [[Thelma Todd]]. In 1934, Brown starred in ''[[A Very Honorable Guy]]'' with [[Alice White]] and [[Robert Barrat]], in ''[[The Circus Clown]]'' again with Patricia Ellis and with [[Dorothy Burgess]], and with Maxine Doyle in ''Six-Day Bike Rider''.\n\nBrown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played [[Francis Flute]] in the [[Max Reinhardt]]/[[William Dieterle]] film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935) and was highly praised for his performance.<ref name=NYT1/> He starred in ''[[Polo Joe]]'' (1936) with [[Carol Hughes (actress)|Carol Hughes]] and [[Richard \"Skeets\" Gallagher]], and in ''[[Sons o' Guns]]''. In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top 10 earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic ''[[Film Fun]]'' for 20 years from 1933.\n\nHe left Warner Brothers to work for producer [[David L. Loew]], starring in ''[[When's Your Birthday?]]'' (1937). In 1938, he starred in ''[[The Gladiator (1938 film)|The Gladiator]]'', a loose adaptation of [[Philip Gordon Wylie]]'s 1930 novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'' that influenced the creation of ''[[Superman]]''.<ref>Jones, Gerard.

Publications International Ltd., 2000 ({{ISBN|0-7853-2963-3}}), p. 162</ref>\n\nAt age 50 when the U.S. entered World War II, Brown was too old to enlist. Both of his biological sons served in the military during the war. In 1942, Captain Don E. Brown, was killed when his [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] crashed near Palm Springs, California.<ref name=cdt>{{cite news |title=Capt.

He was the first to tour in this way and before [[Bob Hope]] made similar journeys. Brown also spent many nights working and meeting servicemen at the [[Hollywood Canteen]].<ref name=NYT1/> He wrote of his experiences entertaining the troops in his book ''Your Kids and Mine''. <!-- Commented out due under WP:OR and WP:RS <blockquote>While big USO names like Bob Hope did not visit the Leyte, Philippine area my father was in (housing was not good), Leyte received any number of entertainers during the war. Dad said the entertainers were all just a bunch of nice people. One group in particular was the top actors from a very popular and large musical of the times. Dad and a few of his buddies would walk back to the tents that housed the USO performers and would visit with them. Mostly, the USO performers were curious about the events on the islands and how the men were handling things. One performer, a \"wonderful comedian\" named Joe E. Brown, would commandeer a military vehicle and be driven around the island. The entertainer would stop military pedestrians, \"ream\" them for some inconsequential matter, start laughing, then invite them into the cab so they could be driven to their destinations. Joe E. Brown was greatly appreciated. (Memories of Capt. Donald Courtright, told to his daughter Mary in 2011){{citation needed|date=November 2014}}</blockquote> --> On his return to the U.S., Brown brought sacks of letters, making sure they were delivered by the Post Office. He gave shows in all weather conditions, many in hospitals, sometimes doing his entire show for a single dying soldier. He signed autographs for everyone. For his services to morale, Brown became one of only two civilians to be awarded the [[Bronze Star]] during World War II.\n\n==Postwar work==\nHis concern for the troops continued into the Korean War, as evidenced by a newsreel featuring his appeal for blood donations to aid the U.S. and UN troops there that was featured in the season 4 episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' titled \"Deluge\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638293/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title = \"M*A*S*H\" Deluge (TV Episode 1976)}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, he was awarded a Special [[Tony Award]] for his work in the touring company of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]''.<ref name=NYT1/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1948|title=1948 Tony Award Winners (BroadwayWorld.com)|work=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe had a cameo appearance in ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956), as the [[Fort Kearney]] stationmaster talking to Fogg ([[David Niven]]) and his entourage in a small town in Nebraska. In the similarly epic film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), he had a cameo as a union official giving a speech at a construction site in the climactic scene. On television, he was the mystery guest on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' during the episode on January 11, 1953.\n\nHis best known postwar role was that of aging millionaire Osgood Fielding III in [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1959 comedy ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Fielding falls for Daphne (Jerry), played by [[Jack Lemmon]] in drag; at the end of the film, Lemmon takes off his wig and reveals to Brown that he is a man, to which Brown responds \"Well, nobody's perfect\", one of the more celebrated punchlines in film.\n\nAnother of his notable postwar roles was that of Cap'n Andy Hawks in [[MGM]]'s 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'', a role that he reprised onstage in the 1961 [[New York City Center]] revival of the musical and on tour. Brown performed several dance routines in the film, and famed choreographer [[Gower Champion]] appeared along with first wife [[Marge Champion|Marge]]. Brown's final film appearance was in ''[[The Comedy of Terrors]]'' (1964).\n\n[[File:Buster Keaton Joe E Brown Route 66 1962.JPG|thumb|180px|Brown with [[Buster Keaton]] in the \"Journey to Ninevah\" episode of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' from 1962]]\n\nBrown was a sports enthusiast, both in film and personally. Some of his best films were the \"baseball trilogy\" which consisted of ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1932 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1932), ''[[Elmer, the Great]]'' (1933) and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935). He was a television and radio broadcaster for the New York Yankees in 1953. His son [[Joe L. Brown]] became the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the Pittsburgh Pirates for more than 20 years. Brown spent [[Ty Cobb]]'s last days with him, discussing his life.\n\nBrown's sports enthusiasm also led to him becoming the first president of [[PONY Baseball and Softball]] (at the time named Pony League) when the organization was incorporated in 1953. He continued in the post until late 1964, when he retired. Later he traveled additional thousands of miles telling the story of PONY League, hoping to interest adults in organizing baseball programs for young people. He was a fan of Thoroughbred horse racing, a regular at the racetracks in Del Mar and Santa Anita.\n\n==In popular culture==\nHe was caricatured in the [[Disney]] cartoons ''[[Mickey's Gala Premiere]]'' (1933), ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]'' (1938), and ''[[The Autograph Hound]]'' (1939); all contain a scene in which he is seen laughing so loud that his mouth opens extremely wide. According to the official biography ''Daws Butler: Characters Actor'', [[Daws Butler]] used Joe E. Brown as inspiration for the voices of two [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon characters: [[Lippy the Lion]] (1962) and [[Peter Potamus]] (1963{{ndash}}1966).<ref>{{Cite book|asin=1593930151|title=Daws Butler, Characters Actor: Ben Ohmart, Joe Bevilacqua: 9781593930158: Amazon.com: Books}}</ref>\n\n==Later life and family==\nBrown married Kathryn Francis McGraw in 1915. The marriage lasted until his death in 1973. The couple had four children: two sons, Don Evan Brown (December 25, 1916 {{ndash}} October 8, 1942; Captain in the United States Army Air Force, who was killed in the crash of an [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20B Havoc]] bomber while serving as a ferry pilot)<ref>Associated Press, \"Flying Son Of Film Star Crash Victim\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Friday 9 October 1942, Volume 49, page 1.</ref> and [[Joe L.

Both daughters were adopted as infants.\n\nJoe L. Brown shared his father's love of baseball, serving as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1976, and briefly in 1985, also building the 1960 and 1971 [[World Series]] champions. Brown's '71 Pirates featured baseball's first all-black starting nine.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Son of a Sailor lobby card.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lobby card for ''[[Son of a Sailor]]'' (1933) ]]\nBrown began having heart problems in 1968 after suffering a severe heart attack, and underwent cardiac surgery.

After three seasons he returned to the circus, then went into vaudeville and finally starred on Broadway. He gradually added comedy to his act, and transformed himself into a comedian. He moved to Broadway in the 1920s, first appearing in the musical comedy ''Jim Jam Jems''.\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Earthworm Tractors (1936) 1.jpg|thumb|left|with [[June Travis]] in ''[[Earthworm Tractors]]'' (1936)]]\nIn late 1928, Brown began making films, starting the next year with [[Warner Brothers]]. He quickly became a favorite with child audiences,<ref name=NYT1/> and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]'' (1929). He starred in a number of lavish [[Technicolor]] musical comedies, including ''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929), ''[[Hold Everything (1930 film)|Hold Everything]]'' (1930), ''[[Song of the West]]'' (1930), and ''[[Going Wild]]'' (1930). By 1931, Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared.\n\nHe appeared in ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1932 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], and in ''[[Elmer, the Great]]'' (1933) with [[Patricia Ellis]] and [[Claire Dodd]] and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935) with [[Olivia de Havilland]], in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nIn 1933 he starred in ''[[Son of a Sailor]]'' with [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]] and [[Thelma Todd]]. In 1934, Brown starred in ''[[A Very Honorable Guy]]'' with [[Alice White]] and [[Robert Barrat]], in ''[[The Circus Clown]]'' again with Patricia Ellis and with [[Dorothy Burgess]], and with Maxine Doyle in ''Six-Day Bike Rider''.\n\nBrown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played [[Francis Flute]] in the [[Max Reinhardt]]/[[William Dieterle]] film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935) and was highly praised for his performance.<ref name=NYT1/> He starred in ''[[Polo Joe]]'' (1936) with [[Carol Hughes (actress)|Carol Hughes]] and [[Richard \"Skeets\" Gallagher]], and in ''[[Sons o' Guns]]''. In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top 10 earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic ''[[Film Fun]]'' for 20 years from 1933.\n\nHe left Warner Brothers to work for producer [[David L. Loew]], starring in ''[[When's Your Birthday?]]'' (1937). In 1938, he starred in ''[[The Gladiator (1938 film)|The Gladiator]]'', a loose adaptation of [[Philip Gordon Wylie]]'s 1930 novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'' that influenced the creation of ''[[Superman]]''.<ref>Jones, Gerard.

Publications International Ltd., 2000 ({{ISBN|0-7853-2963-3}}), p. 162</ref>\n\nAt age 50 when the U.S. entered World War II, Brown was too old to enlist. Both of his biological sons served in the military during the war. In 1942, Captain Don E. Brown, was killed when his [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] crashed near Palm Springs, California.<ref name=cdt>{{cite news |title=Capt.

He was the first to tour in this way and before [[Bob Hope]] made similar journeys. Brown also spent many nights working and meeting servicemen at the [[Hollywood Canteen]].<ref name=NYT1/> He wrote of his experiences entertaining the troops in his book ''Your Kids and Mine''. <!-- Commented out due under WP:OR and WP:RS <blockquote>While big USO names like Bob Hope did not visit the Leyte, Philippine area my father was in (housing was not good), Leyte received any number of entertainers during the war. Dad said the entertainers were all just a bunch of nice people. One group in particular was the top actors from a very popular and large musical of the times. Dad and a few of his buddies would walk back to the tents that housed the USO performers and would visit with them. Mostly, the USO performers were curious about the events on the islands and how the men were handling things. One performer, a \"wonderful comedian\" named Joe E. Brown, would commandeer a military vehicle and be driven around the island. The entertainer would stop military pedestrians, \"ream\" them for some inconsequential matter, start laughing, then invite them into the cab so they could be driven to their destinations. Joe E. Brown was greatly appreciated. (Memories of Capt. Donald Courtright, told to his daughter Mary in 2011){{citation needed|date=November 2014}}</blockquote> --> On his return to the U.S., Brown brought sacks of letters, making sure they were delivered by the Post Office. He gave shows in all weather conditions, many in hospitals, sometimes doing his entire show for a single dying soldier. He signed autographs for everyone. For his services to morale, Brown became one of only two civilians to be awarded the [[Bronze Star]] during World War II.\n\n==Postwar work==\nHis concern for the troops continued into the Korean War, as evidenced by a newsreel featuring his appeal for blood donations to aid the U.S. and UN troops there that was featured in the season 4 episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' titled \"Deluge\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638293/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title = \"M*A*S*H\" Deluge (TV Episode 1976)}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, he was awarded a Special [[Tony Award]] for his work in the touring company of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]''.<ref name=NYT1/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1948|title=1948 Tony Award Winners (BroadwayWorld.com)|work=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe had a cameo appearance in ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956), as the [[Fort Kearney]] stationmaster talking to Fogg ([[David Niven]]) and his entourage in a small town in Nebraska. In the similarly epic film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), he had a cameo as a union official giving a speech at a construction site in the climactic scene. On television, he was the mystery guest on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' during the episode on January 11, 1953.\n\nHis best known postwar role was that of aging millionaire Osgood Fielding III in [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1959 comedy ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Fielding falls for Daphne (Jerry), played by [[Jack Lemmon]] in drag; at the end of the film, Lemmon takes off his wig and reveals to Brown that he is a man, to which Brown responds \"Well, nobody's perfect\", one of the more celebrated punchlines in film.\n\nAnother of his notable postwar roles was that of Cap'n Andy Hawks in [[MGM]]'s 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'', a role that he reprised onstage in the 1961 [[New York City Center]] revival of the musical and on tour. Brown performed several dance routines in the film, and famed choreographer [[Gower Champion]] appeared along with first wife [[Marge Champion|Marge]]. Brown's final film appearance was in ''[[The Comedy of Terrors]]'' (1964).\n\n[[File:Buster Keaton Joe E Brown Route 66 1962.JPG|thumb|180px|Brown with [[Buster Keaton]] in the \"Journey to Ninevah\" episode of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' from 1962]]\n\nBrown was a sports enthusiast, both in film and personally. Some of his best films were the \"baseball trilogy\" which consisted of ''[[Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1932), ''[[Elmer, the Great]]'' (1933) and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935). He was a television and radio broadcaster for the New York Yankees in 1953. His son [[Joe L. Brown]] became the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the Pittsburgh Pirates for more than 20 years. Brown spent [[Ty Cobb]]'s last days with him, discussing his life.\n\nBrown's sports enthusiasm also led to him becoming the first president of [[PONY Baseball and Softball]] (at the time named Pony League) when the organization was incorporated in 1953. He continued in the post until late 1964, when he retired. Later he traveled additional thousands of miles telling the story of PONY League, hoping to interest adults in organizing baseball programs for young people. He was a fan of Thoroughbred horse racing, a regular at the racetracks in Del Mar and Santa Anita.\n\n==In popular culture==\nHe was caricatured in the [[Disney]] cartoons ''[[Mickey's Gala Premiere]]'' (1933), ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]'' (1938), and ''[[The Autograph Hound]]'' (1939); all contain a scene in which he is seen laughing so loud that his mouth opens extremely wide. According to the official biography ''Daws Butler: Characters Actor'', [[Daws Butler]] used Joe E. Brown as inspiration for the voices of two [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon characters: [[Lippy the Lion]] (1962) and [[Peter Potamus]] (1963{{ndash}}1966).<ref>{{Cite book|asin=1593930151|title=Daws Butler, Characters Actor: Ben Ohmart, Joe Bevilacqua: 9781593930158: Amazon.com: Books}}</ref>\n\n==Later life and family==\nBrown married Kathryn Francis McGraw in 1915. The marriage lasted until his death in 1973. The couple had four children: two sons, Don Evan Brown (December 25, 1916 {{ndash}} October 8, 1942; Captain in the United States Army Air Force, who was killed in the crash of an [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20B Havoc]] bomber while serving as a ferry pilot)<ref>Associated Press, \"Flying Son Of Film Star Crash Victim\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Friday 9 October 1942, Volume 49, page 1.</ref> and [[Joe L.

Both daughters were adopted as infants.\n\nJoe L. Brown shared his father's love of baseball, serving as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1976, and briefly in 1985, also building the 1960 and 1971 [[World Series]] champions. Brown's '71 Pirates featured baseball's first all-black starting nine.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Son of a Sailor lobby card.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lobby card for ''[[Son of a Sailor]]'' (1933) ]]\nBrown began having heart problems in 1968 after suffering a severe heart attack, and underwent cardiac surgery.
