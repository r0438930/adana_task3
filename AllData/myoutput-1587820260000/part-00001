When a wiretap reveals that the couple intended, first, to have the employer held criminally responsible for the baby's murder and, second, to sue the employer for wrongful death. Initially, the primary issue appears to be the fetus age at which a murder charge can be leveled. The primary issue proves to be two-fold; 1. whether the suspects can be held accountable for knowing both the law and its meaning, and 2. even if the suspects cannot legally be convicted of the baby's murder, whether they can be convicted of a lesser crime, i.e. attempted murder.\n |LineColor=fa9d6e\n}}{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|Law & Order (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber=29\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=In Memory Of\n |DirectedBy=Ed Sherin\n |WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay\n | s = Siobhan Byrne;\n | t = Robert Stuart Nathan;\n | ex1 = David Black\n | slabel = {{abbr|S|Story by}}\n | tlabel = {{abbr|T|Teleplay by}}\n | ex1label = {{abbr|S/T|Story and teleplay by}}\n }}\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1991|11|5}}\n |ProdCode=67413\n |Aux4=18.10{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n |ShortSummary=The renovation of a brownstone uncovers the remains of a young boy who disappeared thirty-one years earlier during the 1960 presidential campaign.

Time span confirmation of the baby's conception and the employer-secretary affair eliminates the employer as a suspect. Suspicion shifts to the secretary and her boyfriend Christopher Baylor (a disbarred lawyer) David Alcott. When a wiretap reveals that the couple intended, first, to have the employer held criminally responsible for the baby's murder and, second, to sue the employer for wrongful death. Initially, the primary issue appears to be the fetus age at which a murder charge can be leveled. The primary issue proves to be two-fold; 1. whether the suspects can be held accountable for knowing both the law and its meaning, and 2. even if the suspects cannot legally be convicted of the baby's murder, whether they can be convicted of a lesser crime, i.e. attempted murder.\n |LineColor=fa9d6e\n}}{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|Law & Order (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber=29\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=In Memory Of\n |DirectedBy=Ed Sherin\n |WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay\n | s = Siobhan Byrne;\n | t = Robert Stuart Nathan;\n | ex1 = David Black\n | slabel = {{abbr|S|Story by}}\n | tlabel = {{abbr|T|Teleplay by}}\n | ex1label = {{abbr|S/T|Story and teleplay by}}\n }}\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1991|11|5}}\n |ProdCode=67413\n |Aux4=18.10{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n |ShortSummary=The renovation of a brownstone uncovers the remains of a young boy who disappeared thirty-one years earlier during the 1960 presidential campaign.
