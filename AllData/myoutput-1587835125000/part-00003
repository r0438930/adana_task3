Living in [[Bohusl\u00e4n|Bohus]], Sweden,  the family started playing golf at nearby Lyseg\u00e5rden Golf Club, but soon switched to Gullbringa Golf & Country Club, the same club as six years younger [[Helen Alfredsson]] started her career. Ehrnlund found more interest in horse riding at young ages, but allergy against horses forced her to golf instead. At 15 years of age, she moved to Palm Springs, California, to practice for [[Johnny Revolta]] and stayed for two years.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Amateur career==\nStill at junior age, she dominated Swedish amateur golf, winning the Swedish Match-play Championship in 1977 and 1978, as well as the open amateur championships of Sweden, Germany and Austria in 1978. At the end of  the 1978 season and her amateur career, she represented Sweden, together with [[Liv Wollin]] and Charlotte Mongomery, in the [[Espirito Santo Trophy]] in Pacific Harbour, [[Fiji|Fidji]], were the Swedish team finished 8th.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Professional career==\nIn 1979, she turned professional on the nascent Women's Professional Golf Association (WPGA) Tour, later renamed [[Ladies European Tour]]. In August 1980 Ehrnlund played the Welsh Classic at [[Whitchurch Golf Club]] in [[Cardiff]], Wales. She was in the lead after two rounds with 68\u201374, and after the last round was cancelled due to rain she was declared the winner.
