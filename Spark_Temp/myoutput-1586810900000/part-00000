Its terrain is mixture of swamp and prairie.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site]]]]\n[[File:StMartinChurchWM.JPG|thumb|right|[[St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church (St. Martinville, Louisiana)|St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church]]]]\nIn the 16th century, the area between the [[Atchafalaya River]], in Louisiana, the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], in [[Texas]], was occupied by numerous tribes or subdivisions of the [[Attakapan]] people. The territory was not closed to outsiders, and several traders roamed through it on business.\n\nEuropeans did not begin to settle there until French explorers claimed and founded the colony of Louisiana in 1699. They referred to the territory between the Atchafalaya River and [[Bayou Nezpique]], where the Eastern Atakapa lived, as the Attakapas Territory, adopting the name from the Choctaw language term for this people. The French colonial government gave land away to French soldiers and settlers.\n\n''Poste des Atakapas'' (Attakapas Post) was founded as a trading post on the banks of the Bayou Teche, and settlers started to arrive. Some came separately from [[France]], such as M. Masse, who came about 1754 from [[Grenoble]]. Gabriel [[Fuselier de la Claire]], a Frenchman from [[Lyon]], and some other Frenchmen from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], in present-day Alabama, arrived in late 1763 or early 1764.  Fuselier bought land between [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] and [[Bayou Teche]] from the Eastern Attakapas chief [[Kinemo]]. Shortly after that, the rival Appalousa ([[Opelousas]]) invaded the area via the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]] and [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]] rivers, and exterminated much of the Eastern Atakapan.  Gabriel Fuselier's son Agricole Fuselier was prominent in settling what developed as [[New Iberia, Louisiana]].\n\nGradually groups of more French speakers arrived, such as the first [[Acadians]] from [[Nova Scotia]]. They were assigned to this area in 1765 by [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]], the French official who was administering Louisiana for the Spanish. They had been [[Expulsion of Acadians|expelled from Acadia]] by the British, who had defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]] and taken over its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Spain took over Louisiana and other territories west of the Mississippi but tended to rely on French colonists to administer ''[[La Louisiane]]''.\n\nThe Acadians were led by [[Joseph Broussard]]. In 1768-1769 fifteen families arrived from [[Pointe Coupee]], another French colonial community. Their members had migrated from [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Ha\u00efti]]) or from [[Paris]] via [[Fort de Chartres]], in present-day Illinois. Between the arrivals of the two groups, the French captain \u00c9tienne de Vaugine came in 1764 and acquired a large domain east of Bayou Teche.\n\nOn April 25, 1766, after the arrival of the first Acadians, the census showed a population of 409 inhabitants for the Attakapas region. In 1767 the Attakapas Post had 150 inhabitants before the arrival of the 15 families from Pointe Coupee.\n\nIn 1803, after losing his effort to regain control over Saint-Domingue during its slave revolt, [[Napoleon]] sold Louisiana in 1803 to the United States through the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  The US settlers and territorial government organized the Attakapas Territory between 1807 and 1868. After Louisiana became a state, [[Saint Martin Parish]] was created. Attakapas Post was renamed as [[Saint Martinville]] and designated as the parish seat.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 652\n|1870= 1190\n|1880= 1606\n|1890= 1814\n|1900= 1926\n|1910= 2318\n|1920= 2465\n|1930= 2455\n|1940= 3501\n|1950= 4614\n|1960= 6468\n|1970= 7153\n|1980= 7965\n|1990= 7137\n|2000= 6989\n|2010= 6114\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=5903\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2017-05-03|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2010, there were 6,114 people, 2,320 households, and 1,533 families residing in the city.

Its terrain is mixture of swamp and prairie.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site]]]]\n[[File:StMartinChurchWM.JPG|thumb|right|[[St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church (St. Martinville, Louisiana)|St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church]]]]\nIn the 16th century, the area between the [[Atchafalaya River]], in Louisiana, the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], in [[Texas]], was occupied by numerous tribes or subdivisions of the [[Attakapan]] people. The territory was not closed to outsiders, and several traders roamed through it on business.\n\nEuropeans did not begin to settle there until French explorers claimed and founded the colony of Louisiana in 1699. They referred to the territory between the Atchafalaya River and [[Bayou Nezpique]], where the Eastern Atakapa lived, as the Attakapas Territory, adopting the name from the Choctaw language term for this people. The French colonial government gave land away to French soldiers and settlers.\n\n''Poste des Atakapas'' (Attakapas Post) was founded as a trading post on the banks of the Bayou Teche, and settlers started to arrive. Some came separately from [[France]], such as M. Masse, who came about 1754 from [[Grenoble]]. Gabriel [[Fuselier de la Claire]], a Frenchman from [[Lyon]], and some other Frenchmen from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], in present-day Alabama, arrived in late 1763 or early 1764.  Fuselier bought land between [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] and [[Bayou Teche]] from the Eastern Attakapas chief [[Kinemo]]. Shortly after that, the rival Appalousa ([[Opelousas]]) invaded the area via the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]] and [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]] rivers, and exterminated much of the Eastern Atakapan.  Gabriel Fuselier's son Agricole Fuselier was prominent in settling what developed as [[New Iberia, Louisiana]].\n\nGradually groups of more French speakers arrived, such as the first [[Acadians]] from [[Nova Scotia]]. They were assigned to this area in 1765 by [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]], the French official who was administering Louisiana for the Spanish. They had been [[Expulsion of Acadians|expelled from Acadia]] by the British, who had defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]] and taken over its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Spain took over Louisiana and other territories west of the Mississippi but tended to rely on French colonists to administer ''[[La Louisiane]]''.\n\nThe Acadians were led by [[Joseph Broussard]]. In 1768-1769 fifteen families arrived from [[Pointe Coupee]], another French colonial community. Their members had migrated from [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Ha\u00efti]]) or from [[Paris]] via [[Fort de Chartres]], in present-day Illinois. Between the arrivals of the two groups, the French captain \u00c9tienne de Vaugine came in 1764 and acquired a large domain east of Bayou Teche.\n\nOn April 25, 1766, after the arrival of the first Acadians, the census showed a population of 409 inhabitants for the Attakapas region. In 1767 the Attakapas Post had 150 inhabitants before the arrival of the 15 families from Pointe Coupee.\n\nIn 1803, after losing his effort to regain control over Saint-Domingue during its slave revolt, [[Napoleon]] sold Louisiana in 1803 to the United States through the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  The US settlers and territorial government organized the Attakapas Territory between 1807 and 1868. After Louisiana became a state, [[Saint Martin Parish]] was created. Attakapas Post was renamed as [[Saint Martinville]] and designated as the parish seat.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 652\n|1870= 1190\n|1880= 1606\n|1890= 1814\n|1900= 1926\n|1910= 2318\n|1920= 2465\n|1930= 2455\n|1940= 3501\n|1950= 4614\n|1960= 6468\n|1970= 7153\n|1980= 7965\n|1990= 7137\n|2000= 6989\n|2010= 6114\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=5903\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2017-05-03|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2010, there were 6,114 people, 2,320 households, and 1,533 families residing in the city.
