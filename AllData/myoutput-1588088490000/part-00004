The female grows up to 18&nbsp;mm, with a 30&nbsp;mm legspan. As with most spiders, the males are smaller (10&nbsp;mm), and have longer legs in relation to their body size. In both sexes the carapace and legs are dark brown to black, and the abdomen is charcoal grey with a dorsal pattern of light markings (sometimes indistinct) and a dense covering of fine, velvety hair. ''B. longinqua'' is slightly smaller (14&nbsp;mm) with a greyish carapace and red-brown legs.\n\n==Habits, mating and reproduction==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n[[Image:Black house spider02.jpg|thumb|250px|Black house spider in its web]]\nThe web of ''B. insignis'' is a messy-looking construct of irregular sail-like shapes. There is a funnel-shaped, silken retreat, usually in the middle or corner of the web, where the spider spends most of its time waiting for prey.  The female spider never leaves the web unless forced to. They seem quite attached to their location, rarely changing the position of their webs and because of this, old webs can be quite messy, often with small objects or dust stuck in them. At night the spider comes out to repair and add to the web, often just adding new silk over the old. Males, when ready to mate, go in search of females. The male plucks the web of the female to attract her attention. Once the male has made sure that the female will be receptive, he will approach and inseminate her with his palps. They may then stay together for several days, and may mate again several times.\n\nThe female constructs several white silk egg sacs, which are secured within the web retreat. The female stays with the eggs until they hatch. The spiderlings then disperse. Occasionally the young spiders stay in the web of the mother for some time, catching the smaller prey that the larger spider would ignore.\n\nPredators include the [[white-tailed spider]], as well as parasitic wasps and flies.\n\n==Bite==\n\nBlack house spiders are [[venom]]ous, but are not considered dangerous. They are timid and bites from them are infrequent. The bite may be excruciatingly painful and cause local swelling. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sweating and giddiness are occasionally recorded. In a few cases, skin lesions (arachnogenic [[necrosis]]) have developed after multiple bites.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/mites-spiders/common-neighbourhood-spiders?page=0%2C1 |title=Common neighbourhood spiders |publisher=Government of Western Australia}}</r its ok to have 1 or 2 as a pet.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}\n''B.&nbsp;insignis'' is native to [[Australia]], but has been introduced to [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]].<ref name=WSC_s8693/> It is widely distributed throughout Australia and New Zealand.
