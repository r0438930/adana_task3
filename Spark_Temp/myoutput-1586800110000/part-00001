Since the beginning of the 21st century, Hamilton County has been the second most populous county in Central Indiana.\n\nHamilton County's roots are in agriculture. However, after [[World War II]], Indianapolis grew north and towns in the southern part of the county developed as [[suburbs]]. Residential and commercial development have replaced many farm fields. The northern part of the county remains largely agricultural. Today, the county is one of the fastest-growing counties in the [[United States]]. According to 2007 estimates by the U.S. Census, the county's population increased from an estimated 182,740 in 2000 to 261,661 in 2007, making it the fastest-growing county in Indiana out of 92. Recently{{when|date=June 2018}}, Hamilton County surpassed [[St. Joseph County, Indiana|St. Joseph County]] in population, making it the state's fourth most populous.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hamilton takes top spot in county headcount |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008803210423 |work=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2008-03-21 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> It is also the third densest in the state, after Marion and Lake Counties.\n\nIn 2010, Hamilton County was home to three of the state's 20 largest cities and towns: [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]] (8th), [[Fishers, Indiana|Fishers]] (9th), and [[Noblesville]] (14th).\n\n[[Geist Reservoir|Geist]] and Morse reservoirs are two man-made lakes in Hamilton County that offer recreational opportunities such as boating, fishing, and waterfront living.\n\nIn June 2008, Hamilton County was named America's Best Place to Raise a Family by Forbes.com<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/06/27/schools-places-family-forbeslife-cx_zg_0630realestate_slide_21.html?thisSpeed=30000 | work=Forbes | title=In Depth: America's Best Places To Raise A Family - Forbes.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191448/http://www.forbes.com/2008/06/27/schools-places-family-forbeslife-cx_zg_0630realestate_slide_21.html?thisSpeed=30000|archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref> due to its strong economy, affordable living, top-ranked schools, and close proximity to Indianapolis.

[[William Conner]] was the first white settler in the county. In the summer of 1822, after realizing there were enough settlers in the area, Conner and other settlers applied to the Indiana Legislature for a charter authorizing them to become a separate and independent county under Indiana law. The application was presented to the Legislature at the 1822-23 session and the act was passed and approved by the governor on January 8, 1823. The act took effect on the first Monday in April (April 7), 1823. The County Commissioners first met on May 5, 1823, at the house of [[William Conner]]. Conner's house would also serve as the County Circuit Court. The county was named after [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first secretary of the treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Hamilton County stats| publisher=Indiana.edu| url=http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| accessdate=2007-06-30| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708012823/http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| archivedate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

The Board of County Commissioners consists of three Commissioners representing their three respective [[districts]].\n\nDistrict 1 consists of [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], which is coextensive with Clay Township.

Dillinger - District 2\n* Mark Heirbrandt - District 3\n\nThe county's finances are managed by the [[County Council]], which consists of seven members, four elected by [[district]] and three elected [[at-large]].\n\nDistrict 1 consists of parts of Clay Township (45 precincts). District 2 consists of Delaware, Fall Creek, and Wayne Townships. District 3 consists of Noblesville, Jackson and White River Townships.

In 1912, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]] had carried the county with a 3.06% plurality over Republican opponent [[William Taft]].<ref name=\"uselectionatlas.org\">[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential Atlas (Maps for Indiana by election)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130204636/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 |date=2008-11-30 }} Results prior to 1960 available through subscription only</ref>\n\nHamilton County's loyalty to the Republican Party is not limited to presidential elections. The county regularly rejects Democrats in [[Governor of Indiana|gubernatorial]] and [[United States Senate|senatorial]] races, and is typically one of the Republicans' strongest counties at the state level. One of the few times in recent memory that Hamilton County has supported a Democrat for governor or Senate was in 1992, when [[Evan Bayh]] narrowly carried it with 50.48 percent of the vote in his successful reelection bid.  However, Bayh lost Hamilton County in his three bids for Senate.\n\nDespite these facts, however, the county is slowly tilting more Democratic like many suburban counties. [[Donald Trump]] in 2016 gave the weakest showing for a Republican nominee  since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932, despite his statewide dominance that year, winning just 56% of the vote. Thus, Hamilton County voted less Republican than the rest of the state for the first time in almost 100 years, even though Trump still carried the county. Eight years earlier, [[Barack Obama]] received 38.45% of the county vote during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], the strongest result for a Democrat since [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1936. [[Joe Donnelly]] in his 2018 senate re-election loss also came less than 10% away from winning the county, winning 44.4% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Election Results 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/indiana/ |website=Politico}}</ref>\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

[[William Conner]] was the first white settler in the county. In the summer of 1822, after realizing there were enough settlers in the area, Conner and other settlers applied to the Indiana Legislature for a charter authorizing them to become a separate and independent county under Indiana law. The application was presented to the Legislature at the 1822-23 session and the act was passed and approved by the governor on January 8, 1823. The act took effect on the first Monday in April (April 7), 1823. The County Commissioners first met on May 5, 1823, at the house of [[William Conner]]. Conner's house would also serve as the County Circuit Court. The county was named after [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first secretary of the treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Hamilton County stats| publisher=Indiana.edu| url=http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| accessdate=2007-06-30| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708012823/http://www.stats.indiana.edu/profiles/pr18057.html| archivedate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

The Board of County Commissioners consists of three Commissioners representing their three respective [[districts]].\n\nDistrict 1 consists of [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], which is coextensive with Clay Township.  District 2 consists of [[Fishers, Indiana|Fishers]],  [[Noblesville, Indiana|Noblesville]], Delaware Township, and Noblesville Township.  District 3 consists of Adams Township, Fall Creek Township, Jackson Township, Washington Township, Wayne Township, White River Township, [[Arcadia, Indiana|Arcadia]], [[Atlanta, Indiana|Atlanta]], [[Cicero, Indiana|Cicero]], [[Sheridan, Indiana|Sheridan]] and [[Westfield, Indiana|Westfield]].\n\nThe current County Commissioners are:\n\n* Christine Altman - District 1\n* Steven C. Dillinger - District 2\n* Mark Heirbrandt - District 3\n\nThe county's finances are managed by the [[County Council]], which consists of seven members, four elected by [[district]] and three elected [[at-large]].\n\nDistrict 1 consists of parts of Clay Township (45 precincts). District 2 consists of Delaware, Fall Creek, and Wayne Townships. District 3 consists of Noblesville, Jackson and White River Townships. District 4 consists of parts of Clay Township (17 precincts), Adams and Washington Townships.\n\nThe current members of the County Council are:\n\n* Fred Glynn - District 1\n* Amy Massillamany - District 2\n* Steve Schwartz<sup>1</sup> - District 3\n* Paul Ayers - District 4\n* Brad Beaver - Council member at large\n* Jim Belden - Council member at large\n* Rick McKinney - Council member at large\n\nHamilton County is part of [[Indiana's 5th congressional district]]; [[Indiana Senate]] districts 20, 21, 28, 29 and 30;<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/3006.htm\n |title       = Indiana Senate Districts\n |publisher   = State of Indiana\n |accessdate  = 2011-07-14\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110115070750/http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/3006.htm\n |archivedate = 2011-01-15\n}}</ref> and [[Indiana House of Representatives]] districts 29, 32, 35, 36, 38, 39, 86, 87 and 88.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/3005.htm\n |title       = Indiana House Districts\n |publisher   = State of Indiana\n |accessdate  = 2011-07-14\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110115070752/http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/3005.htm\n |archivedate = 2011-01-15\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nThe county is located in [[Indiana's 5th congressional district]], which is represented by [[Susan Brooks]].\n\nHamilton County has been won by every [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate since [[Charles Evans Hughes]] in 1916. In 1912, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Woodrow Wilson]] had carried the county with a 3.06% plurality over Republican opponent [[William Taft]].<ref name=\"uselectionatlas.org\">[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential Atlas (Maps for Indiana by election)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130204636/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 |date=2008-11-30 }} Results prior to 1960 available through subscription only</ref>\n\nHamilton County's loyalty to the Republican Party is not limited to presidential elections. The county regularly rejects Democrats in [[Governor of Indiana|gubernatorial]] and [[United States Senate|senatorial]] races, and is typically one of the Republicans' strongest counties at the state level. One of the few times in recent memory that Hamilton County has supported a Democrat for governor or Senate was in 1992, when [[Evan Bayh]] narrowly carried it with 50.48 percent of the vote in his successful reelection bid.  However, Bayh lost Hamilton County in his three bids for Senate.\n\nDespite these facts, however, the county is slowly tilting more Democratic like many suburban counties. [[Donald Trump]] in 2016 gave the weakest showing for a Republican nominee  since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932, despite his statewide dominance that year, winning just 56% of the vote. Thus, Hamilton County voted less Republican than the rest of the state for the first time in almost 100 years, even though Trump still carried the county. Eight years earlier, [[Barack Obama]] received 38.45% of the county vote during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], the strongest result for a Democrat since [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1936. [[Joe Donnelly]] in his 2018 senate re-election loss also came less than 10% away from winning the county, winning 44.4% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Election Results 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/indiana/ |website=Politico}}</ref>\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
