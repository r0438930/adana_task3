The conference was organised by the [[Friends World Committee for Consultation]] (FWCC).\n\n==Controversies==\nRetired President Moi lost a part of his Kabarak University in a landmark court ruling. Moi was ordered to surrender {{convert|100|acre|ha|0}} to a neighbouring rancher, Malcolm Bell. He was ordered by the Court of Appeal to surrender the farm within six months.

The university and Moi High School Kabarak, which was developed during Moi's 24 years in power, were some of his pet projects. If he did not comply with the orders, he could face eviction. Judgment was delivered in Nakuru by Justice Martha Koome and Justice Hannah Okwengu. Justice Muga Apondi had allowed the school to continue occupying the land, saying that it had acquired a title deed by [[adverse possession]]. (According to that system, if people occupy a piece of land for more than 12 years without the owner's permission, then they become the owner.)\n\nBell sued the retired president in 2003, arguing he could not have done it earlier because he enjoyed immunity. Later, the Board of Governors of Kabarak asked to be enjoined in the case, arguing that the institution had adverse possession of the land. Justice Apondi agreed and threw out Bell's case in 2006. In August 2012, the judges said there was nothing like Board of Governors at Moi High School Kabarak since it was a private institution. Only public schools are managed by boards. \u201cWe cannot have a Board of Governors in a private school and Mr Moi denied ownership of the school yet evidence in court shows that he is part and parcel of it,\u201d said Judge Koome who read the judgement. She said the school principal, Dr Henry Kiplagat, who swore an affidavit on behalf of the school, refused to disclose its owner.<ref name=\"nmg1\"/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.kabarak.ac.ke Kabarak University website]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Kenyan universities}}\n\n[[Category:Private universities and colleges in Kenya]]\n[[Category:Education in Rift Valley Province]]\n[[Category:Nakuru]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2002]]\n[[Category:2002 establishments in Kenya]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{primary sources|date=December 2008}}\n{{update |date=December 2018}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox university\n |name              = Kabarak University\n |native_name       = \n |image        =Kabarak_University_logo.jpeg\n\n |image_name        = \n |image_size        = \n |caption           = \n |latin_name        = \n |motto             = Education in Biblical Perspective\n |mottoeng          = \n |established       = September 2002\n |closed            = \n |type              = [[Private university]]\n |affiliation       = African Inland Church\n |endowment         = \n |rector            = \n |officer_in_charge = \n |chairman          = \n |chancellor        = Retired President Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi\n |vice-president    = \n |superintendent    = \n |provost           = Rev.
