Powell states that fringe political organizations, such [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|The Minutemen]] and [[Weather Underground|The Weathermen]], are not the intended audience, rather it is written for \"the silent majority\". Powell envisioned the United State people rebelling against what he deemed to be oppressive capitalistic ideals, and to a lesser extent, against fascist and communist movements.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Content ===\nPowell begins the content of his book discussing anarchy and anarchist theory. Anarchy, by his definition, is a wide scale mass uprising by the people, similar to that of civil disobedience through violence.<ref name=\":3\" /> He believed that anarchy was the innate state of all individuals, and therefore human nature would drive people to participate in such practices. Powell believed that current expressions of politics, arts, music, and education all contained innate principles of anarchist ideals, thereby equating anarchism to individualism. This principle drives Powell's argumentation as he believed that the current political climate and Vietnam war had undermined human values, therefore revolution based upon his perception of human dignity and freedom was what drove him to write the piece. He ends his introduction by warning of the seriousness that these recipes may have deadly consequences if used improperly.<ref name=\":3\" /> The chapters of ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' include descriptions and detailed instructions in hand-to-hand combat, explosives, booby traps, drugs, tear gas, sabotage and demolition, surveillance, improvised weapons and other topics related to anarchism.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Legal reviews ===\nAt the time of its publication, one [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] memo described ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' as \"one of the crudest, low-brow, paranoiac writing efforts ever attempted\".<ref>[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (2011-02-16) [http://reason.com/blog/2011/02/16/the-fbi-on-the-anarchist-cookb The FBI on ''The Anarchist Cookbook''], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''</ref> The book was reviewed by the Department of Justice, the White House, the FBI, and by both [[John Dean]] and [[Mark Felt]], [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] lawyer and [[J.

He described that the book was not intended for extant political fringe organizations, rather it was designed to galvanize a great societal change by inciting the general population. The ultimate goal of the text was to provide the general population with the skills and capabilities to organize against fascist, capitalist, and communist threats that he perceived.

At the time of writing, Powell believed that the United States was slowly declining towards communism, thus he found it necessary to pen a book that guided people on revolution against this transition.

Powell states that fringe political organizations, such [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|The Minutemen]] and [[Weather Underground|The Weathermen]], are not the intended audience, rather it is written for \"the silent majority\". Powell envisioned the United State people rebelling against what he deemed to be oppressive capitalistic ideals, and to a lesser extent, against fascist and communist movements.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Content ===\nPowell begins the content of his book discussing anarchy and anarchist theory. Anarchy, by his definition, is a wide scale mass uprising by the people, similar to that of civil disobedience through violence.<ref name=\":3\" /> He believed that anarchy was the innate state of all individuals, and therefore human nature would drive people to participate in such practices. Powell believed that current expressions of politics, arts, music, and education all contained innate principles of anarchist ideals, thereby equating anarchism to individualism. This principle drives Powell's argumentation as he believed that the current political climate and Vietnam war had undermined human values, therefore revolution based upon his perception of human dignity and freedom was what drove him to write the piece. He ends his introduction by warning of the seriousness that these recipes may have deadly consequences if used improperly.<ref name=\":3\" /> The chapters of ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' include descriptions and detailed instructions in hand-to-hand combat, explosives, booby traps, drugs, tear gas, sabotage and demolition, surveillance, improvised weapons and other topics related to anarchism.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Legal reviews ===\nAt the time of its publication, one [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] memo described ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' as \"one of the crudest, low-brow, paranoiac writing efforts ever attempted\".<ref>[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (2011-02-16) [http://reason.com/blog/2011/02/16/the-fbi-on-the-anarchist-cookb The FBI on ''The Anarchist Cookbook''], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''</ref> The book was reviewed by the Department of Justice, the White House, the FBI, and by both [[John Dean]] and [[Mark Felt]], [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] lawyer and [[J.
