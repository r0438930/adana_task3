Born in Lisbon, Portugal, he has been designing sailing and motor [[yachts]] since about 1980, with more than 8,000 boats launched, ranging from custom boats and [[one-design]] production models to [[superyacht]]s. His design firm is based in [[Hamble-le-Rice]], England.\n\n==Career==\nAs a [[Chartered Engineer]], his first job came about when it was discovered that Denis Doyle's yacht ''Moonduster'' was floating above her 'marks', having been built less heavily than had been intended her designer, [[Germ\u00e1n Frers]]. Castro advised that lead be attached to the underside of the coachroof and had a hole drilled in the keel to reduce her stability, which gave the vessel an exceptionally good handicap for a boat of her size. ''Moonduster'' held the Round Ireland monohull record from Wicklow to Wicklow for nearly 15 years until the record was broken by a Whitbread around the World yacht. Her fastest elapsed time for the race came in 1984, when she took only 88h, 15m and 43s to complete the course.\n\nAfter leaving [[Ron Holland]]\u2019s design team in 1980, Castro's first significant racing yacht design was ''Justine III'', for Frank Woods of the National Yacht Club in Ireland. She was the first and only yacht to win the [[One Ton Cup]] with five straight first place victories. The same owner then built ''Justine IV'', which was crowned best Offshore Admiral's Cupper in 1983.\n\nThen followed ''Iztanother Purla'', a 43 footer which missed being chosen for the British Admiral's Cup Team, but then went on to win all 7 races in Cowes Week, beating all the Admiral's Cuppers, helmed by the late Sir [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Peter Blake]] and his NZ crew from ''Steinlager''. A boat full of innovative ideas, including praddle steering, a method of steering using a vertical arm rising from below the cockpit floor.<ref>Seen at Wicklow Sailing Club before competing in Round Ireland Yacht Race as 'The Famous Grouse'.</ref>  {{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nLater successes included the two-time Quarter-Ton Cup winner ''McDonald's'', the [[Half Ton Cup]] winner ''Balthazar'', and the 6mR World Championship and Coupe de France winner ''Thisbe''.\n\nHe was appointed by a member of Royal Cork Yacht Club to redesign the J24, with the aim of producing an exciting sports boat. The client expected a bigger mainsail, a new deck moulding and an effective keel to give greater stability. The result was the 1720 sportsboat. A new era in Sportsboat racing had started: The boats were built in Co. Kerry, and about 100 were built starting with sail number 1720, and although successful, it was considered that the 1720 had shortcomings, namely too powerful a rig, which meant that the boat required too many crew. The [[SB20]], elected Boat of the Year Overall 2008, addressed all of these shortcomings and is now to be seen worldwide.\n\nCastro's designers work with many boatyards internationally, including the [[Royal Huisman]], [[Jongert]], [[Palmer Johnson]], [[Neptunus]], [[CS Yachts]], [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]], and [[Jeanneau]].\n\nMost recently during the global pandemic has gone into administration however he has said that he will push through this.\n\n==Achievements==\n\n===Major achievements===\nHis designs have won Yacht of the Year awards, a Superyacht Design award and several World championships.
