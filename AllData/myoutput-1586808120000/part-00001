{"title_page": "Regnecentralen", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Regnecentralen logo.svg|thumb|Logo of Regnecentralen]]\n'''Regnecentralen''' ('''RC''') was the first [[Denmark|Danish]] [[computer]] company, founded on October 12, 1955. Through the 1950s and 1960s, they designed a series of computers, originally for their own use, and later to be sold commercially. Descendants of these systems sold well into the 1980s. They also developed a series of high-speed [[paper tape]] machines, and produced [[Data General Nova]] machines under license.\n\n==Genesis==\n\nWhat would become RC began as an advisory board formed by the Danish ''Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber'' (''Academy of Applied Sciences'') to keep abreast of developments in modern electronic [[Computer|computing devices]] taking place in other countries. After several years in the advisory role, in 1952 they decided to form a computing [[service bureau]] for Danish government, military and research uses. Led by Niels Ivar Bech, the group was also given the details of the [[BESK]] machine being designed at the Swedish Mathematical Center (Matematikmaskinnamndens Arbetsgrupp).\n\nThe group decided to build their own version of the BESK to run the bureau, and formed Regnecentralen in October 1955 to complete and run the machine. The result was the [[DASK]], a [[vacuum tube]]-based machine that completed construction in 1956 and went into full operation in February 1957. DASK was followed in 1961 by the fully [[transistor]]ized GIER, used for similar tasks. GIER is an acronym for \"[[Geod\u00e6tisk Institut]]s Elektroniske Regnemaskine\" (Institute of Geodetics Electronic Calculator) and was introduced there on September 14, 1961. GIER proved to be a useful machine, and went on to be used at many Danish universities. Bech also sold GIER machines to the [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, starting with [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Bulgaria]], and later [[Romania]], the [[East Germany]], and [[Yugoslavia]].\n\nRC was also home to [[Peter Naur]], and DASK and GIER became well known for their role in the development of the famous programming language [[ALGOL]]. After the first European ALGOL conference in 1959, RC began an effort to produce a series of compilers, completing one for the DASK in September 1961. A version for the GIER followed in August 1962. Christian Andersen and Peter Schyum Poulsen, another RC employee, wrote the first introductory text on the language, ''Everyman's Desk ALGOL'', in 1961.\n\n==Peripheral business==\n\nTo support higher throughput at their own service bureau, RC developed several high-speed [[input/output]] devices. One of their most popular was the [[RC 2000]] [[paper tape]] reader, introduced in 1963. Feeding the tape at 5 meters per second, the 2000 could read 2,000 characters per second (CPS), storing the results in a buffer while the computer periodically read the data back out instead of stopping the tape to wait for the computer to get ready. The machine was later upgraded as the RC 2500, increasing speed to almost 7 meters a second, improving read speed to 2500 CPS. The RC 2000/2500 became a major product for RC during the 1960s, selling 1,500 examples around the world. Several related devices were added to the line, including a high-speed punch and a dedicated data conversion machine that would \"massage\" data between formats to ease the burden on the host computer.\n\nIn 1964 Regnecentralen was taken public. Most of the firm's shares were held by its biggest customers.\n\n==New computers==\n\nIn the mid-1960s, RC began the design of a small [[integrated circuit]]-based computer system for industrial control and [[automation]] needs, initially to fill a request by a Danish company to automate a chemical factory they were building in [[Poland]]. The [[RC 4000 multiprogramming system|RC 4000]] design emerged in 1966 and was completed for the factory the next year. When combined with appropriate [[peripheral]]s, almost always including an RC 2000 along with several rebranded devices from other companies, the RC 4000 was a highly reliable [[minicomputer]], and went on to be sold across Europe. The [[RC 8000]] from the mid-1970s used newer-generation [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) to shrink the RC 4000 into a single [[rack-mount]] system. The last in the series, the [[RC 9000]], further shrunk the machine and improved performance to about 4 [[Million instructions per second|MIPS]], and was sold in versions that could run either RC 8000 programs, or [[Unix]].\n\nThe RC 4000 is famous for its [[operating system]], developed by [[Per Brinch Hansen]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=RC 4000 Computer Software: Multiprogramming System |last=Brinch Hansen |first=Per |publisher=Regnecentralen |year=1969 |isbn= |location=|pages=|url=http://brinch-hansen.net/papers/1969c.pdf}}</ref> Known as the [[RC 4000 multiprogramming system]], it is the first real-world example of a system using a very simple kernel along with a variety of user-selected programs that built up the system as a whole.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://brinch-hansen.net/papers/1970a.pdf|title=The nucleus of a multiprogramming system|last=Brinch Hansen|first=Per|date=April 1970|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=13|issue=4|pages=238\u2013241|doi=10.1145/362258.362278|pmid=|access-date=|citeseerx=10.1.1.105.4204}}</ref> Today this concept is known as a [[microkernel]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Per Brinch Hansen \u2022 IEEE Computer Society|url=http://www.computer.org/web/awards/pioneer-per-hansen|website=www.computer.org|accessdate=2015-12-15}}</ref> and efforts to correct for microkernels' poor performance formed the basis of most OS research through the 1970s and 1980s.
