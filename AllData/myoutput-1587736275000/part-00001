In departure from prior Mustang models, the sixth generation Mustang includes fully [[Independent suspension|independent rear suspension]] on all models, as well as an optional 2.3L [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] and [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injected]] four cylinder engine. The new Mustang was introduced as a 2015 model year vehicle, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Ford Mustang, which was revealed as a 1965 model year vehicle on April 17, 1964.\n\nThe sixth generation is also the first [[Ford Mustang]] to be marketed and sold globally, and represented the first time that factory [[right hand drive]] Mustangs were produced in addition to the [[left hand drive]] models. This is part of the \"One Ford\" business plan, which also applies to the [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]], [[Ford Focus|Focus]], [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Fusion]]/[[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]], [[Ford Escape|Escape]]/[[Ford Kuga|Kuga]], [[Ford Edge|Edge]], [[Ford Transit Connect]], and [[Ford Transit]], as well as other models.\n\n==Background==\nThe sixth generation of the Ford Mustang debuted on December 5, 2013 with same-day media events in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], [[Los Angeles, California]], [[New York City, New York]], [[Barcelona, Spain]], [[Shanghai, China]], and [[Sydney, Australia]].<ref name=\"debut\">{{cite press release|title=Ford to reveal all-new Mustang Dec. 5; Teams with Facebook and Instagram for 15-day countdown|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2013/11/19/ford-to-reveal-all-new-mustang-dec--5--teams-with-facebook-and-i.html|publisher=media.ford.com|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref> The 2015 Mustang marks the 50th anniversary of continuous Mustang production, which began in March 1964 in advance of the debut of the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|original Mustang]] at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] on April 17, 1964 in [[Flushing, Queens]].\n\nDevelopment of the 2015 Mustang, codenamed \"S550\", began in 2009 under chief engineer Dave Pericak and (from late-2009) exterior design director Joel Piaskowski, shortly after the updated 2010 model year Mustang went on sale. In December 2010, an exterior design theme proposal by Kemal Curic from Ford's Cologne, Germany design studios was selected by design management. Curic (also responsible for the 2011 Focus (2012 in the US) and the 2014 Mondeo/Fusion) relocated to Ford's design studios in Dearborn in January 2011. During mid-stage development, Curic's original exterior design proposal was eventually rejected by Ford executives, resulting in rapid design changes. After reviewing 3 different exterior theme proposals (A, B, and C) in design clinics in September 2012, the final exterior design (Theme A) was approved by Ford management, with the final design freeze occurring in December 2012, 20 months ahead of originally scheduled August 2014 production. The interior design program began in the spring of 2010, under Doyle Letson. By late 2011, a final interior proposal was settled on and was a combination of Themes A & B. In June 2012, the final interior design was frozen. The first [[development mule|test mules]] in 2010 model year bodies were spotted earlier in June 2012, and the first S550 prototypes were built five months later (exterior design freeze) in May 2013.<ref name=\"Simona\">{{cite web|author=Simona |title=2015 Ford Mustang|url= http://www.topspeed.com/cars/ford/2015-ford-mustang-ar114432.html|publisher=topspeed.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"articles-latimes\">{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Jerry|title=Ford unveils sixth-generation Mustang for 50th anniversary|url= https://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/04/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-mustang-debut-20131204|publisher=articles.latimes.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"gizmag\">{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=C.C.|title=All-new Ford Mustang gets a fastback makeover, EcoBoost engine|url= http://www.gizmag.com/ford-sixth-generation-mustang/30037/ |publisher=gizmag.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"caradvice\">{{cite web|last=Zalstein|first=David|title=Ford Mustang sixth-gen muscle car detailed in new videos|url= http://www.caradvice.com.au/263272/ford-mustang-sixth-gen-muscle-car-detailed-in-new-videos/|publisher=caradvice.com.au|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2015-ford-mustang-in-depth-with-the-team-that-made-it-happen-feature|title=2015 Ford Mustang: In-Depth with the Team that Made It Happen|author=|date=|work=caranddriver.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kemal-curic/a/8b4/84a Kemal Curic Mustang/GT350 Design Manager Ford of America], ''linkedin.com''</ref>\n\n==Engines==\nAt launch, three engines were available: a standard aluminum 3.7 L [[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|\"Cyclone\"]] V6, an optional 2.3 L [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], [[Gasoline direct injection|direct-injected]] I4, or a 5.0 L [[Ford Modular engine#5.0 L Coyote|\"Coyote\"]] V8.<ref name=\"Specs\">{{cite press release|url= https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/asset.download.document.pdf.html/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2015_Specs/Mustang_Specs_USA.pdf |title=2015 Ford Mustang USA - technical specifications |publisher=Ford Media  |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 2.3 L EcoBoost engine is new to the Mustang, having debuted in the 2015 model year [[Lincoln MKC]] crossover.

The cylinders are now lined with a thinner coating achieved by [[Plasma transferred wire arc thermal spraying|plasma coating]], instead of the thicker and heavier traditional cylinder sleeves.\n\nThe Shelby GT350 version uses a modified version of the Coyote engine, code-named the [[Ford Modular engine#Voodoo|Voodoo]], that features a displacement of 5.2 liters with [[V8 engine#Flat-plane crankshaft|flat-plane]] crankshaft instead of the traditional crossplane, with a naturally aspirated induction.\n\nThe Shelby GT500 version is another variant of the Coyote, code-named the [[Ford Modular engine#Predator|Predator]], this time keeping the [[V8 engine#Cross-plane crankshaft|cross-plane crankshaft]] and adding a supercharger.

The model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\n* The sporty '''EcoBoost''' model offers the same features as the '''V6''' model, but replaces the carryover 3.7 L V6 engine with a new 2.3 L Turbocharged I4 engine and adds power front driver's and passenger's seats. This model is only available in Fastback style. \n* The midrange '''EcoBoost Premium''' model adds to the EcoBoost model [[leather]] seating surfaces, [[MyFord Touch]] with Ford SYNC, and [[HD Radio]], the SHAKER Premium Sound System,  and more. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\n* The performance-oriented '''GT''' model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. This model is only available in Fastback style.\n* The top-of-the-line '''GT Premium''' model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. It also adds nineteen-inch alloy wheels. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\nThe old [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby]] GT500 models are discontinued for 2015, along with the 5.8 L V8 [[supercharged]] engine.  They have since been supplanted by the GT350/350R models featuring the new 5.2 L flat plane crank V8.\n\nExport-spec variants currently consist of only the EcoBoost and GT grades, with the UK and Australia receiving both the Fastback and Convertible styles and various parts of Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan) receiving the Fastback only (as of June 2016).  Meanwhile, Performance Packages are standard on all Asia-bound EcoBoost and GT trims.

The new Mustang sports a mildly restyled front clip and dashboard design, and new standard and optional wheels. Inside, a new optional twelve-inch, fully digital LCD instrument cluster adorns the dash, and can be heavily customized by the driver.  However, none of these updates were applied to the Shelby GT350/GT350R, which retained their unique front end and speedometer/tachometer/instrument cluster.\n\nA new ten-speed automatic transmission replaces the existing six-speed unit, and joins the six-speed manual transmission as an option. The new ten-speed automatic transmission is a joint development between [[General Motors]] and the [[Ford Motor Company]], where it is already used in the 2017 [[Chevrolet Camaro (sixth generation)|Chevrolet Camaro ZL1]] and 2017 [[Ford F-150 SVT Raptor]]. The MagneRide adjustable suspension system, previously only available in the Shelby GT350 and the Shelby GT350R, is now available on standard Mustang models. An Active Valve Performance switchable exhaust system allows the driver to customize the Mustang's exhaust note. Also newly available is a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, which is now offered in addition to the available heated and ventilated leather-trimmed front bucket seats. The instrument panel has also been redesigned with new trim panels, available in four standard finishes, as well as [[carbon fiber]], depending upon the model of Mustang that is chosen.

In December 2010, an exterior design theme proposal by Kemal Curic from Ford's Cologne, Germany design studios was selected by design management. Curic (also responsible for the 2011 Focus (2012 in the US) and the 2014 Mondeo/Fusion) relocated to Ford's design studios in Dearborn in January 2011. During mid-stage development, Curic's original exterior design proposal was eventually rejected by Ford executives, resulting in rapid design changes. After reviewing 3 different exterior theme proposals (A, B, and C) in design clinics in September 2012, the final exterior design (Theme A) was approved by Ford management, with the final design freeze occurring in December 2012, 20 months ahead of originally scheduled August 2014 production. The interior design program began in the spring of 2010, under Doyle Letson. By late 2011, a final interior proposal was settled on and was a combination of Themes A & B. In June 2012, the final interior design was frozen. The first [[development mule|test mules]] in 2010 model year bodies were spotted earlier in June 2012, and the first S550 prototypes were built five months later (exterior design freeze) in May 2013.<ref name=\"Simona\">{{cite web|author=Simona |title=2015 Ford Mustang|url= http://www.topspeed.com/cars/ford/2015-ford-mustang-ar114432.html|publisher=topspeed.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"articles-latimes\">{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Jerry|title=Ford unveils sixth-generation Mustang for 50th anniversary|url= https://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/04/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-mustang-debut-20131204|publisher=articles.latimes.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"gizmag\">{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=C.C.|title=All-new Ford Mustang gets a fastback makeover, EcoBoost engine|url= http://www.gizmag.com/ford-sixth-generation-mustang/30037/ |publisher=gizmag.com|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"caradvice\">{{cite web|last=Zalstein|first=David|title=Ford Mustang sixth-gen muscle car detailed in new videos|url= http://www.caradvice.com.au/263272/ford-mustang-sixth-gen-muscle-car-detailed-in-new-videos/|publisher=caradvice.com.au|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2015-ford-mustang-in-depth-with-the-team-that-made-it-happen-feature|title=2015 Ford Mustang: In-Depth with the Team that Made It Happen|author=|date=|work=caranddriver.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kemal-curic/a/8b4/84a Kemal Curic Mustang/GT350 Design Manager Ford of America], ''linkedin.com''</ref>\n\n==Engines==\nAt launch, three engines were available: a standard aluminum 3.7 L [[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|\"Cyclone\"]] V6, an optional 2.3 L [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], [[Gasoline direct injection|direct-injected]] I4, or a 5.0 L [[Ford Modular engine#5.0 L Coyote|\"Coyote\"]] V8.<ref name=\"Specs\">{{cite press release|url= https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/asset.download.document.pdf.html/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2015_Specs/Mustang_Specs_USA.pdf |title=2015 Ford Mustang USA - technical specifications |publisher=Ford Media  |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 2.3 L EcoBoost engine is new to the Mustang, having debuted in the 2015 model year [[Lincoln MKC]] crossover.

The 2015 Ford Mustang is offered in several models:\n\n* The base '''V6''' model offers standard features such as the carryover 3.7 L V6 engine from the previous-generation Mustang, cloth front bucket seats, an AM/FM radio with six speakers, [[Ford SYNC]], [[USB]], [[iPod]], and auxiliary input jacks, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, keyless access with push-button start and either a six-speed [[manual transmission]] or [[automatic transmission]]. The model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\n* The sporty '''EcoBoost''' model offers the same features as the '''V6''' model, but replaces the carryover 3.7 L V6 engine with a new 2.3 L Turbocharged I4 engine and adds power front driver's and passenger's seats. This model is only available in Fastback style. \n* The midrange '''EcoBoost Premium''' model adds to the EcoBoost model [[leather]] seating surfaces, [[MyFord Touch]] with Ford SYNC, and [[HD Radio]], the SHAKER Premium Sound System,  and more. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\n* The performance-oriented '''GT''' model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. This model is only available in Fastback style.\n* The top-of-the-line '''GT Premium''' model replaces the 2.3 L I4 engine with the carryover 5.0 L V8 engine. It also adds nineteen-inch alloy wheels. This model is available in Fastback or Convertible styles.\nThe old [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby]] GT500 models are discontinued for 2015, along with the 5.8 L V8 [[supercharged]] engine.  They have since been supplanted by the GT350/350R models featuring the new 5.2 L flat plane crank V8.\n\nExport-spec variants currently consist of only the EcoBoost and GT grades, with the UK and Australia receiving both the Fastback and Convertible styles and various parts of Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan) receiving the Fastback only (as of June 2016).  Meanwhile, Performance Packages are standard on all Asia-bound EcoBoost and GT trims. Markets like India receive only the GT trim (mated to the automatic transmission).\n\nAn '''EcoBoost Performance Package''' was added for the 2020 model year, which raised the output of the turbocharged I4 engine to {{convert|330|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, using the engine from the Focus RS, and upgraded various parts.

The GT350 is more track focused than the GT500, and was benchmarked against the Camaro Z28, Porsche GT3, and BMW M4. Notable features are track-focused chassis tuning, significant aero-dynamic changes to include lowering the hood around the engine, 2-piece, cross-drilled brake rotors paired with [[Brembo]] calipers, [[MagneRide]] damping option, lightweight [[Tremec TR-3160 transmission|Tremec TR-3160]] six speed manual transmission, [[Recaro]] seats, and various lightweight components (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced polymer radiator support that directs cooling channels for various components).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sae.org/13709/|title=Flat-plane crankshaft spins 'Voodoo' into Ford\u2019s new Shelby V8|author=|date=|work=sae.org}}</ref>\n\nAdditional options, such as larger alloy wheels, [[navigation system]], rear backup sensors, a rear backup camera, blind spot monitoring, security system, SHAKER PRO [[Surround Sound]] Premium Sound System, premium leather seating surfaces, and [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] front [[headlamps]] are available.

Items removed include air conditioning, the stereo system, rear seats, trunk floorboard and carpet, backup camera and emergency tire sealer and inflator. Exhaust resonators also have been removed for weight savings with the benefit of creating a sharper exhaust tone.\n\nThe Shelby GT350R is more than 130&nbsp;lbs (59&nbsp;kg) lighter than the Shelby GT350 Track Pack model, which has proven its durability in multiple 24-hour racetrack tests. The GT350R also comes with carbon fiber wheels which weigh only 18&nbsp;lbs (8&nbsp;kg) each compared to similarly specified aluminum wheels which typically weigh 33&nbsp;lbs (15&nbsp;kg) each.\n\nAside from carbon fiber wheels, larger front splitter and rear wing, Shelby GT350R features distinct design details. Exterior touches include red painted brake calipers, red pin striping at the edges of the optional over-the-top racing stripes and Shelby GT350R badging. Inside is high-contrast red stitching, Shelby GT350R badging and the D-shaped steering wheel fitted with a red center mark at the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/01/12/shelby-gt350r-mustang.html|title=Shelby GT350R Mustang: Most Track-Capable Production Mustang Ever Built Coming to U.S., Canada Later This Year|author=|date=|work=ford.com}}</ref>\n\nOne optional feature for the GT350R is the GT350R Technology Package, which adds the Ford SYNC 3 multimedia infotainment system, seven speakers, a rear backup camera system, SIRIUS-XM Satellite Radio, and air conditioning. The package is ideal for GT350R buyers who plan to use their car for more than track purposes or for show.  Parts of this package, namely the infotainment system and backup camera, were made standard during April 2018 production, due to U.S. legislation requiring all new vehicles sold in the U.S. to have backup cameras.\n\n===Bullitt Mustang (2019)===\n[[File:Ford Mustang Bullit Genf 2018.jpg|thumb|2019 Mustang Bullitt|alt=]]\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', Ford unveiled the latest incarnation of the ''Bullitt'' edition Mustang GT at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] (NAIAS).

In addition, the car will have custom instrument panel graphics, dashboard stitching, seat pattern, and optional [[Recaro]] seats. The 5.0 L V8 receives a larger 87mm throttle body, modified GT350 manifold and cold air intake with re calibration, resulting in a power increase to {{convert|480|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

For 2018, Ford has dropped the previously base V6 model and its {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.7L Cyclone V6 engine, leaving the EcoBoost, the GT, the Shelby GT350 and the Shelby GT350R. The new Mustang sports a mildly restyled front clip and dashboard design, and new standard and optional wheels. Inside, a new optional twelve-inch, fully digital LCD instrument cluster adorns the dash, and can be heavily customized by the driver.  However, none of these updates were applied to the Shelby GT350/GT350R, which retained their unique front end and speedometer/tachometer/instrument cluster.\n\nA new ten-speed automatic transmission replaces the existing six-speed unit, and joins the six-speed manual transmission as an option. The new ten-speed automatic transmission is a joint development between [[General Motors]] and the [[Ford Motor Company]], where it is already used in the 2017 [[Chevrolet Camaro (sixth generation)|Chevrolet Camaro ZL1]] and 2017 [[Ford F-150 SVT Raptor]]. The MagneRide adjustable suspension system, previously only available in the Shelby GT350 and the Shelby GT350R, is now available on standard Mustang models. An Active Valve Performance switchable exhaust system allows the driver to customize the Mustang's exhaust note. Also newly available is a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, which is now offered in addition to the available heated and ventilated leather-trimmed front bucket seats. The instrument panel has also been redesigned with new trim panels, available in four standard finishes, as well as [[carbon fiber]], depending upon the model of Mustang that is chosen.  A new Performance Package 2 incorporates a larger radiator, wider Pilot Cup 2 tires and Brembo brake calipers (like on the GT350), enhanced springs, K-Brace, a Strut-Tower Brace, larger Sway Bar, and unique chassis tuning, and brings the Mustang GT much closer to the GT350 in handling and performance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cjponyparts.com/resources/2018-mustang-gt-performance-package-level-2 |title= 2018 MUSTANG GT PERFORMANCE PACKAGE VS PERFORMANCE PACKAGE LEVEL 2\n|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFeatures that remain available from the 2017 Ford Mustang include: the [[Ford Sync|SYNC 3]] infotainment system featuring [[Android Auto]] and [[Apple CarPlay]] compatibility, the SHAKER PRO premium audio system, the GT Performance Package, the Premium Plus Package, and the Wheel and Stripe Package. New exterior color options include: Orange Fury Metallic Tri-Coat and Royal Crimson Metallic Tinted Clear Coat, while new interior color options include Showstopper Red and Midnight Blue.
