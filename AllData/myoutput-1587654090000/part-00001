''bear-thing'' or ''bear-person''}} is the main antagonist of the series. He is a strange, remote-controlled [[teddy bear]] who proclaims himself to be the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy and initiates a life of mutual killing among the students. He has various copies of himself throughout the academy and will punish anyone that attempts to attack him or breaks the academy's rules.\n\nVisually, Monokuma is divided into two halves. Seen from the front his left half is a cute white teddy bear with black details and grey shading; his right half has black fur and adds red as a spot color applied to his eye\nto contribute to his sadistic appearance together with an evil smirk.\n\nThe identity of Monokuma's controller, as well as his motives for bringing the students together, are central to the mysteries that the students must investigate. It is revealed that Monokuma is actually a series of robots created by Monaca Towa for an army that Junko Enoshima used. In the first two games, Monokuma was used as a proxy for Junko in her trials; in ''Another Episode'', he is a series of different types of enemies; in ''Danganronpa 3'', he is under the control of Kazuo Tengan to force Ryota Mitarai into brainwashing the entire world for the sake of hope. He is the only returning character in ''Danganronpa V3'' as a part of the Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles, now controlled by Tsumugi Shirogane and accompanied by the Monokuma Kubs.\n\n==''Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc''==\n<!-- The NIS America release uses \"Ultimate\" in place of \"Super High School Level\".

An ordinary high school student who was accepted to the academy by raffle. He has no spectacular talents, aside from his belief that he is a bit more optimistic than most people, and was given the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}} due to winning the lottery. Ironically, he often falls prey to bad luck more often than not. It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}. He manages to escape from the academy alive and joins an organization called the Future Foundation, dedicated to rebuilding the world and fighting against Junko's legacy.\n\n:During the events of ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair|Danganronpa 2]]'', he and the other survivors attempt to rehabilitate some of the Remnants of Despair by placing them inside a virtual world which would rewrite their memories of being Ultimate Despair students. However, because of a virus containing Junko's Alter Ego, the world is turned into another killing game, prompting Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya to eventually enter the virtual world themselves to help the surviving students activate a shutdown sequence to stop Junko once and for all. Makoto also appears in ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls|Danganronpa Another Episode]]''. He returns as the protagonist of ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School|Danganronpa 3]]'', where he becomes involved in Monokuma's Monokuma Hunter game. His forbidden action is \"running in the hallway.\" After surviving the Monokuma Hunter game, Makoto becomes the headmaster of the rebuilt Hope's Peak Academy.<ref name=\"anotherepappearance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Has Danganronpa 1's Hero, Makoto Naegi, In It - Siliconera|work=Siliconera|accessdate=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230839/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|archive-date=2015-09-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyoko Kirigiri|\u9727\u5207 \u97ff\u5b50|Kirigiri Ky\u014dko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Erika Harlacher]] (game), [[Caitlin Glass]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/357985813117665280|title=Erika Harlacher on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414012713/https://twitter.com/erikaharlacher/status/357985813117665280|archive-date=2016-04-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The main heroine of the first game. Kyoko is a mysterious woman who seemingly has amnesia but also possesses a cool head and reasoning skills. At the beginning of the game, her talent is unknown, so her presented title is {{nihongo|Ultimate ???|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c???\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"???\"|Super High School Level ???}}.

She always wears a pair of gloves, which is later revealed to be for hiding burns scars she received on her hands when she was younger. She is also the daughter of Hope's Peak Academy's headmaster, Jin Kirigiri. She survives the game and manages to escape from the academy and becomes a member of the Future Foundation.\n\n:In ''Danganronpa 2'', she joins Makoto and Byakuya in confronting Junko's Alter Ego. In ''Danganronpa 3'', she becomes involved in the Monokuma Hunter game alongside other Future Foundation members. She is presumably killed by the poison in her wristband as a result of her forbidden action, \"passing the fourth time limit with Makoto still alive.\" At the end of the series, it is revealed she had survived thanks to an antidote created by Seiko, which slowed the poison's effects and put her in a coma until Mikan revived her. She then becomes a teacher at the new Hope's Peak Academy. She is the protagonist of the spinoff novel series ''Danganronpa Kirigiri'', where she, along with her friend Yui, become involved in a deadly game in an abandoned hotel.\n\n;{{nihongo|Byakuya Togami|\u5341\u795e \u767d\u591c|Togami Byakuya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Akira Ishida]]|Jason Wishnov (game), [[Josh Grelle]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=71233166&postcount=461|title=NeoGAF|website=NeoGAF|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412024351/http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=71233166&postcount=461|archive-date=2016-04-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The successor of a highly successful family corporation who considers himself superior to all the other students in the academy. He is initially cold towards others, seeing them as competition and, as he hates losing, initially refuses to cooperate with their attempts at escaping and investigating. He soon identifies Makoto as a potential competitor, and after the second murder, alters the crime scene as a test for Makoto. Eventually, he becomes more amicable to the group, especially after Sakura's death. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape from the academy and becomes a member of the Future Foundation. His title is {{nihongo|Ultimate Affluent Progeny|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5fa1\u66f9\u53f8\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Onz\u014dshi\"|Super High School Level Scion}}.

In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', he comes to Towa City to rescue Komaru and gives her a Hacking Gun, but gets captured by the Warriors of Hope and is used as a hostage, eventually getting rescued with the help of Komaru and Toko.

Toko switches between the two whenever she sneezes, or if the normal Toko passes out, usually due to the sight of blood, allowing Jack to take control. The two personalities share knowledge and emotions, such as their disturbing crush on Byakuya, but their memories are separate from each other. As such, Jack is the only one of the group who has memories of the past two years. She is one of the survivors that manages to escape from the academy.

She is sent to Towa City to serve as an escort for Komaru, whom she eventually befriends, as well as to search for Byakuya, who has been captured. She reappears alongside Komaru in ''Danganronpa 3'', where they both confront Monaca.\n\n;{{nihongo|Aoi Asahina|\u671d\u65e5\u5948 \u8475|Asahina Aoi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Chiwa Sait\u014d]]|[[Cassandra Lee Morris]] (game), [[Felecia Angelle]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/SoCassandra/status/433824394763202560|title=Cassandra Lee Morris on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411111456/https://twitter.com/SoCassandra/status/433824394763202560|archive-date=2016-04-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:Nicknamed \"Hina\" in the English version.

A charismatic [[gyaru]] fashion model who has modeled for many popular magazines. She is thought to have been killed by Monokuma near the start of the game, having been impaled by several spears after assaulting Monokuma as punishment for breaking the school rules. It is soon revealed that she is actually the true mastermind behind the events of the game, who had erased the memories of all the students and put them in this death game. The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair. The strangeness of her true persona is also compounded by her having to play the role of Monokuma, who has a drastically different personality from her own, as well as the stress of running the Mutual Killing Game by herself without any kind of support. By the time the survivors confront her, it is said that Junko has gone completely insane, her original personality long since lost in her psychosis. She is also the cause of the current state of the school and the world, having manipulated and brainwashed the school's disgruntled reserve course students into rioting over their unfair treatment, which the school desperately tried to cover up until it spilled out into the outside world and caused a worldwide uprising against those perceived as special or privileged. When her plans are foiled by Makoto's dedication to never give up hope, she begins to revel in the ultimate form of despair and commits suicide by subjecting herself to a combination of the executions she inflicted on the other students. At the last second before her death, she becomes bored with despair and dies without knowing the despair of death she was so excited about mere seconds ago. Her body is then dismembered by several members of Ultimate Despair and the parts grafted onto their bodies.

She attempts to get the remaining students to graduate so that her personality can take over the real world bodies of those that died within the virtual world, but she is ultimately thwarted by Hajime Hinata and the other students, being destroyed when the virtual world is shut down. Her avatar appears as a fully three-dimensional giant version possessing a video cell phone that she uses to communicate with the students in the virtual world. She reveals that, after having failed twice, she doesn't feel despair at her defeat, just disappointment, which she had earlier claimed to be the one emotion that she hates above all else since it can't be used constructively in any way.\n\n;{{nihongo|Mukuro Ikusaba|\u6226\u5203 \u3080\u304f\u308d|Ikusaba Mukuro}}\n:{{voiced by|Megumi Toyoguchi|[[Amanda Celine Miller]] (game), [[Jamie Marchi]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n:The elusive sixteenth student of Hope's Peak Academy, who the others only become aware of when she is announced as the sixth murder victim.

It is revealed that Mukuro was actually Junko's twin sister and one of the Super High School Level Despair Students and was disguised as Junko at the beginning of the killing game. However, Junko became bored with the original plan and killed Mukuro on a whim after her sister betrayed her. In the alternative story depicted in the ''Danganronpa IF'' digital novel included with ''Danganronpa 2'', Mukuro is saved from being killed by Junko thanks to Makoto and decides to turn against Junko and help everyone escape from the academy alive once she realizes that Junko is beyond saving. During the novel, it is revealed that Mukuro does not share Junko's nihilist philosophy and only involved herself with Ultimate Despair because she loved Junko too much to abandon her. She also has a crush on Makoto, since he was not intimidated by her military background and talked to her like a normal person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Alter Ego|\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30a8\u30b4|Arut\u0101 Ego}}\n:{{voiced by|K\u014dki Miyata|Dorothy Elias-Fahn (game), [[Kara Edwards]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n:An [[artificial intelligence]] program left behind by Chihiro following his death.

Afterwards, Alter Ego asks Makoto and Kyoko to help connect him to the school network so he can find out more, but he is soon discovered by Monokuma and is destroyed by a bulldozer following the fourth trial. However, he manages to leave behind a virus in the network which helps save Makoto when Monokuma attempts to execute him.

However, with his investigative skills, he manages to help solve the murder mysteries, and even uncovers the truth behind Jabberwock Island being a simulated reality. He also discovers that he was originally part of the Reserve Course, a section of Hope's Peak Academy for students without Ultimate talents that was built to help save the school from its approaching bankruptcy through its exorbitant entry fees. Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents. Due to this combination of talents, Hajime's ability to empathize and take joy in the people around him was removed as well. Under his new persona Izuru Kamukura, the {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}, he grew bored with the world due to being unable to relate to anyone and was manipulated by Junko into being present at the prototype killing game, the killing of Hope's Peak Academy's student council, where the event was blamed on him to incite the events that destroyed human civilization. Despite learning of his past and Izuru, Hajime manages to think for himself and help the others delete Alter Ego Junko. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape to the real world, deciding to live on as Hajime and look for a way to try to restore those who had died within the virtual world. He is briefly seen during the epilogue of ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' as Izuru, ripping out parts of Kurokuma and Shirokuma before he is sent to Jabberwock Island. At the end of ''Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc'', it is revealed that Izuru, having never actually been part of Ultimate Despair, had been freed of Junko's manipulations by Chiaki's death which, when combined with being blamed for the prototype killing game, caused Izuru to enact a revenge scheme that would see Junko utterly erased from existence, which succeeds when Hajime deletes Alter Ego Junko. In ''Danganronpa 3: Hope Arc'',  Hajime is revealed to have retained his own memories and the talents he gained as Izuru and used them to revive everyone who died in the virtual world, managing to stop Ryota from using his hope video before taking him with everyone towards a new future.

Chiaki quickly befriended Hajime and was unanimously elected class representative after bringing video games to the class to help everyone bond. However, it was because of these traits that she was chosen to be executed by Junko in order to drive the rest of her class into becoming Remnants of Despair, forced to go through a dungeon filled with deadly traps before being skewered to death. It is her death that breaks Izuru free of Junko's control, causing the once-apathetic genius to begin planning his revenge.\n:Chiaki is the only student of Class 77-B who stays dead permanently, as she was physically killed by Junko, compared to the other victims who died within the simulation, fell into comas, and were subsequently revived by Hajime. The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto.

When a Monokuma robot attacks her, she is given a Hacking Gun by Byakuya and attempts to flee the city with the Future Foundation. However, she is caught by the Warriors of Hope and is forced to play in their Demon Hunting game, meeting up with Toko along the way. After facing countless trials, growing stronger as a person, it is eventually revealed that the purpose of her trials were part of Monaca's plan to mold her into becoming Junko's successor. However, with the support of Toko, Komaru regains her hope, ultimately deciding to stay in Towa City to help its citizens. She later reappears in ''Danganronpa 3'', once again working with Toko to stop Monaca.

Junko, on a whim, manipulated the children's emotions and ultimately drove them into despair for fun. The Warriors control the Monokuma robots attacking the city. Their plan is to take over the world by murdering all the adults who they call \"Demons\" and create a paradise for children. Their titles are based on elementary school subjects.

Following her defeat, she is rescued by Nagito, who inspires her to become the next Junko. She reappears in ''Danganronpa 3'', killing Miaya Gekkogahara and replacing her with a robot that she controls.

Prior to entering the game, much like everyone else, Kaede was an ordinary individual who willingly had her previous life's memories erased in order to compete on the killing show with a talent and fake background.

He does not get along with Kokichi, as Kokichi often teases Keebo due to his nature of not understanding jokes and sarcasm, and often ridicules his possibilities, which annoys Keebo to no end since he is a strong defender of robot rights and an opposer of robophobia. Throughout the game, he hears a voice in his head telling him what to do, and often listens to said voice. However, after his ahoge is destroyed in Chapter 5, he ponders the nature of hope and despair and notes the absence of the voice inside his head, subsequently going on a destructive rampage and leaving Shuichi and the remaining survivors with only until dawn to unearth the Mastermind of the killing game. Keebo is later revealed to be a creation of the Danganronpa reality show production team, with his past memories of Professor Iidabashi having all been lies. Keebo temporarily becomes the playable character in Chapter 6, before having his A.I. erased and replaced with the audience to vote on the fate of the killing game show at the end of the trial.

After blackmailing Kaito through saving his life, the two conspired together to create a virtually unsolvable murder and make it impossible for the game to continue.

He is a strange, remote-controlled [[teddy bear]] who proclaims himself to be the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy and initiates a life of mutual killing among the students. He has various copies of himself throughout the academy and will punish anyone that attempts to attack him or breaks the academy's rules.\n\nVisually, Monokuma is divided into two halves. Seen from the front his left half is a cute white teddy bear with black details and grey shading; his right half has black fur and adds red as a spot color applied to his eye\nto contribute to his sadistic appearance together with an evil smirk.\n\nThe identity of Monokuma's controller, as well as his motives for bringing the students together, are central to the mysteries that the students must investigate. It is revealed that Monokuma is actually a series of robots created by Monaca Towa for an army that Junko Enoshima used. In the first two games, Monokuma was used as a proxy for Junko in her trials; in ''Another Episode'', he is a series of different types of enemies; in ''Danganronpa 3'', he is under the control of Kazuo Tengan to force Ryota Mitarai into brainwashing the entire world for the sake of hope. He is the only returning character in ''Danganronpa V3'' as a part of the Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles, now controlled by Tsumugi Shirogane and accompanied by the Monokuma Kubs.\n\n==''Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc''==\n<!-- The NIS America release uses \"Ultimate\" in place of \"Super High School Level\".

An ordinary high school student who was accepted to the academy by raffle. He has no spectacular talents, aside from his belief that he is a bit more optimistic than most people, and was given the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}} due to winning the lottery. Ironically, he often falls prey to bad luck more often than not. It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}. He manages to escape from the academy alive and joins an organization called the Future Foundation, dedicated to rebuilding the world and fighting against Junko's legacy.\n\n:During the events of ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair|Danganronpa 2]]'', he and the other survivors attempt to rehabilitate some of the Remnants of Despair by placing them inside a virtual world which would rewrite their memories of being Ultimate Despair students. However, because of a virus containing Junko's Alter Ego, the world is turned into another killing game, prompting Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya to eventually enter the virtual world themselves to help the surviving students activate a shutdown sequence to stop Junko once and for all. Makoto also appears in ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls|Danganronpa Another Episode]]''. He returns as the protagonist of ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School|Danganronpa 3]]'', where he becomes involved in Monokuma's Monokuma Hunter game. His forbidden action is \"running in the hallway.\" After surviving the Monokuma Hunter game, Makoto becomes the headmaster of the rebuilt Hope's Peak Academy.<ref name=\"anotherepappearance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Has Danganronpa 1's Hero, Makoto Naegi, In It - Siliconera|work=Siliconera|accessdate=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230839/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|archive-date=2015-09-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyoko Kirigiri|\u9727\u5207 \u97ff\u5b50|Kirigiri Ky\u014dko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Erika Harlacher]] (game), [[Caitlin Glass]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/357985813117665280|title=Erika Harlacher on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414012713/https://twitter.com/erikaharlacher/status/357985813117665280|archive-date=2016-04-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The main heroine of the first game.

She always wears a pair of gloves, which is later revealed to be for hiding burns scars she received on her hands when she was younger. She is also the daughter of Hope's Peak Academy's headmaster, Jin Kirigiri. She survives the game and manages to escape from the academy and becomes a member of the Future Foundation.\n\n:In ''Danganronpa 2'', she joins Makoto and Byakuya in confronting Junko's Alter Ego. In ''Danganronpa 3'', she becomes involved in the Monokuma Hunter game alongside other Future Foundation members. She is presumably killed by the poison in her wristband as a result of her forbidden action, \"passing the fourth time limit with Makoto still alive.\" At the end of the series, it is revealed she had survived thanks to an antidote created by Seiko, which slowed the poison's effects and put her in a coma until Mikan revived her. She then becomes a teacher at the new Hope's Peak Academy.

Eventually, he becomes more amicable to the group, especially after Sakura's death. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape from the academy and becomes a member of the Future Foundation.

A charismatic [[gyaru]] fashion model who has modeled for many popular magazines. She is thought to have been killed by Monokuma near the start of the game, having been impaled by several spears after assaulting Monokuma as punishment for breaking the school rules. It is soon revealed that she is actually the true mastermind behind the events of the game, who had erased the memories of all the students and put them in this death game. The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair. The strangeness of her true persona is also compounded by her having to play the role of Monokuma, who has a drastically different personality from her own, as well as the stress of running the Mutual Killing Game by herself without any kind of support. By the time the survivors confront her, it is said that Junko has gone completely insane, her original personality long since lost in her psychosis. She is also the cause of the current state of the school and the world, having manipulated and brainwashed the school's disgruntled reserve course students into rioting over their unfair treatment, which the school desperately tried to cover up until it spilled out into the outside world and caused a worldwide uprising against those perceived as special or privileged. When her plans are foiled by Makoto's dedication to never give up hope, she begins to revel in the ultimate form of despair and commits suicide by subjecting herself to a combination of the executions she inflicted on the other students. At the last second before her death, she becomes bored with despair and dies without knowing the despair of death she was so excited about mere seconds ago. Her body is then dismembered by several members of Ultimate Despair and the parts grafted onto their bodies.

She attempts to get the remaining students to graduate so that her personality can take over the real world bodies of those that died within the virtual world, but she is ultimately thwarted by Hajime Hinata and the other students, being destroyed when the virtual world is shut down. Her avatar appears as a fully three-dimensional giant version possessing a video cell phone that she uses to communicate with the students in the virtual world.

It is revealed that Mukuro was actually Junko's twin sister and one of the Super High School Level Despair Students and was disguised as Junko at the beginning of the killing game. However, Junko became bored with the original plan and killed Mukuro on a whim after her sister betrayed her. In the alternative story depicted in the ''Danganronpa IF'' digital novel included with ''Danganronpa 2'', Mukuro is saved from being killed by Junko thanks to Makoto and decides to turn against Junko and help everyone escape from the academy alive once she realizes that Junko is beyond saving. During the novel, it is revealed that Mukuro does not share Junko's nihilist philosophy and only involved herself with Ultimate Despair because she loved Junko too much to abandon her. She also has a crush on Makoto, since he was not intimidated by her military background and talked to her like a normal person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Alter Ego|\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30a8\u30b4|Arut\u0101 Ego}}\n:{{voiced by|K\u014dki Miyata|Dorothy Elias-Fahn (game), [[Kara Edwards]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n:An [[artificial intelligence]] program left behind by Chihiro following his death.

Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents.

The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto. During the time skip between Nagito's death in the program and his appearance in ''Danganronpa 3'', he has changed his worldview and is no longer obsessed with talent or hope. He is also once again friendly with his other classmates, especially Hajime, although his fanboy-like tendencies remain, as seen in his excitement over finally meeting Makoto in person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu|\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66|Kuzury\u016b Fuyuhiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (game), [[Aaron Dismuke]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|title=Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Broadcast Dub Cast Announcement|publisher=[[Funimation]].com|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=2016-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730004611/http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|title=Steve Prince - Alright you Danga Rompa fans: Danga Rompa 2... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224804/https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|archive-date=2016-02-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:A wary student who is the successor of the largest [[yakuza]] family in Japan.

However, she is caught by the Warriors of Hope and is forced to play in their Demon Hunting game, meeting up with Toko along the way. After facing countless trials, growing stronger as a person, it is eventually revealed that the purpose of her trials were part of Monaca's plan to mold her into becoming Junko's successor. However, with the support of Toko, Komaru regains her hope, ultimately deciding to stay in Towa City to help its citizens.

Junko, on a whim, manipulated the children's emotions and ultimately drove them into despair for fun. The Warriors control the Monokuma robots attacking the city. Their plan is to take over the world by murdering all the adults who they call \"Demons\" and create a paradise for children. Their titles are based on elementary school subjects.

Following her defeat, she is rescued by Nagito, who inspires her to become the next Junko. She reappears in ''Danganronpa 3'', killing Miaya Gekkogahara and replacing her with a robot that she controls.

After blackmailing Kaito through saving his life, the two conspired together to create a virtually unsolvable murder and make it impossible for the game to continue.

He then traveled all over the world, hunting down serial killers as a sort of vigilante, until he returned to Japan one day and discovered that Takumi was also murdering killers in order to recreate the beauty he saw in Mukuro's massacre. Horrified, Shuji decided that he needed to \"save\" Takumi from himself by any means, even if that means wiping out all of humanity, due to them all being, in his eyes, potential serial killers.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Danganronpa}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Danganronpa}}\n[[Category:Danganronpa|List of Danganronpa characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of video game characters]]\n", "name_user": "185.234.210.219", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(He is also Russian president candidate in April 2020.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Danganronpa_characters"}
