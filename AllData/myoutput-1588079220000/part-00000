Many people [[ethics of eating meat|object to eating meat]] out of respect for [[Sentience|sentient]] life. Such ethical motivations have been codified [[vegetarianism and religion|under various religious beliefs]], as well as [[animal rights]] advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, [[Environmental vegetarianism|environmental]], cultural, [[aesthetic]], [[Economic vegetarianism|economic]], or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an [[ovo-lacto vegetarian]] diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an [[ovo-vegetarian]] diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a [[lacto-vegetarian]] diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A strict vegetarian diet \u2013 referred to as ''[[vegan]]'' \u2013 excludes all [[animal product]]s, including eggs and dairy.

In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural [[taboo]], such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as [[factory farms]], or avoid certain meats, such as [[veal]] or [[foie gras]]. Some people follow vegetarian or [[Veganism|vegan]] diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practices involved in the processing of animals for food. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant [[protein]]. Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain [[Intensive farming|agricultural practices]] surrounding the [[animal husbandry|production]] of meat.\n\n=== Ethics of killing for food ===\n{{POV section|2018|date=April 2018}}\n{{Main|Bioethics}}\nEthical vegetarians believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, especially one who has equal or lesser cognitive abilities than the animals in question, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or [[nutrition]] value is not a sufficient cause.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lindeman M., V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen M. | year = 2000 | title = Measurement of ethical food choice motives | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 55\u201359 | doi = 10.1006/appe.1999.0293 | pmid = 10744892 }}</ref> Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behavior in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive|journal=Environmental Values|year=2001|pages=103\u2013112|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|author=David Benatar}}</ref> [[Jeff McMahan (philosopher)|Jeff McMahan]] proposes that denying the right to life and humane treatment to animals with equal or greater cognitive abilities than mentally disabled humans is an arbitrary and discriminatory practice based on habit instead of logic.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McMahan|first1=Jeff|title=The Ethics of Killing|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not [[Moral equivalence|moral equals]] to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious.

No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable.

Many people [[ethics of eating meat|object to eating meat]] out of respect for [[Sentience|sentient]] life.

Out of the major causes of death studied, only one difference in mortality rate was attributed to the difference in diet, as the conclusion states: \"...vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from [[ischaemic heart disease]] than non-vegetarians, but no associations of a vegetarian diet with other major causes of death were established\".<ref name=\"AJCN metastudy\"/>\n\nIn ''Mortality in British vegetarians'',<ref name=\"AJCN British study\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Key TJ, Appleby PN, Davey GK, Allen NE, Spencer EA, Travis RC | title = Mortality in British vegetarians: review and preliminary results from EPIC-Oxford | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 78 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 533S\u2013538S | year = 2003 | pmid = 12936946 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.3.533S | doi-access = free }}</ref> a similar conclusion is drawn:\n\n<blockquote>British vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population.

This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1\u20131/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that \"the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population\" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.<ref>Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center, ''[http://www.llu.edu/pages/news/today/july2601/llu.html New Adventist Health Study research noted in Archives of Internal Medicine]'', Loma Linda University, July 26, 2001.

The study concluded that \"The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (\u2265 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy.\" However, the study also concluded that \"Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\" It further states that \"This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet.\" In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that \"5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake.\"<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh PN, Sabat\u00e9 J, Fraser GE | title = Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 526S\u2013532S | year = 2003 | pmid = 12936945 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.3.526S | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nStatistical studies, such as comparing [[life expectancy]] with regional areas and local diets in Europe also have found life expectancy considerably greater in southern France, where a low meat, high plant [[Mediterranean diet]] is common, than northern France, where a diet with high meat content is more common.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Trichopoulou A, Orfanos P, Norat T, Bueno-de-Mesquita B, Ock\u00e9 MC, Peeters PH, van der Schouw YT, Boeing H, Hoffmann K, Boffetta P, Nagel G, Masala G, Krogh V, Panico S, Tumino R, Vineis P, Bamia C, Naska A, Benetou V, Ferrari P, Slimani N, Pera G, Martinez-Garcia C, Navarro C, Rodriguez-Barranco M, Dorronsoro M, Spencer EA, Key TJ, Bingham S, Khaw KT, Kesse E, Clavel-Chapelon F, Boutron-Ruault MC, Berglund G, Wirfalt E, Hallmans G, Johansson I, Tjonneland A, Olsen A, Overvad K, Hundborg HH, Riboli E, Trichopoulos D | title = Modified Mediterranean diet and survival: EPIC-elderly prospective cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 330 | issue = 7498 | page = 991 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15820966 | pmc = 557144 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38415.644155.8F | lay-url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/04/050425111008.htm  }}</ref>\n\nA study by the Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine, and Institute of Physiological Chemistry looked at a group of 19 vegetarians (lacto-ovo) and used as a comparison a group of 19 omnivorous subjects recruited from the same region.

In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural [[taboo]], such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as [[factory farms]], or avoid certain meats, such as [[veal]] or [[foie gras]]. Some people follow vegetarian or [[Veganism|vegan]] diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practices involved in the processing of animals for food. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant [[protein]]. Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain [[Intensive farming|agricultural practices]] surrounding the [[animal husbandry|production]] of meat.\n\n=== Ethics of killing for food ===\n{{POV section|2018|date=April 2018}}\n{{Main|Bioethics}}\nEthical vegetarians believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, especially one who has equal or lesser cognitive abilities than the animals in question, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or [[nutrition]] value is not a sufficient cause.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lindeman M., V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen M. | year = 2000 | title = Measurement of ethical food choice motives | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 55\u201359 | doi = 10.1006/appe.1999.0293 | pmid = 10744892 }}</ref> Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behavior in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive|journal=Environmental Values|year=2001|pages=103\u2013112|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|author=David Benatar}}</ref> [[Jeff McMahan (philosopher)|Jeff McMahan]] proposes that denying the right to life and humane treatment to animals with equal or greater cognitive abilities than mentally disabled humans is an arbitrary and discriminatory practice based on habit instead of logic.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McMahan|first1=Jeff|title=The Ethics of Killing|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not [[Moral equivalence|moral equals]] to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious.

According to the [[Worldwatch Institute]], \"Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02 |title=United States Leads World Meat Stampede|publisher=WorldWatch Institute |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517050751/http://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02/ |archivedate=17 May 2008}}</ref> According to estimates in 2016, adoption of vegetarianism would contribute substantially to global healthcare and environmental savings.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Springmann |first1=Marco |last2=Godfray |first2=H.C.J. |last3=Raynar |first3=Mike  |last4=Scarborough |first4=Peter |date=9 February 2016 |title= Analysis and valuation of the health and climate change cobenefits of dietary change |url= https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2016/03/16/1523119113.full.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  |volume=113 |issue=15 |pages=4146\u20134151 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1523119113 |pmid=27001851 |pmc=4839446 |access-date=28 May 2019 |bibcode=2016PNAS..113.4146S }}</ref>\n\nAn ad shown during the [[2020 Super Bowl]] disparaged the ingredients, such as [[methyl cellulose]], used in the plant-based meat in a competitor's vegetarian burger with a [[spelling bee]] scenario and the motto, \"If you can't spell it, you probably shouldn't be eating it.\" The [[Sierra Club]] pointed out fallacies in the ad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Super Bowl Ad Looks to Score Points Against Plant-Based Meat |url=https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/super-bowl-ad-looks-score-points-against-plant-based-meat |website=Sierra Club |accessdate=12 February 2020 |language=en |date=6 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nPrejudice researcher Gordon Hodson observes that vegetarians and vegans frequently face [[discrimination]] where eating meat is held as a cultural norm.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Prejudice Against \"Group X\" (Asexuals)|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/without-prejudice/201209/prejudice-against-group-x-asexuals|magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|last=Hodson|first=Gordon|date=September 1, 2012|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Gender===\nA 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organisation concluded that \"of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Joanne McAllister Smart|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iggAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The gender gap: if you're a vegetarian, odds are you're a woman.
