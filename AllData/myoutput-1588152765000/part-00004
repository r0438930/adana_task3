In the process industry, a [[Symbolic language (engineering)|standard set of symbols]] is used to prepare drawings of processes. The instrument symbols used in these drawings are generally based on [[International Society of Automation]] (ISA) Standard S5.1\n# The primary schematic drawing used for laying out a [[process control]] installation.\n\nThey usually contain the following information:\n\n* Mechanical equipment, including:\n**[[Pressure vessel|Pressure vessels]], columns, tanks, [[Pump|pumps]], [[Compressor|compressors]], [[Heat exchanger|heat exchangers]], [[Furnace|furnaces]], [[Wellhead|wellheads]], fans, [[Cooling tower|cooling towers]], [[Turboexpander|turbo-expanders]], [[Pigging|pig traps]] (see 'symbols' below)\n**[[Rupture disc|Bursting discs]], restriction orifices, strainers and filters, [[Steam trap|steam traps]], moisture traps, sight-glasses, silencers, flares and vents, [[Flame arrester|flame arrestors]], vortex breakers, [[Injector|eductors]]\n\n*Process piping, sizes and identification, including:\n**Pipe classes and piping line numbers\n**Flow directions\n**Interconnections references\n**Permanent start-up, flush and bypass lines\n**Pipelines and flowlines\n**Blinds and spectacle blinds\n**Insulation and heat tracing\n*Process control instrumentation and designation (names, numbers, unique tag identifiers), including:\n**Valves and their types and identifications (e.g. isolation, shutoff, relief and [[safety valve]]s, valve interlocks)\n**Control inputs and outputs ([[sensor]]s and final elements, interlocks)\n**Miscellaneous - vents, drains, [[flange]]s, special fittings, sampling lines, reducers and swages\n*Interfaces for class changes\n*Computer control system\n*Identification of components and subsystems delivered by others\n\nP&IDs are originally drawn up at the design stage from a combination of process flow sheet data, the mechanical process equipment design, and the instrumentation engineering design.  During the design stage, the diagram also provides the basis for the development of system control schemes, allowing for further safety and operational investigations, such as a [[Hazard and operability study]] (HAZOP). To do this, it is critical to demonstrate the physical sequence of equipment and systems, as well as how these systems connect.\n\nP&IDs also play a significant role in the maintenance and modification of the process after initial build. Modifications are red-penned onto the diagrams and are vital records of the current plant design.\n\nThey are also vital in enabling development of;\n*Control and shutdown schemes\n*Safety and regulatory requirements\n*Start-up sequences\n*Operational understanding.\n\nP&IDs form the basis for the live mimic diagrams displayed on [[graphical user interface]]s of large [[industrial control system]]s such as [[SCADA]] and [[distributed control system]]s.\n\n==Identification and reference designation==\nBased on STANDARD [[ANSI]]/[[Instrument Society of America|ISA]] S5.1 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14617-6, the P&ID is used for the identification of measurements within the process. The identifications consist of up to 5 letters. The first identification letter is for the measured value, the second is a modifier, 3rd indicates passive/readout function, 4th - active/output function, and the 5th is the function modifier. This is followed by loop number, which is unique to that loop. For instance FIC045 means it is the Flow Indicating Controller in control loop 045. This is also known as the \"tag\" identifier of the field device, which is normally given to the location and function of the instrument. The same loop may have FT045 - which is the flow transmitter in the same loop.\n\n{| class= \"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\"\n|  '''Letter''' || '''Column 1''' (Measured value) || '''Column 2''' (Modifier) || '''Column 3''' (Readout/passive function) || '''Column 4''' (Output/active function) || '''Column 5''' (Function modifier)\n|- \n|A ||Analysis || || Alarm  || ||\n|- \n|B ||Burner, combustion || || User choice || User choice || User choice\n|- \n|C ||User's choice (usually conductivity)|| || || Control || Close\n|- \n|D ||User's choice (usually density) || Difference || || || Deviation\n|- \n|E ||Voltage || || Sensor || ||\n|- \n|F ||Flow rate|| Ratio || || ||\n|- \n|G ||User's choice (usually gaging/gauging) || Gas || Glass/gauge/viewing || ||\n|- \n|H ||Hand || || || || High\n|- \n|I ||Current || || Indicate || ||\n|- \n|J ||Power || Scan ||  || ||\n|- \n|K ||Time, time schedule || Time rate of change || || Control station ||\n|- \n|L ||Level || || Light || || Low\n|- \n|M ||User's choice || || || || Middle / intermediate\n|- \n|N ||User's choice (usually torque) || || User choice || User choice || User choice\n|- \n|O ||User's choice || || Orifice || || Open\n|- \n|P ||Pressure || || Point/test connection || ||\n|- \n|Q ||Quantity || Totalize/integrate || Totalize/integrate || ||\n|- \n|R ||Radiation || || Record || || Run\n|- \n|S ||Speed, frequency || Safety (Non SIS (S5.1))||  || Switch || Stop\n|- \n|T ||Temperature || || || Transmit ||\n|- \n|U ||Multivariable || || Multifunction || Multifunction ||\n|- \n|V ||Vibration, mechanical analysis || || || Valve or damper ||\n|- \n|W ||Weight, force || || Well or probe || ||\n|-\n|X ||User's choice (usually on-off valve as XV) || X-axis || Accessory devices, unclassified || Unclassified || Unclassified\n|-\n|Y ||Event, state, presence || Y-axis || || Auxiliary devices ||\n|-\n|Z ||Position, dimension || Z-axis or Safety Instrumented System  || || Actuator, driver or unclassified final control element ||\n|-\n|}\n\nFor reference designation of any equipment in industrial systems the standard [[IEC 61346]] (''Industrial systems, installations and equipment and industrial products \u2014 Structuring principles and reference designations'') can be applied.
