Barbara Messenger ([[Barbara Eden]]) is the younger wife of wealthy retired industrialist Lee Messenger ([[Ralph Bellamy]]) who is dying of cancer. She develops an attraction to hydraulics engineer Sam Harrison ([[Dan Haggerty]]), who is visiting his friend Gus Garver ([[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]]), a retired engineer acting as Chairman of the condominium homeowners association whose wife Carolyn ([[Virginia Leith]]) is recovering from a stroke in the hospital. Sam is the one who first discovers the cracks in the building's foundation and notices the poor materials and workmanship characterizing the construction of the building.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack Messenkott ([[Don Galloway]]), a middle-aged man and his emotionally fragile younger wife Thelma ([[Ana Alicia]]) are an unhappily married couple: Jack is frustrated with Thelma and does not share her love of the natural environment surrounding the condominium while he prefers spending time playing tennis. Julian Higbee ([[Larry Bishop]]), a playboy and the sleazy manager of Silver Sands, is married to the beautiful Lorrie ([[Mimi Maynard]]) but is having an affair with nurse Bobbie Fish ([[Carlene Watkins]]).\n\nSam begins working closely with Gus, the Messengers, former CIA agent Henry Churchbridge ([[Richard Anderson]]) and his wealthy aristocratic Italian wife Carlotta ([[Linda Cristal]]) to try to make unscrupulous construction magnate Marty Liss ([[Stuart Whitman]]) pay for a seawall and other repairs that might help provide reinforcement for the building. The residents of Silver Sands do not realize that Liss and his construction operation are a front to launder syndicate money and that construction of the condominium was the result of these endeavors. Liss cut corners on the building's construction in order to pocket some of the budget for the construction costs for himself.\n\n===Part 2===\nAs Sam and Gus try to raise the consciousness of the other Silver Sands residents regarding the potential safety issues concerning the building, they must eventually deal with the impending arrival of the deadly Hurricane Ella. Conlaw ([[Nehemiah Persoff]]), a ruthless Miami mobster that Marty Liss works for who financed the construction of Silver Sands, is outraged when he learns Liss embezzled money from the construction budget for his own personal gain, especially since his elderly mother Mrs. Conlaw ([[Nedra Volz]]) is living in the building. Meanwhile, Lorrie and Bobbie are both fed up with Julian and turn to each other for emotional support; when Lorrie mentions to Bobbie that she is leaving Julian once and for all, Julian walks in on them and Lorrie stands up to him and both women walk out on Julian for good.\n\nAs the storm approaches with winds of 130 miles an hour, most of the residents vacate to the mainland for safety, while other residents who refuse to vacate decide to stay behind and throw a \"Hurricane Party\". Hurricane Ella powerfully generates a storm surge that strikes Fiddler Key and crashes into the condominium, causing the building to crumble into the ocean. A guilt-stricken Marty Liss commits suicide as he overhears the horrible events of the storm being reported on the radio. One month later, Gus's wife is still recovering at the hospital; Henry and Carlotta Churchbridge have relocated to Switzerland to begin a new life; Barbara and Sam are reunited in Fiddler Key and, still shocked by the destruction of Silver Sands Condominium, they realize they must continue to live their lives with the after-effects of Hurricane Ella.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Cinader]] had a real challenge to create hurricane-like forces on a beautiful sunny California day. Combining the forces of the [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]] in the use of three fire engines, a deluge truck, a portable deluge gun and eight firemen, Cinader was able to pump 9,500 gallons of water per minute into the lake toward the boat housing the cast; with the aid of special effects coordinator Dave Lopez and his crew, water cannons, large wind machines, wave and rain-making machines were all put into action. Although the skies were blue and cloudless, and the sunshine was enough to burn the skin, the result was a stormy, dark effect with crashing, water-swollen waves which ultimately capsized the boat. Much of this equipment was driven to the Florida location also to be used in creating dramatic hurricane scenes at the actual condominium site.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19800122&id=S60cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1WcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6300,3024588 Sarasota Herald Tribune], retrieved January 28, 2015</ref>\n\nThe interiors and the exterior of the condominium were duplicated in miniature size for the hurricane scenes.
