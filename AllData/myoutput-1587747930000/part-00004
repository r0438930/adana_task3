Like its counterpart [[pirate radio]], the term pirate TV lacks a specific universal interpretation. It implies a form of [[broadcasting]] that is unwelcome by the licensing authorities within the territory where its [[signal (electronics)|signals]] are received, especially when the country of [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is the same as the country of reception. When the area of transmission is not a country, or when it is a country and the transmissions are not illegal, those same broadcast signals may be deemed illegal in the country of reception. Therefore, \"pirate TV\" can mean many things to many people. Pirate [[television station]]s may also be known as \"bootleg TV\", or confused with licensed [[low-power broadcasting]] (LPTV) or [[amateur television]] (ATV) services.\n\n==History==\nPirate Television stations are not as abundant in the United States or UK as pirate radio stations are. Only since 2004 has the technology for pirate television stations become easier to obtain and construct, due to advances in technologies and the availability of equipment.\n\nThe first pirate TV station in the US was Lanesville TV, launched in 1972, the broadcast station of video pioneers, the [[Videofreex]].<ref>http://www.skipblumberg.com/website/Bio_files/VideoPioneerSBJFVInt.pdf</ref>\n\nIn April 1978, a weekend broadcast on Channel 7 in [[Syracuse, New York]] called \"Lucky 7\" captured headlines across the nation. \"[[Lucky 7 (pirate TV station)|Lucky 7]]\" broadcast episodes of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and the [[pornographic movie]] ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and ''[[Behind the Green Door]]''. The source of the transmission was not identified, but it was speculated in an article in the ''New York Times'' that the signal may have been transmitted from the area of [[Syracuse University]], as the signal was strongest in that area.<ref>{{cite news |title=F.C.C Hunts an Illicit TV Station That Pirated Some Notable Shows |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 19, 1978 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/19/archives/fcc-hunts-an-illicit-tv-station-that-pirated-some-notable-shows.html |url-access=limited }}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\nThere are several techniques for pirate TV broadcasting, most of which have been made very difficult, or obsolete, by better security measures and the move to [[digital television]].\n\n===Relay hijack (analogue)===\nMany analogue relay transmitters would \"listen\" to a more powerful main transmitter and relay the signal verbatim. If the main transmitter ceases broadcasting (for example, if a channel closes down overnight) then a pirate signal on the same frequency as the main transmitter could cause the relay to \"wake up\" and relay unauthorized programming instead. Typically this would be done by outputting a very weak RF signal within the immediate vicinity of the relay: for example, a video cassette recorder (such as a 12v system designed for use in trucks) sending its signal to a home-made antenna pointed at the relay. As the pirate signal is relatively weak, the source can be difficult to locate if it is well hidden.\n\nA significant benefit of this attack is that the potential viewers do not have to re-tune their televisions to view the content. The content simply appears on an existing channel, after close-down.\n\nThis attack is generally now prevented by the channels broadcasting 24 hours per day (e.g. showing [[test card]]s instead of closing down), by using satellite feeds instead of repeating terrestrial signals, by electronic security to lock the relay to the authorised source, or by the switch to digital television.\n\nUnsecured analogue satellite transponders have also been reported to have been hijacked in a similar manner.\n\n===Source hijack (analogue or digital)===\nIn this scenario, a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] is performed upon the source material, such that authorized official transmissions are fed with unauthorized programming from the central studio or play-out facility. For example, a link feed (e.g. outside broadcast) is hijacked by a stronger pirate signal, or pre-recorded media (such as videotapes or hard drives) are swapped over for unauthorised content. This attack would generally have to be performed by an [[insider]] or by gaining access to studio facilities by [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]].\n\n===Unauthorized transmitter (analogue)===\nAs with most [[pirate radio]] stations, reasonably powerful VHF/UHF transmitters can be built relatively easily by any sufficiently experienced electronics hobbyist, or imported from a less strict country. The primary challenge to this technique is finding a suitable yet inconspicuous vantage point for the transmission antenna, and the risk of getting caught. If the pirate signal is strong enough to be received directly, it will also be strong enough to be tracked down.\n\n===Unauthorized multiplex (digital)===\nThe advent of [[digital television]] makes pirate television broadcasting more difficult. Channels are broadcast as part of a [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] that carries several channels in one signal, and it is almost impossible to insert an unauthorized channel into an authorized multiplex, or to re-activate an off-air channel. In order to broadcast an unauthorized digital TV channel, not only must the perpetrator build or obtain a VHF/UHF transmitter, he must also build or obtain, and configure, the equipment and software to digitally encode the signal and then create a stand-alone multiplex to carry it.\n\nIn Spain, in major provincial capital cities, usually operates one or more than one pirate TV digital multiplex. Some multiplexes started to operate after digital switch-over migrating pirate channels from analogue pirate television to DVB-T digital multiplexes.\n\nSince shortly after digital switch-over and still today in secondary cities, some channels broadcast by means of a DVB-T transmitter with four analog input sources (in this case, four tuned satellite receivers connected by composite video cable) and then to amplifier, and digital signal is feed to antenna or tower. This method is the one used by most pirate TV channels. However, over the years and due to economic returns, some have begun broadcasting almost professionally. New equipment that they have been installing since three years ago allows remultiplexing of DVB-S programs into DVB-T multiplexes and most parameters can be configured at will.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1367929|title=mundoplus.tv \u2022 Ver Tema - Canales piratas en la TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, its number has been increasing in Madrid and in Valencia,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mondigital.cat/forum/viewtopic.php?p=87213|title=TDT PA\u00cdS VALENCI\u00c0 - P\u00e0gina 83 - M\u00f3nDigital.CAT|website=www.mondigital.cat|language=es}}</ref> for example, and, as of March 2016, there are more than ten DVB-T pirate multiplex in Madrid metropolitan area<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1364359|title=mundoplus.tv \u2022 Ver Tema - Canales piratas en la TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> transmitting without authorization with programming ranging from [[divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_videncia.php|title=mundoplus.tv :: Zona TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> or [[fundamentalist Christian]] to [[community television]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_locales.php|title=mundoplus.tv :: Zona TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> (which isn't regulated in Spain as of 2016).\n\nIn other countries, there are reports of pirate TV digital multiplexes, but they are very rare and usually suspected to have been false reports, mistaking [[signal overspill|overspill]] from authorized multiplexes in neighboring regions or nearby foreign countries. Viewing numbers may be much smaller than analogue pirate TV since re-tuning a digital television may be an entirely automated process which may ignore unauthorized multiplexes, or place such channels in an obscure section of the [[electronic program guide]].\n\n==Stations==\n\n=== Known stations ===\n* '''ABD TV''' - Pirate Children's TV station broadcasting on UHF 32 in Chatswood Sydney Australia in 1996.

Like its counterpart [[pirate radio]], the term pirate TV lacks a specific universal interpretation. It implies a form of [[broadcasting]] that is unwelcome by the licensing authorities within the territory where its [[signal (electronics)|signals]] are received, especially when the country of [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is the same as the country of reception. When the area of transmission is not a country, or when it is a country and the transmissions are not illegal, those same broadcast signals may be deemed illegal in the country of reception. Therefore, \"pirate TV\" can mean many things to many people. Pirate [[television station]]s may also be known as \"bootleg TV\", or confused with licensed [[low-power broadcasting]] (LPTV) or [[amateur television]] (ATV) services.\n\n==History==\nPirate Television stations are not as abundant in the United States or UK as pirate radio stations are. Only since 2004 has the technology for pirate television stations become easier to obtain and construct, due to advances in technologies and the availability of equipment.\n\nThe first pirate TV station in the US was Lanesville TV, launched in 1972, the broadcast station of video pioneers, the [[Videofreex]].<ref>http://www.skipblumberg.com/website/Bio_files/VideoPioneerSBJFVInt.pdf</ref>\n\nIn April 1978, a weekend broadcast on Channel 7 in [[Syracuse, New York]] called \"Lucky 7\" captured headlines across the nation. \"[[Lucky 7 (pirate TV station)|Lucky 7]]\" broadcast episodes of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and the [[pornographic movie]] ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and ''[[Behind the Green Door]]''. The source of the transmission was not identified, but it was speculated in an article in the ''New York Times'' that the signal may have been transmitted from the area of [[Syracuse University]], as the signal was strongest in that area.<ref>{{cite news |title=F.C.C Hunts an Illicit TV Station That Pirated Some Notable Shows |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 19, 1978 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/19/archives/fcc-hunts-an-illicit-tv-station-that-pirated-some-notable-shows.html |url-access=limited }}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\nThere are several techniques for pirate TV broadcasting, most of which have been made very difficult, or obsolete, by better security measures and the move to [[digital television]].\n\n===Relay hijack (analogue)===\nMany analogue relay transmitters would \"listen\" to a more powerful main transmitter and relay the signal verbatim. If the main transmitter ceases broadcasting (for example, if a channel closes down overnight) then a pirate signal on the same frequency as the main transmitter could cause the relay to \"wake up\" and relay unauthorized programming instead. Typically this would be done by outputting a very weak RF signal within the immediate vicinity of the relay: for example, a video cassette recorder (such as a 12v system designed for use in trucks) sending its signal to a home-made antenna pointed at the relay. As the pirate signal is relatively weak, the source can be difficult to locate if it is well hidden.\n\nA significant benefit of this attack is that the potential viewers do not have to re-tune their televisions to view the content. The content simply appears on an existing channel, after close-down.\n\nThis attack is generally now prevented by the channels broadcasting 24 hours per day (e.g. showing [[test card]]s instead of closing down), by using satellite feeds instead of repeating terrestrial signals, by electronic security to lock the relay to the authorised source, or by the switch to digital television.\n\nUnsecured analogue satellite transponders have also been reported to have been hijacked in a similar manner.\n\n===Source hijack (analogue or digital)===\nIn this scenario, a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] is performed upon the source material, such that authorized official transmissions are fed with unauthorized programming from the central studio or play-out facility. For example, a link feed (e.g. outside broadcast) is hijacked by a stronger pirate signal, or pre-recorded media (such as videotapes or hard drives) are swapped over for unauthorised content. This attack would generally have to be performed by an [[insider]] or by gaining access to studio facilities by [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]].\n\n===Unauthorized transmitter (analogue)===\nAs with most [[pirate radio]] stations, reasonably powerful VHF/UHF transmitters can be built relatively easily by any sufficiently experienced electronics hobbyist, or imported from a less strict country. The primary challenge to this technique is finding a suitable yet inconspicuous vantage point for the transmission antenna, and the risk of getting caught. If the pirate signal is strong enough to be received directly, it will also be strong enough to be tracked down.\n\n===Unauthorized multiplex (digital)===\nThe advent of [[digital television]] makes pirate television broadcasting more difficult. Channels are broadcast as part of a [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] that carries several channels in one signal, and it is almost impossible to insert an unauthorized channel into an authorized multiplex, or to re-activate an off-air channel. In order to broadcast an unauthorized digital TV channel, not only must the perpetrator build or obtain a VHF/UHF transmitter, he must also build or obtain, and configure, the equipment and software to digitally encode the signal and then create a stand-alone multiplex to carry it.\n\nIn Spain, in major provincial capital cities, usually operates one or more than one pirate TV digital multiplex. Some multiplexes started to operate after digital switch-over migrating pirate channels from analogue pirate television to DVB-T digital multiplexes.\n\nSince shortly after digital switch-over and still today in secondary cities, some channels broadcast by means of a DVB-T transmitter with four analog input sources (in this case, four tuned satellite receivers connected by composite video cable) and then to amplifier, and digital signal is feed to antenna or tower. This method is the one used by most pirate TV channels. However, over the years and due to economic returns, some have begun broadcasting almost professionally. New equipment that they have been installing since three years ago allows remultiplexing of DVB-S programs into DVB-T multiplexes and most parameters can be configured at will.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1367929|title=mundoplus.tv \u2022 Ver Tema - Canales piratas en la TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, its number has been increasing in Madrid and in Valencia,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mondigital.cat/forum/viewtopic.php?p=87213|title=TDT PA\u00cdS VALENCI\u00c0 - P\u00e0gina 83 - M\u00f3nDigital.CAT|website=www.mondigital.cat|language=es}}</ref> for example, and, as of March 2016, there are more than ten DVB-T pirate multiplex in Madrid metropolitan area<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1364359|title=mundoplus.tv \u2022 Ver Tema - Canales piratas en la TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> transmitting without authorization with programming ranging from [[divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_videncia.php|title=mundoplus.tv :: Zona TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> or [[fundamentalist Christian]] to [[community television]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_locales.php|title=mundoplus.tv :: Zona TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> (which isn't regulated in Spain as of 2016).\n\nIn other countries, there are reports of pirate TV digital multiplexes, but they are very rare and usually suspected to have been false reports, mistaking [[signal overspill|overspill]] from authorized multiplexes in neighboring regions or nearby foreign countries. Viewing numbers may be much smaller than analogue pirate TV since re-tuning a digital television may be an entirely automated process which may ignore unauthorized multiplexes, or place such channels in an obscure section of the [[electronic program guide]].\n\n==Stations==\n\n=== Known stations ===\n* '''ABD TV''' - Pirate Children's TV station broadcasting on UHF 32 in Chatswood Sydney Australia in 1996.
