The call brings up bad memories from his disastrous appearance there seven years earlier. It scares him to the point where he cannot sing at rehearsal. Everyone panics thinking he is losing his voice.\n\nHis business manager, Henry Pollack, has a throat specialist Pamela Taylor, look at Giorgio. He at first refuses her, believing her not to be a doctor, but \"a nurse\" because she is a woman. After being scared into seeing her by his manager, she immediately detects that the problem is psychological, not physical. Pamela makes up a serious-sounding name for the condition and gives Giorgio a shot to cure it, which she reveals to Henry is harmless vitamin B12. After reacting to the prick of the needle, Giorgio instantly gets his voice back and proceeds to sing the following day at the [[Hatch Shell]] in Boston.\n\nGiorgio is immediately physically attracted to Pamela, and even though he is married with two children, she agrees to go out on a dinner date. The date does not go well, but Giorgio is persistent, visiting the hospital where Pamela works. His quick thinking helps calm a scared child getting ready for surgery to remove his tonsils, promising ice cream which he delivers after the surgery.  Impressed by his handling of the children, she agrees to another date. She eventually becomes his traveling companion. After spending a romantic week in [[San Francisco]] and the wine country visiting friends of Giorgio, the two eventually fall in love, even though at the start of their relationship he told her this was just \"a fling\" and made her promise not to fall in love with him.  He gains the confidence through his love for her to agree to perform at the Met in the [[Giacomo Puccini]] opera ''[[Turandot]]''. However, because Giorgio refuses to leave his wife, Pamela throws him a kiss and leaves the Met while Giorgio is singing \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" to her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luciano Pavarotti]] as Giorgio Fini\n* [[Kathryn Harrold]] as Pamela Taylor\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Henry Pollack\n* [[Paola Borboni]] as Sister Theresa\n* [[James Hong]] as Kwan\n* Beulah Quo as Mei Ling\n* Norman Steinberg as Dr. Barmen\n* Rod Colbin as Ted Mullane\n* Kathryn Fuller as Faye Kennedy\n* [[Joseph Mascolo]] as Dominic Giordano\n* [[Karen Kondazian]] as Francesca Giordano\n* [[Leona Mitchell]] as Herself\n* [[Kurt Herbert Adler]] as Himself\n* [[Emerson Buckley]] as Himself\n* [[Alexander Courage]] as Conductor, ''Turandot''\n\n==Production==\nIn June 1980 MGM announced they had signed a deal with Pavarotti to star in the movie. \"I have done a lot of television and think I have the experience to do a movie,\" said the singer. \"I will put myself in the hands of those making this but hopefully my sense of humor will come through.<ref name=\"los\">LIGHTS, CAMERA...

These and other antics are the film's attempt to paint Mr. Pavarotti as a good sport, a regular guy. Not too regular, of course - at dependable intervals, Mr. Pavarotti's Giorgio Fini bursts forth with ''[[La Donna e Mobile]]'' from ''[[Rigoletto]]'', or ''[[Nessun Dorma]]'' from ''[[Turandot]],'' or something else designed to demonstrate his musical mastery. He sings ''[[Ave Maria]]'' and ''[[O Sole Mio]]'' and a painfully lighthearted new ballad by Marilyn and Alan Bergman. ''Yes, Giorgio'' wants it both ways, emphasizing Fini's affability and his genius in equal measure. As if that weren't enough, he is also supposed to be a world-class ladies' man. An opening title proclaims that ''this film is dedicated to lovers everywhere.'' [...] Mr. Pavarotti marches happily through ''Yes, Giorgio'' with an air of utter confidence. The story seems to strike him as a perfectly plausible one, and to some slight extent his optimism rubs off on the other players. Without him, there wouldn't be a movie here at all; with him, at least there is a good-natured spectacle. Not even his most ardent fans are liable to love it, but they probably won't find it intolerable, either. There's too much singing here for that. ''Opera puts me to sleep,'' one character is made to tell Giorgio, so that he can reply, ''That is because you have never heard me sing.'' He means it, he means it. ''Yes, Giorgio'' is rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''). Its sexual innuendoes will not disturb children, although adults may find them alarming.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE0DB103BF937A1575AC0A964948260|accessdate=December 11, 2016|title=PAVAROTTI IN 'GIORGIO'|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Janet|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|last=Maslin|location=[[New York City]]|authorlink=Janet Maslin|date=September 24, 1982}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''Yes, Giorgio'' grossed [[United States dollar|$]]2,279,543 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=yesgiorgio.htm |title=Yes, Giorgio (1982)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|location=United States|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film had reportedly been made in part because Gladys Begelman, wife of MGM head of producer David Begelman, was an opera lover.

After spending a romantic week in [[San Francisco]] and the wine country visiting friends of Giorgio, the two eventually fall in love, even though at the start of their relationship he told her this was just \"a fling\" and made her promise not to fall in love with him.  He gains the confidence through his love for her to agree to perform at the Met in the [[Giacomo Puccini]] opera ''[[Turandot]]''. However, because Giorgio refuses to leave his wife, Pamela throws him a kiss and leaves the Met while Giorgio is singing \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" to her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luciano Pavarotti]] as Giorgio Fini\n* [[Kathryn Harrold]] as Pamela Taylor\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Henry Pollack\n* [[Paola Borboni]] as Sister Theresa\n* [[James Hong]] as Kwan\n* Beulah Quo as Mei Ling\n* Norman Steinberg as Dr. Barmen\n* Rod Colbin as Ted Mullane\n* Kathryn Fuller as Faye Kennedy\n* [[Joseph Mascolo]] as Dominic Giordano\n* [[Karen Kondazian]] as Francesca Giordano\n* [[Leona Mitchell]] as Herself\n* [[Kurt Herbert Adler]] as Himself\n* [[Emerson Buckley]] as Himself\n* [[Alexander Courage]] as Conductor, ''Turandot''\n==Production==\nIn June 1980 MGM announced they had signed a deal with Pavarotti to star in the movie. \"I have done a lot of television and think I have the experience to do a movie,\" said the singer. \"I will put myself in the hands of those making this but hopefully my sense of humor will come through.<ref name=\"los\">LIGHTS, CAMERA...

These and other antics are the film's attempt to paint Mr. Pavarotti as a good sport, a regular guy. Not too regular, of course - at dependable intervals, Mr. Pavarotti's Giorgio Fini bursts forth with ''[[La Donna e Mobile]]'' from ''[[Rigoletto]]'', or ''[[Nessun Dorma]]'' from ''[[Turandot]],'' or something else designed to demonstrate his musical mastery. He sings ''[[Ave Maria]]'' and ''[[O Sole Mio]]'' and a painfully lighthearted new ballad by Marilyn and Alan Bergman. ''Yes, Giorgio'' wants it both ways, emphasizing Fini's affability and his genius in equal measure. As if that weren't enough, he is also supposed to be a world-class ladies' man. An opening title proclaims that ''this film is dedicated to lovers everywhere.'' [...] Mr. Pavarotti marches happily through ''Yes, Giorgio'' with an air of utter confidence. The story seems to strike him as a perfectly plausible one, and to some slight extent his optimism rubs off on the other players. Without him, there wouldn't be a movie here at all; with him, at least there is a good-natured spectacle. Not even his most ardent fans are liable to love it, but they probably won't find it intolerable, either. There's too much singing here for that. ''Opera puts me to sleep,'' one character is made to tell Giorgio, so that he can reply, ''That is because you have never heard me sing.'' He means it, he means it. ''Yes, Giorgio'' is rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''). Its sexual innuendoes will not disturb children, although adults may find them alarming.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE0DB103BF937A1575AC0A964948260|accessdate=December 11, 2016|title=PAVAROTTI IN 'GIORGIO'|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Janet|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|last=Maslin|location=[[New York City]]|authorlink=Janet Maslin|date=September 24, 1982}}</ref>\n\n===Box Office===\n''Yes, Giorgio'' grossed [[United States dollar|$]]2,279,543 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=yesgiorgio.htm |title=Yes, Giorgio (1982)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|location=United States|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film had reportedly been made in part because Gladys Begelman, wife of MGM head of producer David Begelman, was an opera lover.
