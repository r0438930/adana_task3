It was the Hurricanes' 62nd season of football. The Hurricanes were led by fourth-year head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] and played their home games at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. They finished the season 12\u20130 overall. They were invited to the [[1988 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] where they defeated [[1987 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], 20-14, to win the school's second national championship.\n\n==Pre-season==\nAfter taking over as head coach in 1984, [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] had a winning record, but some critics questioned whether he could gain a national championship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1985, Miami finished the regular season 10-1, and had a chance to win the national title with Penn State's loss to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. Needing a victory over Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl, Miami jumped out to a 7-0 lead. Tennessee then scored 35 unanswered to derail Miami's title hopes.\n\nIn 1986, Miami achieved a perfect 11-0 regular season record.  Led by [[Heisman Trophy]]-winner [[Vinny Testaverde]], a record breaking offense, and the 5th-ranked defense in the country, #1 Miami was a prohibitive favorite heading into its [[1987 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] matchup against #2 [[1986 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]].  However, Penn State was able to disrupt the Miami passing game and force the Hurricanes into seven turnovers.  Penn State won the national championship with a 14-10 victory over Miami that was sealed when a Testaverde pass from the Penn State 6-yard line was intercepted in the endzone by [[linebacker]] Pete Giftopoulos with 0:18 left in the game.\n\nDespite losing three key players (Testaverde, [[Alonzo Highsmith]], and [[Jerome Brown]]) from the '86 squad who were selected within the first nine picks of the [[1987 NFL Draft]], 1987 was expected to be somewhat of a reloading year for Miami, which began the season ranked 10th in the nation by the AP poll.\n\nBy year's end, the Hurricanes had allowed a mere 125 points. Miami took down six ranked opponents that fall \u2013 including No. 20 Florida, No. 4 FSU, No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 1 Oklahoma. The Canes earned victories by an average of 23.9 points, scoring over 40 points on five different games.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n| rankyear = 1987\n| poll = AP\n| timezone = Eastern\n\n|{{CFB

The October 3 game featured not only high drama, but also an astounding 56 players who would go on to play in the [[National Football League|NFL]].  Miami scored first with a second-quarter field goal, but Florida State, fielding a team many consider to be the best in school history, took control of the game after that.  A 67-yard run by Florida State [[running back]] Sammie Smith was followed by a 1-yard touchdown run from Dayne Williams, giving FSU a 7-3 lead.  A 36-yard field goal from Derek Schmidt pushed the Seminoles' lead to 10-3 at the half.\n\nAfter Schmidt missed a third-quarter field goal wide right, Miami took over, but went three-and-out and was forced to punt.  The ensuing punt by [[Jeff Feagles]] was blocked and returned by Florida State for a touchdown, increasing the Florida State lead to 16-3 (Schmidt missed the extra point).  Miami was forced to punt again, and a big return by FSU's [[Deion Sanders]] put Florida State in position to add another Schmidt field goal to make the score 19-3.\n\nWith Miami having been unable to mount any offense to that point, the Hurricanes looked to be in dire straits late in the third quarter.  Spurred on by an impassioned speech from receiver [[Michael Irvin]], the Hurricanes were able to keep their focus and climbed back into the game when Walsh found a [[streaking]] Melvin Bratton for a 49-yard touchdown.  Miami went for [[two-point conversion|two]], which they converted when Walsh was able to hook up with receiver [[Brian Blades]], trimming the FSU lead to 19-11 heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe final quarter was filled with back-and-forth [[drama]].  Irvin started things off when he was on the receiving end of a 26-yard touchdown pass from Walsh.  With the score now at 19-17, Miami again went for two, which Miami, again, converted, this time on a pass from Walsh to [[Warren Williams (American football)|Warren Williams]].  With the game now tied at 19-19 and its 16-point lead evaporated, Florida State staged a drive of its own, taking the ball down to the Miami 17-yard line before quarterback Danny McManus fumbled the snap, which was recovered by [[Bennie Blades]].  Miami wasted little time in capitalizing on the miscue, as four plays later Walsh hooked up with Irvin for one of the most famous plays in University of Miami history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Walsh walked to the line, read the FSU defense, and called an audible for Irvin, who was appropriately nicknamed \"The Playmaker\" due to his penchant for making big plays.  Walsh took a quick three-step drop and hung the ball up perfectly for Irvin on a fly route.  Irvin was in double coverage, but was able to get behind the coverage, catch the pass, and take it 73-yards for a Miami touchdown.  With 2:22 left to play, Miami led 26-19.\n\nFlorida State would not go meekly, though, as the Seminoles valiantly fought back after taking possession on their own 25-yard line.  Before long, the Seminoles were in the endzone when McManus hit Ronald Lewis on a perfect corner route for 18-yards.  With college football not having [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] at the time, Florida State head coach [[Bobby Bowden]] was faced with a decision: attempt the extra point and settle for a 26-26 tie, or attempt a two-point conversion and go for the win.  Complicating matters was the fact that Schmidt, FSU's kicker, had looked shaky on this day, already missing on a field goal attempt and on an extra point attempt.  Nevertheless, Bowden initially had decided to kick the extra point and settle for the tie, as he had stated{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} when asked before the game what he would if he found himself in this exact predicament.  But after the FSU offense protested and urged their coach to go for the win, Bowden changed his mind and decided to go for the two, betting both FSU's and Miami's national championship hopes on the outcome.  FSU called a pass play.  McManus took the snap, looked for a receiver, and then threw into the right corner of the endzone.  The ball was underthrown and broken up by Miami defensive back Bubba McDowell before it could reach its intended target.  With Miami up 26-25, Florida State attempted an [[onside kick]] on the ensuing kickoff, but Miami recovered the ball with 0:42 left and was able to run out the clock, sealing the Hurricane victory.\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Maryland===\n{{see also|1987 Maryland Terrapins football team}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Miami Hurricanes|Overall record|Last meeting|Result}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6\u20137\n| 1985\n| '''W''' 29\u201322\n|}\n\nHaving successfully negotiated its brutal early season schedule, Miami won its next four games with ease, beating [[1987 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]] (46-16), [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] (48-10), [[1987 East Carolina Pirates football team|East Carolina]] (41-3), and [[1987 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami (Ohio)]] (54-3).\n\n<ref>{{cite web|title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SOUTH; L.S.U.

Oklahoma was a dominant force in college football, winning the national championship in 1985 and losing just one game in each of the preceding two years.  Miami, though, had proven to be the thorn in Oklahoma's side, as the Sooners' losses in '85 and '86 had both come at the hands of Miami.  Now, with the national championship on the line, Miami sought to make it three-losses-in-three-years for Oklahoma, and also their first postseason bowl win under Jimmy Johnson after three straight bowl losses, two in which they struggled and lost their chances to win the national championships.  Further fuel for the fire was provided by the growing personal animosity between former Arkansas player Johnson and Oklahoma head coach [[Barry Switzer]], who was also a former Arkansas player.\n\nMiami's vaunted defense set the tone early, forcing the Sooners to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on their first five possessions.  Meanwhile, Walsh settled into a nice rhythm, putting Miami on the board first with a 30-yard touchdown pass to fullback Melvin Bratton, who caught 9 passes for 102 yards for the game.  Oklahoma got on the board with a second-quarter touchdown to tie things up, but Miami responded with 10 unanswered third quarter points, coming on an Orange Bowl record 56-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by kicker Greg Cox and a 23-yard touchdown pass from Walsh to Irvin.  Oklahoma would add a fourth-quarter touchdown to trim the score to 20-14, but Miami held on for the win and the national championship.  Johnson received a [[Gatorade#The Gatorade shower|Gatorade bath]], which messed his trademark impeccably coiffed hair, and was carried off the field, having finally won \"the big one\" at Miami.\n\nThe Hurricane defense held Oklahoma to just 255 yards of offense, while Walsh's efficient play (18 of 30, 209 yards, 2 touchdowns) paced the Hurricane offense.  Middle linebacker Bernard \"Tiger\" Clark- a backup middle linebacker who was forced to start after starting MLB George Mira Jr. was suspended for failing a drug test- was named the MVP of the Orange Bowl after recording 14 tackles (12 unassisted).\n\nWith the win, Miami completed its first ever undefeated season.  In winning their second national championship, the Canes once again had to go through the nation's top-ranked team at the Orange Bowl, just as they had done in [[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|1983]].\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n===[[College Football All-America Team|Consensus All-Americans]]===\n*Bennie Blades, FS\n*Daniel Stubbs, LE\n\n===Awards finalists===\n'''Bold''' indicates winners\n*'''Bennie Blades''', FS \u2013 '''[[Jim Thorpe Award]]'''<ref>http://football.about.com/cs/history/a/jimthorpeaward.htm</ref>\n*Daniel Stubbs, LE \u2013 [[Outland Trophy]]\n\n===Jack Harding University of Miami MVP Award===\n*Steve Walsh, QB\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{1987 Miami Hurricanes football navbox}}\n{{Miami Hurricanes football navbox}}\n{{College Football National Champion navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1987 Miami Hurricanes Football Team}}\n[[Category:1987 NCAA Division I-A independents football season|Miami]]\n[[Category:Miami Hurricanes football seasons]]\n[[Category:College football national champions]]\n[[Category:Orange Bowl champion seasons]]\n[[Category:College football undefeated seasons]]\n[[Category:1987 in sports in Florida|Miami Hurricanes football]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American college football season}}\n{{Infobox NCAA team season|sport=football\n  |year=1987\n  |team=Miami Hurricanes\n  |image=Miami Hurricanes logo.svg\n  |image_size=125\n  |conference=Independent\n  |division=\n  |short_conf=\n  |CoachRank=1\n  |APRank=1\n  |record=12\u20130\n  |conf_record=\n  |head_coach=[[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]\n  |hc_year=4th\n  |off_coach=[[Gary Stevens (American football)|Gary Stevens]]\n  |oc_year=5th\n  |off_scheme=[[Pro-style offense|Pro-style]]\n  |def_coach=[[Dave Wannstedt]]\n  |dc_year=2nd\n  |def_scheme=[[4\u20133 defense|4\u20133]]\n  |stadium=[[Miami Orange Bowl]]<br>(Capacity: 75,500)\n  |champion=Consensus National Champion<br>Orange Bowl champion\n  |bowl=[[1988 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]\n  |bowl_result= W 20\u201314 vs. [[1987 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]]\n}}\n{{1987 Division I-A independents football standings}}\nThe '''1987 Miami Hurricanes football team''' represented the [[University of Miami]] during the [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season]]. It was the Hurricanes' 62nd season of football. The Hurricanes were led by fourth-year head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] and played their home games at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. They finished the season 12\u20130 overall. They were invited to the [[1988 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] where they defeated [[1987 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], 20-14, to win the school's second national championship.\n\n==Pre-season==\nAfter taking over as head coach in 1984, [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] had a winning record, but some critics questioned whether he could gain a national championship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1985, Miami finished the regular season 10-1, and had a chance to win the national title with Penn State's loss to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. Needing a victory over Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl, Miami jumped out to a 7-0 lead. Tennessee then scored 35 unanswered to derail Miami's title hopes.\n\nIn 1986, Miami achieved a perfect 11-0 regular season record.  Led by [[Heisman Trophy]]-winner [[Vinny Testaverde]], a record breaking offense, and the 5th-ranked defense in the country, #1 Miami was a prohibitive favorite heading into its [[1987 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] matchup against #2 [[1986 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]].  However, Penn State was able to disrupt the Miami passing game and force the Hurricanes into seven turnovers.  Penn State won the national championship with a 14-10 victory over Miami that was sealed when a Testaverde pass from the Penn State 6-yard line was intercepted in the endzone by [[linebacker]] Pete Giftopoulos with 0:18 left in the game.\n\nDespite losing three key players (Testaverde, [[Alonzo Highsmith]], and [[Jerome Brown]]) from the '86 squad who were selected within the first nine picks of the [[1987 NFL Draft]], 1987 was expected to be somewhat of a reloading year for Miami, which began the season ranked 10th in the nation by the AP poll.\n\nBy year's end, the Hurricanes had allowed a mere 125 points. Miami took down six ranked opponents that fall \u2013 including No. 20 Florida, No. 4 FSU, No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 1 Oklahoma. The Canes earned victories by an average of 23.9 points, scoring over 40 points on five different games.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n| rankyear = 1987\n| poll = AP\n| timezone = Eastern\n\n|{{CFB

The October 3 game featured not only high drama, but also an astounding 56 players who would go on to play in the [[National Football League|NFL]].  Miami scored first with a second-quarter field goal, but Florida State, fielding a team many consider to be the best in school history, took control of the game after that.  A 67-yard run by Florida State [[running back]] Sammie Smith was followed by a 1-yard touchdown run from Dayne Williams, giving FSU a 7-3 lead.  A 36-yard field goal from Derek Schmidt pushed the Seminoles' lead to 10-3 at the half.\n\nAfter Schmidt missed a third-quarter field goal wide right, Miami took over, but went three-and-out and was forced to punt.  The ensuing punt by [[Jeff Feagles]] was blocked and returned by Florida State for a touchdown, increasing the Florida State lead to 16-3 (Schmidt missed the extra point).  Miami was forced to punt again, and a big return by FSU's [[Deion Sanders]] put Florida State in position to add another Schmidt field goal to make the score 19-3.\n\nWith Miami having been unable to mount any offense to that point, the Hurricanes looked to be in dire straits late in the third quarter.  Spurred on by an impassioned speech from receiver [[Michael Irvin]], the Hurricanes were able to keep their focus and climbed back into the game when Walsh found a [[streaking]] Melvin Bratton for a 49-yard touchdown.  Miami went for [[two-point conversion|two]], which they converted when Walsh was able to hook up with receiver [[Brian Blades]], trimming the FSU lead to 19-11 heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe final quarter was filled with back-and-forth [[drama]].  Irvin started things off when he was on the receiving end of a 26-yard touchdown pass from Walsh.  With the score now at 19-17, Miami again went for two, which Miami, again, converted, this time on a pass from Walsh to [[Warren Williams (American football)|Warren Williams]].  With the game now tied at 19-19 and its 16-point lead evaporated, Florida State staged a drive of its own, taking the ball down to the Miami 17-yard line before quarterback Danny McManus fumbled the snap, which was recovered by [[Bennie Blades]].  Miami wasted little time in capitalizing on the miscue, as four plays later Walsh hooked up with Irvin for one of the most famous plays in University of Miami history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Walsh walked to the line, read the FSU defense, and called an audible for Irvin, who was appropriately nicknamed \"The Playmaker\" due to his penchant for making big plays.  Walsh took a quick three-step drop and hung the ball up perfectly for Irvin on a fly route.  Irvin was in double coverage, but was able to get behind the coverage, catch the pass, and take it 73-yards for a Miami touchdown.  With 2:22 left to play, Miami led 26-19.\n\nFlorida State would not go meekly, though, as the Seminoles valiantly fought back after taking possession on their own 25-yard line.  Before long, the Seminoles were in the endzone when McManus hit Ronald Lewis on a perfect corner route for 18-yards.  With college football not having [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] at the time, Florida State head coach [[Bobby Bowden]] was faced with a decision: attempt the extra point and settle for a 26-26 tie, or attempt a two-point conversion and go for the win.  Complicating matters was the fact that Schmidt, FSU's kicker, had looked shaky on this day, already missing on a field goal attempt and on an extra point attempt.  Nevertheless, Bowden initially had decided to kick the extra point and settle for the tie, as he had stated{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} when asked before the game what he would if he found himself in this exact predicament.  But after the FSU offense protested and urged their coach to go for the win, Bowden changed his mind and decided to go for the two, betting both FSU's and Miami's national championship hopes on the outcome.  FSU called a pass play.  McManus took the snap, looked for a receiver, and then threw into the right corner of the endzone.  The ball was underthrown and broken up by Miami defensive back Bubba McDowell before it could reach its intended target.  With Miami up 26-25, Florida State attempted an [[onside kick]] on the ensuing kickoff, but Miami recovered the ball with 0:42 left and was able to run out the clock, sealing the Hurricane victory.\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Maryland===\n{{see also|1987 Maryland Terrapins football team}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Miami Hurricanes|Overall record|Last meeting|Result}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6\u20137\n| 1985\n| '''W''' 29\u201322\n|}\n\nHaving successfully negotiated its brutal early season schedule, Miami won its next four games with ease, beating [[1987 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]] (46-16), [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] (48-10), [[1987 East Carolina Pirates football team|East Carolina]] (41-3), and [[1987 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami (Ohio)]] (54-3).\n\n<ref>{{cite web|title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SOUTH; L.S.U.

Oklahoma was a dominant force in college football, winning the national championship in 1985 and losing just one game in each of the preceding two years.  Miami, though, had proven to be the thorn in Oklahoma's side, as the Sooners' losses in '85 and '86 had both come at the hands of Miami.  Now, with the national championship on the line, Miami sought to make it three-losses-in-three-years for Oklahoma, and also their first postseason bowl win under Jimmy Johnson after three straight bowl losses, two in which they struggled and lost their chances to win the national championships.  Further fuel for the fire was provided by the growing personal animosity between former Arkansas player Johnson and Oklahoma head coach [[Barry Switzer]], who was also a former Arkansas player.\n\nMiami's vaunted defense set the tone early, forcing the Sooners to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on their first five possessions.  Meanwhile, Walsh settled into a nice rhythm, putting Miami on the board first with a 30-yard touchdown pass to fullback Melvin Bratton, who caught 9 passes for 102 yards for the game.  Oklahoma got on the board with a second-quarter touchdown to tie things up, but Miami responded with 10 unanswered third quarter points, coming on an Orange Bowl record 56-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by kicker Greg Cox and a 23-yard touchdown pass from Walsh to Irvin.  Oklahoma would add a fourth-quarter touchdown to trim the score to 20-14, but Miami held on for the win and the national championship.  Johnson received a [[Gatorade#The Gatorade shower|Gatorade bath]], which messed his trademark impeccably coiffed hair, and was carried off the field, having finally won \"the big one\" at Miami.\n\nThe Hurricane defense held Oklahoma to just 255 yards of offense, while Walsh's efficient play (18 of 30, 209 yards, 2 touchdowns) paced the Hurricane offense.  Middle linebacker Bernard \"Tiger\" Clark- a backup middle linebacker who was forced to start after starting MLB George Mira Jr. was suspended for failing a drug test- was named the MVP of the Orange Bowl after recording 14 tackles (12 unassisted).\n\nWith the win, Miami completed its first ever undefeated season.  In winning their second national championship, the Canes once again had to go through the nation's top-ranked team at the Orange Bowl, just as they had done in [[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|1983]].\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n===[[College Football All-America Team|Consensus All-Americans]]===\n*Bennie Blades, FS\n*Daniel Stubbs, LE\n\n===Awards finalists===\n'''Bold''' indicates winners\n*'''Bennie Blades''', FS \u2013 '''[[Jim Thorpe Award]]'''<ref>http://football.about.com/cs/history/a/jimthorpeaward.htm</ref>\n*Daniel Stubbs, LE \u2013 [[Outland Trophy]]\n\n===Jack Harding University of Miami MVP Award===\n*Steve Walsh, QB\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{1987 Miami Hurricanes football navbox}}\n{{Miami Hurricanes football navbox}}\n{{College Football National Champion navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1987 Miami Hurricanes Football Team}}\n[[Category:1987 NCAA Division I-A independents football season|Miami]]\n[[Category:Miami Hurricanes football seasons]]\n[[Category:College football national champions]]\n[[Category:Orange Bowl champion seasons]]\n[[Category:College football undefeated seasons]]\n[[Category:1987 in sports in Florida|Miami Hurricanes football]]\n", "name_user": "KingSkyLord", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRoster", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Miami_Hurricanes_football_team"}
