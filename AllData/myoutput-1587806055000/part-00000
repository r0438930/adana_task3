She was the first and, to date, only woman to hold the position of president in Nicaragua.\n\nBorn into a landed family in southern [[Nicaragua]], Chamorro was partially educated in the United States. After returning to her home country, she married and raised a family. Her husband, [[Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro Cardenal]], was a journalist working at his family's newspaper, ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]'', which he later inherited. As a result of his anti-government stance, he was often jailed or exiled, forcing Chamorro to spend a decade following him abroad or visiting him in jail. When he was assassinated in 1978, Chamorro took over the newspaper. Pedro's murder strengthened the Nicaraguan Revolution and his image, as wielded by his widow, became a powerful symbol for the opposition forces. Initially, when the [[Sandinista]]s were victorious over [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], Chamorro fully supported them. She agreed to become part of the provisional government established under the [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] ({{lang-es|Junta de Gobierno de Reconstrucci\u00f3n Nacional}}, JGRN); however, when the Junta began moving in a more radical direction and signed agreements with the [[Soviet Union]], Chamorro resigned and returned to the newspaper.\n\nUnder her direction, ''La Prensa'' continued to criticize the government and its policies despite threats and government-forced shutdowns. When [[Daniel Ortega]] announced that elections would be held in 1990, Chamorro was selected as the candidate for the opposition group known as the [[National Opposition Union]] ({{lang-es|Uni\u00f3n Nacional Opositora}}, UNO). This 14-party alliance ranged from [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[liberalism|liberals]] to [[communism|communists]] and because of idealistic differences had difficulty in devising any political platform other than a promise to end the war. Despite polls indicating a victory for the incumbent Sandinista President Ortega, Chamorro won the [[1990 Nicaraguan general election|election]] on 25 February 1990, becoming the first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female head of state]] in the [[Americas]].\n\nChamorro was sworn into office on 25 April 1990. Chamorro's leadership covered six difficult years marked by economic strife and social unrest, but she was able to compromise with rivals, maintain a constitutional regime, re-establish international banking relationships and end the hyperinflation that had plagued the country for several years.\n\nAfter leaving office on 10 January 1997, Chamorro worked on several international peace initiatives until poor health forced her to retire from public life.\n\n==Early life==\nVioleta Barrios Torres was born on 18 October 1929 in [[Rivas, Nicaragua|Rivas]], a small city near the Nicaraguan border with [[Costa Rica]], to Carlos Jos\u00e9 Barrios Sacasa and Amalia Torres Hurtado.<ref name=\"Pallais (1992)\">{{cite journal|last1=Pallais|first1=Mar\u00eda L|title=Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.

In 1952, on his father's death, Chamorro's husband inherited the newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]''. He took over publishing and under his direction, the paper became a voice of opposition to the Somoza regime. Chamorro Cardenal was frequently jailed between 1952 and 1957 for the content of the paper and in 1957 led a revolt against Somoza. His actions resulted in his exile to Costa Rica, where Chamorro joined him after settling their children with his mother. Two years were spent in Costa Rica, with Pedro writing against the regime and immediately upon their return he was jailed again. Chamorro's life throughout the 1960s and 1970s was a repetitive cycle of reunions with either her husband or children. She followed him; if he was forced to leave, she left the children with family and traveled to be with him; if he was jailed, she was reunited with the children and visited him.{{Sfn|Baldwin|1996|p=100}} Chamorro's earnings from a rental property that her mother had given her gave the couple a steady income. When her husband was [[assassinated]] on 10 January 1978, she took over control of the newspaper.{{Sfn|Leiken|2003|p=74}}\n\nOver the years, Chamorro's family has been split into feuding factions based upon political association. Two of her children, Pedro and Cristiana, worked at ''La Prensa'', although Pedro left Nicaragua in 1984 to join the [[Contras]]. Her other children were active Sandinistas; Claudia was ambassador to Costa Rica and Carlos became the editor of the [[FSLN]] daily newspaper ''[[Barricada (FSLN)|Barricada]]''.  In spite of the conflicting political views of her children, Chamorro encouraged and hosted family dinners during which she insisted political affiliations were temporarily put aside in the interest of family harmony.{{Sfn|Beckman|D'Amico|1995|pp=34\u201336}}\n\n==Rise to power==\nThe assassination of Chamorro's husband sparked the [[Sandinista Revolution]].

One of the most contentious provisions, the one banning [[nepotism]] was conceded by Chamorro. Both sides claimed victory,<ref name=\"CS Monitor\" /> though the Supreme Court issue was still not resolved with the Assembly insisting their appointees were valid and the President refusing to acknowledge them.<ref name=\"New Nicaraguan Constitution\" />\n\nAs in other crises, Chamorro's ability to compromise was pivotal. The executive and legislative branches became more interdependent, but power was shared. The National Assembly prepared the budget, but the president had to be consulted on taxation; Supreme Court vacancies had to be agreed on by both of the other branches of government;{{sfn|Staten|2010|p=132}} and although the president retained the power of veto, the legislature could overturn a veto by a simple majority vote.{{sfn|Bothmann|2015|p=174}} Though some of the changes also included reform of the Code of Criminal Procedures\u2014creating trial by jury, expanding the right of citizens to press charges, and evaluating police authority, among others{{sfn|Arnson|Holiday|1991|p=46}}\u2014failure of the government to investigate past abuses by the police and the military or institute judicial proceedings, granted tacit impunity for those who committed human rights abuses or violence. Though the 1990 Amnesty Law had curtailed some of administration's ability to prosecute,{{sfn|Arnson|Holiday|1991|p=56}} it also lacked the funds, impartial judiciary and possibly the will to seek transitional justice.  [[Sof\u00eda Montenegro]], editor of the Sandinistan paper ''Barricada'' and others have argued that Chamorro would have dealt with past abuse if she could have, but others, like Bishop Bernardo Hombach, are confident that her faith would have required her to forgive. Prosecutions would have prolonged conflict and harsh retaliation would not have brought about the reconciliation and peace she desired.{{sfn|Bothmann|2015|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\n===Gender consequences===\nThough 15 delegates of her parliament (16%) were women, few advances in women's rights were made during Chamorro's administration.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=261}} Chamorro was not a feminist, since her beliefs prevented her from advocating many of the goals of traditional feminism. She was against abortion and questioned cohabitation, contraception and divorce. Cutbacks in public services during her regime, like child care and centers for rehabilitation, led to an increase in low-income women being forced into [[prostitution]] and crime.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=264}} According to a United Nations study, the financial insecurity forced women and adolescents into \"street professions\", elevating security risks and increasing the rate of drop outs, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and prostitution.<ref name=\"prostitution, delinquency, drug use\">{{cite web|last1=Committee on the Rights of the Child|title=Country analysis: Nicaragua: Nicaragua. 10/17/1994|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/4e6a2923d2c6d19f4125615100606318?Opendocument|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=6 September 2015|location=Geneva, Switzerland|date=21 October 1994}}</ref> In addition, austerity measures that eliminated free health care made it difficult for the poor to afford care. The Sandinista Workers Central ({{lang-es|Central Sandinista De Trabajadores}}, CST) stepped in to offer health care and child care to women who could not afford the new government plan.{{sfn|Staten|2010|p=135}} She did support women's rights to become property holders, and saw such ownership as a protection when divorce or widowhood deprived women of a husband's support. Her administration did not actively prepare or encourage women's participation in political life, nor did she appoint women to governmental positions.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=264}}\n\nThe economic policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment outside the home in Nicaragua steadily increased during the same time frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.{{sfn|Chavez Metoyer|2000|p=5}}\n\nThe 1992 Sexual Crime Code modifications resulted in winners and losers. Previously, the Penal Code had the penalty for rape specified as 8 to 12 years in prison (compared to 6 to 14 for simple homicide).<ref name=\"Morgan (1995)\">{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=Martha I.|title=The Bitter and the Sweet: Feminist Efforts to Reform Nicaraguan Rape and Sodomy Laws|journal=University of Miami Inter-American Law Review|date=July 1995|volume=26|issue=3|pages=439\u2013488|url=http://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1379&context=umialr|accessdate=6 September 2015|publisher=University of Miami School of Law|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> However, it also defined some lesser sexual crimes in a way designed to protect the interests of fathers and husbands more than of the women themselves; for example, the penalty for \"kidnapping of a virgin [...] when her guardians were away or without violence\" depended on whether marriage was intended. Victoria Gonz\u00e1lez-Rivera writes that prior to the 1992 changes, rape had been considered a private affair and the law encouraged women to marry their rapists or accept a monetary settlement.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez-Rivera|2011|p=50}} UNO women and FSLN women in the National Assembly joined forces after Chamorro won the election and formed a Commission on Women, Youth, Children and the Family and began to discuss reform of the sexual crimes law. Convincing 18 bipartisan legislators to introduce a reform, they asked for increasing penalties for rape (to 15 to 20 years), decriminalization for abortion if the pregnancy was the result of rape and decriminalization of consensual sodomy. When the final bill passed, the approved version eliminated the exception for abortion for rape victims and not only did not decriminalize sodomy, but increased the scope of the existing law to include \"inducing, promoting or propagandizing\" homosexual conduct.<ref name=\"Morgan (1995)\"/> The new anti-sodomy law was the most repressive law of its type in Latin America,{{sfn|Borland|2006|p=128}} changing the imposed a sentence for \"anyone who induces, promotes, propagandizes, or practices sex among persons of the same sex in a scandalous manner\" to as much as three years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Joe|title=Nicaragua to decriminalise gay sex|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2007/11/16/nicaragua-to-decriminalise-gay-sex/|accessdate=8 April 2017|newspaper=[[PinkNews]]|date=16 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518085413/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2007/11/16/nicaragua-to-decriminalise-gay-sex/|archivedate=18 May 2016|location=London, England}}</ref> Chamorro rejected calls to veto the law and sent it for publication in ''La Gaceta'', a legal requirement for a statute to become law.

'''Violeta Barrios Torres'''; 18 October 1929) is a Nicaraguan politician who served as [[President of Nicaragua]] from 1990 to 1997. She was the first and, to date, only woman to hold the position of president in Nicaragua.\n\nBorn into a landed family in southern [[Nicaragua]], Chamorro was partially educated in the United States. After returning to her home country, she married and raised a family. Her husband, [[Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro Cardenal]], was a journalist working at his family's newspaper, ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]'', which he later inherited. As a result of his anti-government stance, he was often jailed or exiled, forcing Chamorro to spend a decade following him abroad or visiting him in jail. When he was assassinated in 1978, Chamorro took over the newspaper. Pedro's murder strengthened the Nicaraguan Revolution and his image, as wielded by his widow, became a powerful symbol for the opposition forces. Initially, when the [[Sandinista]]s were victorious over [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], Chamorro fully supported them. She agreed to become part of the provisional government established under the [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] ({{lang-es|Junta de Gobierno de Reconstrucci\u00f3n Nacional}}, JGRN); however, when the Junta began moving in a more radical direction and signed agreements with the [[Soviet Union]], Chamorro resigned and returned to the newspaper.\n\nUnder her direction, ''La Prensa'' continued to criticize the government and its policies despite threats and government-forced shutdowns. When [[Daniel Ortega]] announced that elections would be held in 1990, Chamorro was selected as the candidate for the opposition group known as the [[National Opposition Union]] ({{lang-es|Uni\u00f3n Nacional Opositora}}, UNO). This 14-party alliance ranged from [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[liberalism|liberals]] to [[communism|communists]] and because of idealistic differences had difficulty in devising any political platform other than a promise to end the war. Despite polls indicating a victory for the incumbent Sandinista President Ortega, Chamorro won the [[1990 Nicaraguan general election|election]] on 25 February 1990, becoming the first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female head of state]] in the [[Americas]].\n\nChamorro was sworn into office on 25 April 1990.

In 1952, on his father's death, Chamorro's husband inherited the newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]''.

Chamorro Cardenal was frequently jailed between 1952 and 1957 for the content of the paper and in 1957 led a revolt against Somoza. His actions resulted in his exile to Costa Rica, where Chamorro joined him after settling their children with his mother. Two years were spent in Costa Rica, with Pedro writing against the regime and immediately upon their return he was jailed again. Chamorro's life throughout the 1960s and 1970s was a repetitive cycle of reunions with either her husband or children.

The executive and legislative branches became more interdependent, but power was shared. The National Assembly prepared the budget, but the president had to be consulted on taxation; Supreme Court vacancies had to be agreed on by both of the other branches of government;{{sfn|Staten|2010|p=132}} and although the president retained the power of veto, the legislature could overturn a veto by a simple majority vote.{{sfn|Bothmann|2015|p=174}} Though some of the changes also included reform of the Code of Criminal Procedures\u2014creating trial by jury, expanding the right of citizens to press charges, and evaluating police authority, among others{{sfn|Arnson|Holiday|1991|p=46}}\u2014failure of the government to investigate past abuses by the police and the military or institute judicial proceedings, granted tacit impunity for those who committed human rights abuses or violence. Though the 1990 Amnesty Law had curtailed some of administration's ability to prosecute,{{sfn|Arnson|Holiday|1991|p=56}} it also lacked the funds, impartial judiciary and possibly the will to seek transitional justice.  [[Sof\u00eda Montenegro]], editor of the Sandinistan paper ''Barricada'' and others have argued that Chamorro would have dealt with past abuse if she could have, but others, like Bishop Bernardo Hombach, are confident that her faith would have required her to forgive.

She was against abortion and questioned cohabitation, contraception and divorce. Cutbacks in public services during her regime, like child care and centers for rehabilitation, led to an increase in low-income women being forced into [[prostitution]] and crime.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=264}} According to a United Nations study, the financial insecurity forced women and adolescents into \"street professions\", elevating security risks and increasing the rate of drop outs, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and prostitution.<ref name=\"prostitution, delinquency, drug use\">{{cite web|last1=Committee on the Rights of the Child|title=Country analysis: Nicaragua: Nicaragua. 10/17/1994|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/4e6a2923d2c6d19f4125615100606318?Opendocument|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=6 September 2015|location=Geneva, Switzerland|date=21 October 1994}}</ref> In addition, austerity measures that eliminated free health care made it difficult for the poor to afford care. The Sandinista Workers Central ({{lang-es|Central Sandinista De Trabajadores}}, CST) stepped in to offer health care and child care to women who could not afford the new government plan.{{sfn|Staten|2010|p=135}} She did support women's rights to become property holders, and saw such ownership as a protection when divorce or widowhood deprived women of a husband's support. Her administration did not actively prepare or encourage women's participation in political life, nor did she appoint women to governmental positions.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=264}}\n\nThe economic policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment outside the home in Nicaragua steadily increased during the same time frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.{{sfn|Chavez Metoyer|2000|p=5}}\n\nThe 1992 Sexual Crime Code modifications resulted in winners and losers.
