The film stars [[Jane Withers]], [[O. P. Heggie]], [[Jackie Searl]], [[Katharine Alexander]], and [[Walter Woolf King]]. It was Wither's first starring role.\n \n==Plot==\nJeanette Tracy, known to her friends as Ginger, is an 8-year-old orphan living in a New York slum apartment with her \"Uncle Rex\", an aging Shakespearean actor. Their poor but happy existence is framed by lines from famous Shakespearean plays which they recite to each other; their favorite is the balcony scene from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. One day a probation officer comes to the apartment and threatens to take Ginger away if she doesn't stop skipping school and Uncle Rex remains unemployed. Uncle Rex says he has found a job at the casting office and Ginger assures the officer that she will be a model student from now on. It turns out that Uncle Rex's new job is as a sidewalk hawker for a movie theater, and he is arrested when he attacks the manager who insults his Shakespearean acting. Unable to pay the $30 fine, he is sent to jail for 30 days.\n\nGinger steals small metal pieces from stores to come up with money to pay the fine and is caught and brought before a judge. He suggests that the well-to-do Mrs. Parker, who is writing a book about child-raising called ''Are Children Human?'' take her into her own home. Mrs. Parker's son, Hamilton, is the product of her ideas: an effeminate, snobbish, harp-playing youth. The contrast between Hamilton and Ginger is stark, as Ginger is a tomboy, speaks slang, and lacks table manners. But Mr. Parker, who disapproves of his wife's child-raising ideas, takes a liking to Ginger and offers to bail out Uncle Rex. When he brings him home to pick up Ginger, Uncle Rex is so overwhelmed by the elegant house and the opportunities that wealth can afford for Ginger's future that he runs out on her. He is struck by a car and spends several months in a hospital with [[aphasia]]. \n\nAs the months pass, Ginger becomes more and more cultured while Hamilton becomes more streetwise. When they are taken out for a ride on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] day, Ginger spots her old gang and Hamilton gets into a fight with an older boy who has taken Ginger's dog. Hamilton wins the fight. Back home, Ginger overhears Mrs. Parker reading from her book to her ladies' club, describing how uncouth Ginger was when she came to her and asserting that Uncle Rex isn't her real uncle at all, but a friend of her deceased actor-parents. Ginger becomes inconsolable and runs away with Hamilton back to her slum apartment. There they find Uncle Rex, who has found his way home. The Parkers join them there, having made up with one another after Mrs. Parker agrees to be more \"human\" in her child-raising efforts.\n\n==Cast== \n*[[Jane Withers]] as Ginger\n*[[O. P.
