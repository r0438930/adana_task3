Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and [[sculpture]]. Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term \"stained glass\" to include domestic [[leadlight|lead light]] and ''[[objet d'art|objets d'art]]'' created from [[came glasswork|foil glasswork]] exemplified in the famous lamps of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].\n\nAs a material ''stained glass'' is glass that has been coloured by adding [[Salt (chemistry)|metallic salts]] during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into ''stained glass windows'' in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. [[Paint]]ed details and yellow [[stain]] are often used to enhance the design. The term ''stained glass'' is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.\n\nStained glass, as an [[art]] and a [[craft]], requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. In [[Western Europe]] they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as \"illuminated wall decorations\".\n\nThe design of a window may be abstract or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the [[Bible]], history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church \u2013 episodes from the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]]; within a parliament building \u2013 shields of the constituencies; within a college hall \u2013 figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home \u2013 flora, fauna, or landscape.\n\n==Glass production==\n{{Main|Architectural glass}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as [[potash]], [[Sodium carbonate|soda]], and [[lead]] can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as [[Lime (material)|lime]], are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stained Glass in Medieval Europe |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/glas/hd_glas.htm |website=Department of Medieval Art and The Cloisters |publisher=The Metropolitain Museum of Art |accessdate=June 13, 2019}}</ref> Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red. Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to [[flashed glass]].\n\n===Cylinder glass or Muff===\nUsing a blow-pipe, a \"gather\" (glob) of molten glass is taken from the pot heating in the furnace. The gather is formed to the correct shape and a bubble of air blown into it. Using metal tools, molds of wood that have been soaking in water, and gravity, the gather is manipulated to form a long, cylindrical shape. As it cools, it is reheated so that the manipulation can continue. During the process, the bottom of the cylinder is removed. Once brought to the desired size it is left to cool. One side of the cylinder is opened. It is put into another oven to quickly heat and flatten it, and then placed in an [[Annealing (glass)|annealer]] to cool at a controlled rate, making the material more stable. \"Hand-blown\" cylinder (also called muff glass) and crown glass were the types used in ancient stained-glass windows. Stained glass windows were normally in churches and chapels as well as many more well respected buildings.\n\n===Crown glass===\nThis hand-blown glass is created by blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then spinning it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a [[potter's wheel]]. The [[centrifugal force]] causes the molten bubble to open up and flatten. It can then be cut into small sheets. Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses. Concentric, curving waves are characteristic of the process. The center of each piece of glass, known as the \"bull's-eye\", is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker than the rest of the sheet. It also has the distinctive lump of glass left by the \"pontil\" rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out. This lumpy, refr\u01d0\u0135active quality m\u0136eans the\u00ee\u0126\u0125\u012a\u00cd\u012d\u0128\u012a\u01cf\u012b\u012b\u01cf\u012b\u0137\u0130\u01d0\u0130\u0137\u012d\u012c\u0130\u0135\u013c\u012d\u012a\u00ce\u0137\u0139\u013c\u012b\u0131\u012a bulls-eyes are less transparent, but they have still been used for windows, both domestic and ecclesiastical. Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale.\n\n===Rolled glass===\u015e\u0154\u0150\u0156\u0154\u0155\n[[Architectural glass#Rolled plate (figured) glass|Rolled glass]] (sometimes called \"table glass\") is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or [[graphite]] table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling can be done by hand or by machine. Glass can be \"double rolled\", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8\" or 3mm). The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called [[cathedral glass]], but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.\n\n===Flashed glass===\nArchitectural glass must be at least {{sfrac|1|8}} of an inch (3&nbsp;mm) thick to survive the push and pull of typical wind loads. However, in the creation of red glass, the colouring ingredients must be of a certain concentration, or the colour will not develop. This results in a colour so intense that at the thickness of {{sfrac|1|8}} inch (3&nbsp;mm), the red glass transmits little light and appears black. The method employed is to laminate a thin layer of red glass to a thicker body of glass that is clear or lightly tinted, forming \"[[flashed glass]]\".\n\nA lightly coloured molten gather is dipped into a pot of molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above. Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well. A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abraded]] to reveal the clear or tinted glass below. The method allows rich detailing and patterns to be achieved without needing to add more lead-lines, giving artists greater freedom in their designs. A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them. For instance, 16th-century heraldic windows relied heavily on a variety of flashed colours for their intricate crests and creatures. In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, [[hydrofluoric acid]] was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose.\n\n===Modern production of traditional glass===\nThere are a number of glass factories, notably in Germany, the United States, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce high-quality glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent). Modern stained-glass artists have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways. In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used. Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained glass windows, in particular [[Tiffany glass]] and [[Dalle de verre]].\n\n==Colours==\n\n===Transparent glass===\n\nOrdinary [[soda-lime glass]] appears colourless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a green tint which becomes evident in thick pieces or can be seen with the aid of scientific instruments. A number of additives are used to reduce the green tint, particularly if the glass is to be used for plain window glass, rather than stained glass windows. Additives that reduce the green tint include [[manganese dioxide]] which produces [[sodium permanganate]], and may result in a slightly mauve tint, characteristic of the glass in older houses in [[New England]]. [[Selenium]] has been used for the same purpose.<ref name=\"Illustrated Glass Dictionary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100205233650/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html Illustrated Glass Dictionary] www.glassonline.com. Retrieved 3 August 2006</ref>\n\n===Green glass===\n\nWhile very pale green is the typical colour of transparent glass, deeper greens can be achieved by the addition of [[Iron(II) oxide]] which results in a bluish-green glass. Together with [[chromium]] it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make [[wine bottle]]s.\nThe addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass.<ref>[http://www.speclab.com/elements/chromium.htm Chemical Fact Sheet \u2013 Chromium] www.speclab.com.

The colour is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of lead glass with tin added.\n* Pure metallic [[copper]] produces a very dark red, opaque glass. Glass created in this manner is generally \"flashed\" (laminated glass). It was used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and exploited for the decorative effects that could be achieved by sanding and engraving.\n*[[Selenium]] is an important agent to make pink and red glass.

A small design called a ''Vidimus'' (from Latin \"we have seen\") is prepared which can be shown to the patron. A scaled model [[maquette]] may also be provided. The designer must take into account the design, the structure of the window, the nature and size of the glass available and his or her own preferred technique.\n\nA traditional narrative window has panels which relate a story. A figurative window could have rows of saints or dignitaries. Scriptural texts or mottoes are sometimes included and perhaps the names of the patrons or the person to whose memory the window is dedicated. In a window of a traditional type, it is usually left to the discretion of the designer to fill the surrounding areas with borders, floral motifs and canopies.\n\nA full-sized cartoon is drawn for every \"light\" (opening) of the window. A small church window might typically have two lights, with some simple [[tracery]] lights above. A large window might have four or five lights. The east or west window of a large [[cathedral]] might have seven lights in three tiers, with elaborate tracery. In medieval times the cartoon was drawn directly on the surface of a whitewashed table, which was then used as a pattern for cutting, painting and assembling the window. The cartoon is then divided into a patchwork, providing a template for each small glass piece. The exact position of the lead which holds the glass in place is also noted, as it is part of the calculated visual effect.\n\n===Selecting and painting the glass===\n\nEach piece of glass is selected for the desired colour and cut to match a section of the template. An exact fit is ensured by \"grozing\" the edges with a tool which can nibble off small pieces.Details of faces, hair and hands can be painted onto the inner surface of the glass using a special glass paint which contains finely ground lead or copper filings, ground glass, gum arabic and a medium such as wine, vinegar or (traditionally) urine. The art of painting details became increasingly elaborate and reached its height in the early 20th century.\n\nFrom 1300 onwards, artists started using \"silver stain\" which was made with [[silver nitrate]]. It gave a yellow effect ranging from pale lemon to deep orange. It was usually painted onto the outside of a piece of glass, then fired to make it permanent. This yellow was particularly useful for enhancing borders, canopies and haloes, and turning blue glass into green glass. By about 1450, a stain known as \"Cousin's rose\" was used to enhance flesh tones.\n\nIn the 16th century, a range of glass stains were introduced, most of them coloured by ground glass particles. They were a form of enamel. Painting on glass with these stains was initially used for small heraldic designs and other details. By the 17th century a style of stained glass had evolved that was no longer dependent upon the skilful cutting of coloured glass into sections. Scenes were painted onto glass panels of square format, like tiles. The colours were then annealed to the glass before the pieces were assembled.\n\nA method used for embellishment and gilding is the decoration of one side of each of two pieces of thin glass, which are then placed back to back within the lead [[came]]. This allows for the use of techniques such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]] to produce an effect visible from both sides but not exposing the decorated surface to the atmosphere or mechanical damage.\n\n===Assembly and mounting===\n\nOnce the glass is cut and painted, the pieces are assembled by slotting them into H-sectioned lead cames. All the joints are then soldered together and the glass pieces are prevented from rattling and the window made weatherproof by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. In modern windows, copper foil is now sometimes used instead of lead. For further technical details, see [[Came glasswork]].\n\nTraditionally, when a window was inserted into the window space, iron rods were put across it at various points to support its weight. The window was tied to these rods with copper wire. Some very large early Gothic windows are divided into sections by heavy metal frames called ''ferramenta''. This method of support was also favoured for large, usually painted, windows of the Baroque period.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Technical details\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Heaton, Butler and Bayne01.png|Maquette by [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]], 19th-century English manufacturers\nFile:Pt-coimbra-sevelha3.jpg|Exterior of a window at [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|S\u00e9 Velha de Coimbra]], [[Portugal]], showing a modern steel armature\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral 012 window showing leading and support.JPG|[[Thomas Becket]] window from [[Canterbury]] showing the ''pot metal'' and painted glass, lead H-sectioned ''cames'', modern steel rods and copper wire attachments\nFile:Meaux Vitrail 1867 30808 3.jpg|Skilled glass cutting and leading in a 19th-century window at [[Meaux Cathedral]], [[France]]\nFile:SML-Stained-Glass-5.jpg|A small panel by [[G.

Both the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] excelled at the manufacture of small colored glass objects. [[Phoenicia]] was important in glass manufacture with its chief centres [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Antioch]]. The [[British Museum]] holds two of the finest Roman pieces, the [[Lycurgus Cup]], which is a murky mustard color but glows purple-red to transmitted light, and the [[Portland vase]] which is midnight blue, with a carved white overlay.\n\nIn early Christian churches of the 4th and 5th centuries, there are many remaining windows which are filled with ornate patterns of thinly-sliced [[alabaster]] set into wooden frames, giving a stained-glass like effect.\n\nEvidence of stained-glass windows in churches and monasteries in Britain can be found as early as the 7th century. The earliest known reference dates from 675 AD when [[Benedict Biscop]] imported workmen from France to glaze the windows of the monastery of St Peter which he was building at [[Monkwearmouth]]. Hundreds of pieces of coloured glass and lead, dating back to the late 7th century, have been discovered here and at [[Jarrow]].<ref>Discovering stained glass \u2013 John Harries, Carola Hicks, Edition: 3 \u2013 1996</ref>\n\nIn the Middle East, the glass industry of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at [[Raqqa]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] and the most important products being highly transparent colourless glass and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Alabastron Italy Louvre S2375.jpg|A [[perfume]] flask from 100 BC to 200 AD\nFile:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n5.jpg|The [[Portland Vase]], a rare example of Roman flashed glass\nFile:Orvieto083.jpg|An alabaster window in [[Orvieto Cathedral]], Italy\n</gallery>\n\n===In Southwest Asia===\nThe creation of stained glass in [[Southwest Asia]] began in ancient times. One of the region's earliest surviving formulations for the production of colored glass comes from the [[Assyria]]n city of [[Nineveh]], dating to the seventh century BC. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'', attributed to the 8th century [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|alchemist]] [[J\u0101bir ibn Hayy\u0101n]], discusses the production of colored glass in ancient Babylon and Egypt.

As [[Gothic architecture]] developed into a more ornate form, windows grew larger, affording greater illumination to the interiors, but were divided into sections by vertical shafts and tracery of stone. This elaboration of form reached its height of complexity in the Flamboyant style in Europe, and windows grew still larger with the development of the [[Perpendicular style]] in England.\n\nIntegrated with the lofty verticals of Gothic cathedrals and parish churches, glass designs became more daring. The circular form, or [[rose window]], developed in France from relatively simple windows with openings pierced through slabs of thin stone to wheel windows, as exemplified by the west front of Chartres Cathedral, and ultimately to designs of enormous complexity, the tracery being drafted from hundreds of different points, such as those at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris and the \"Bishop's Eye\" at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].\n\nWhile stained glass was widely manufactured, [[Chartres]] was the greatest centre of stained glass manufacture, producing glass of unrivalled quality.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Stained Glass}}</ref>\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Medieval glass in France\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitrail Chartres 210209 07.jpg|Detail of a 13th-century window from [[Chartres Cathedral]]\nFile:Musee-de-l-Oeuvre-Notre-Dame-Strasbourg-IMG 1465 crop.JPG|''Charlemagne'' from a Romanesque window in [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]\nFile:Poitiers, Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre -PM 34985 lighter.JPG|The [[Crucifixion]] window of [[Poitiers Cathedral]]\nFile:Vitrail Cath\u00e9drale d'Evreux 22 02 09 13.jpg|Late Gothic [[Tree of Jesse]] window from [[Evreux Cathedral]]\nFile:South rose window of Chartres Cathedral01.jpg|The South Transept windows from Chartres Cathedral\n</gallery>\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Medieval glass in Germany and Austria\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:King David in Augsburg Cathedral light.JPG|''King David'' from [[Augsburg]] Cathedral, early 12th century.

Each major ocular window contains a single picture drawn from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] or the [[Life of the Virgin|Life of the Virgin Mary]], surrounded by a wide floral border, with two smaller facade windows by Ghiberti showing the martyred deacons, [[St Stephen]] and [[St Lawrence]]. One of the cupola windows has since been lost, and that by Donatello has lost nearly all of its painted details.<ref name=Lee1>Lee, Seddon and Stephens, pp. 118\u2013121</ref>\n\nIn Europe, stained glass continued to be produced; the style evolved from the Gothic to the Classical, which is well represented in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, despite the rise of [[Protestantism]]. In France, much glass of this period was produced at the [[Limoges]] factory, and in Italy at [[Murano]], where stained glass and faceted [[lead crystal]] are often coupled together in the same window. The French Revolution brought about the neglect or destruction of many windows in France.\n\nAt the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England, large numbers of medieval and Renaissance windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the injunctions of [[Thomas Cromwell]] against \"abused images\" (the object of veneration) resulted in the loss of thousands of windows. Few remain undamaged; of these the windows in the private chapel at [[Hengrave Hall]] in Suffolk are among the finest. With the latter wave of destruction the traditional methods of working with stained glass died, and were not rediscovered in England until the early 19th century. See [[Stained glass \u2013 British glass, 1811\u20131918]] for more details.\n\nIn the Netherlands a rare scheme of glass has remained intact at [[Sint Janskerk|Grote Sint-Jan]] Church, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]. The windows, some of which are 18 metres (59&nbsp;feet) high, date from 1555 to the early 1600s; the earliest is the work of [[Dirck Crabeth]] and his brother [[Wouter Crabeth|Wouter]].

The architectural movement was led by [[Augustus Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]]. Many new churches were planted in large towns and many old churches were restored. This brought about a great demand for the revival of the art of stained glass window making.\n\nAmong the earliest 19th-century English manufacturers and designers were [[William Warrington]] and [[Hardman & Co.|John Hardman]] of Birmingham, whose nephew, John Hardman Powell, had a commercial eye and exhibited works at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, influencing stained glass in the United States of America. Other manufacturers included [[William Wailes]], [[Ward and Hughes]], [[Clayton and Bell]], [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]] and [[Charles Eamer Kempe]]. A Scottish designer, [[Daniel Cottier]], opened firms in Australia and the US.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:St Andrews window 08 6 west John and Paul.jpg|Detail, ''Apostles John and Paul'', [[Hardman of Birmingham]], 1861\u201367, typical of Hardman in its elegant arrangement of figures and purity of colour.

[[Peterborough Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Revival in France===\n{{see|List of French stained glass manufacturers}}\nIn France there was a greater continuity of stained glass production than in England. In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists. In 1824 the [[S\u00e8vres]] porcelain factory began producing stained glass to supply the increasing demand.\nIn France many churches and cathedrals suffered despoliation during the [[French Revolution]]. During the 19th century a great number of churches were restored by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. Many of France's finest ancient windows were restored at that time. From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval glass, both in the artwork and in the nature of the glass itself. The pioneers were Henri G\u00e8rente and Andr\u00e9 Lusson.<ref name= GC>Gordon Campbell, ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-518948-5}}</ref>\nOther glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by the brilliant cerulean colour of the blue backgrounds (as against the purple-blue of the glass of Chartres) and the use of pink and mauve glass.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitrail du 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cle Reims 020208 03.jpg|Detail of a \"Tree of Jesse\" window in [[Reims Cathedral]] designed in the 13th-century style by L.

There was a great demand for stained glass. The designs for many windows were based directly on the work of famous engravers such as [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. Original designs often imitate this style. Much 19th-century German glass has large sections of painted detail rather than outlines and details dependent on the lead. The Royal Bavarian Glass Painting Studio was founded by Ludwig I in 1827.<ref name=GC/>  A major firm was [[Mayer of Munich]], which commenced glass production in 1860, and is still operating as [http://www.mayer-of-munich.com/ ''Franz Mayer of Munich, Inc.'']. German stained glass found a market across Europe, in America and Australia. Stained glass studios were also founded in Italy and Belgium at this time.<ref name=GC/>\n\nIn the [[Austrian Empire]] and later [[Austria-Hungary]], one of the leading stained glass artists was Carl Geyling, who founded his studio in 1841. His son would continue the tradition as [[Carl Geyling's Erben]], which still exists today. Carl Geyling's Erben completed numerous stained glass windows for major churches in Vienna and elsewhere, and received an Imperial and [[Royal Warrant of Appointment]] from emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cathedral 2 by andy205.jpg|One of five windows donated to [[Cologne Cathedral]] by [[Ludwig II]]\nFile:Ghent Cathedral stained glass.jpg|[[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Ghent Cathedral]], Belgium\nFile:Stained glass in Saint Maurice churche, Olomouc.jpg|A window in the Late Gothic style, [[Church of Saint Maurice (Olomouc)|St Maurice's Church]], Olomouc, [[Czech Republic]], early 20th century\n</gallery>\n\n===Innovations in Britain and Europe===\nAmong the most innovative English designers were the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], [[William Morris]] (1834\u20131898) and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (1833\u20131898), whose work heralds the influential Arts & Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Peter Cormack, Arts & Crafts Stained Glass, Yale University Press, 2015</ref> The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts & Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.\n\n[[Art Nouveau]] or [[Belle Epoque]] stained glass design flourished in France, and Eastern Europe, where it can be identified by the use of curving, sinuous lines in the lead, and swirling motifs. In France it is seen in the work of [[Francis Chigot]] of Limoges. In Britain it appears in the refined and formal [[leadlight]] designs of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:David's Charge to Solomon, by Burne-Jones and Morris, Trinity Church, Boston, Massachusetts.JPG|''David's charge to Solomon'' shows the strongly linear design and use of flashed glass for which Burne-Jones' designs are famous.

Sanford Bray of Boston patented the use of copper foil in stained glass in 1886,https://patents.google.com/patent/US349424A/en However, a reaction against the aesthetics and technique of opalescent windows - led initially by architects such as Ralph Adams Cram - led to a rediscovery of traditional stained glass in the early 1900s. Charles J. Connick (1875-1945), who founded his Boston studio in 1913, was profoundly influenced by his study of medieval stained glass in Europe and by the Arts & Crafts philosophy of Englishman Christopher Whall. Connick created hundreds of windows throughout the US, including major glazing schemes at Princeton University Chapel (1927-9) and at Pittsburgh's Heinz Memorial Chapel (1937-8).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Other American artist-makers who espoused a medieval-inspired idiom included Nicola D'Ascenzo of Philadelphia, Wilbur Burnham and Reynolds, Francis & Rohnstock of Boston and Henry Wynd Young and J. Gordon Guthrie of New York.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Girl with Cherry Blossoms - Tiffany Glass & Decorating Company, c. 1890.JPG|Many of the distinctive types of glass invented by Tiffany are demonstrated within this single small panel including \"[[fracture-streamer glass]]\" and \"[[drapery glass]]\".\nFile:John LaFarge, Angel of Help (North Easton, MA).JPG|[[John La Farge]], ''The Angel of Help'', [[Easton, Massachusetts|North Easton, MA]] shows the use of tiny panes contrasting with large areas of  opalescent glass.

At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities. Examples include the [[The Glass House (Fulham)|Glass House]] in London set up by [[Mary Lowndes]] and [[Alfred Drury (stained glass artist)|Alfred J. Drury]] and [[An T\u00far Gloine]] in Dublin, which was run by [[Sarah Purser]] and included artists such as [[Harry Clarke]].\n\nA revival occurred in the middle of the century because of a desire to restore thousands of church windows throughout Europe destroyed as a result of World War II bombing. German artists led the way. Much work of the period is mundane and often was not made by its designers, but industrially produced.\n\nOther artists sought to transform an ancient art form into a contemporary one, sometimes using traditional techniques while exploiting the medium of glass in innovative ways and in combination with different materials. The use of slab glass, a technique known as [[Dalle de verre|Dalle de Verre]], where the glass is set in [[concrete]] or epoxy resin, was a 20th-century innovation credited to [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] and brought to the UK by [[Pierre Fourmaintraux]]. One of the most prolific glass artists using this technique was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Dominican Friar]] [[Dom Charles Norris]] OSB of [[Buckfast Abbey]].\n\n[[Gemmail]], a technique developed by the French artist Jean Crotti in 1936 and perfected in the 1950s, is a type of stained glass where adjacent pieces of glass are overlapped without using lead [[came]]s to join the pieces, allowing for greater diversity and subtlety of colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20030402061812/http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 April 2003 |title=Le grand dictionnaire Qu&#233bec government's online dictionary entry for '&#39;gemmail'&#39; (in French) |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=8 April 2003 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/228139/gemmail Gemmail], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref>\n[[Gemmail|Definition of Gemmail]]\nMany famous works by late 19th- and early 20th-century painters, notably [[Picasso]], have been reproduced in gemmail.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809295,00.html], Gemmail ''Time''</ref> A major exponent of this technique is the German artist [[Walter Womacka]].\n\nAmong the early well-known 20th-century artists who experimented with stained glass as an [[Abstract art]] form were [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painter [[Marc Chagall]] produced designs for many stained glass windows that are intensely coloured and crammed with symbolic details. Important 20th-century stained glass artists include [[John Hayward (stained glass maker)|John Hayward]], [[Douglas Strachan]], [[Ervin Bossanyi]], [[Louis Davis]], [[Wilhelmina Geddes]], [[Karl Parsons]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Patrick Reyntiens]], [[Johannes Schreiter]], [[Judith Schaechter]], [[Paul Woodroffe]], [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Bazaine]] at [[Saint-S\u00e9verin (Paris)|Saint S\u00e9verin]], [[Sergio de Castro (artist)|Sergio de Castro]] at Couvrechef- La Folie ([[Caen]]), [[Hamburg-Dulsberg]] and [[Romont]] (Switzerland), and the Loire Studio of [[Gabriel Loire]] at [[Chartres]]. The west windows of England's [[Manchester Cathedral]], by [[Tony Hollaway]], are some of the most notable examples of symbolic work.\n\nIn Germany, stained glass development continued with the inter-war work of [[Johan Thorn Prikker]] and [[Josef Albers]], and the postwar achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath. Trends included the abandonment of figurative designs and of painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads.<ref name=\"Harrod-p452\">Harrod, Tanya, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press (4 Feb 1999), {{ISBN|978-0300077803}}, p. 452</ref> The works of [[Ludwig Schaffrath]] demonstrate the late 20th-century trends in the use of stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass.  In the 1970s young British stained-glass artists such as [[Brian Clarke]] were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass.<ref name=\"Harrod-p452\" />\n\nIn the UK, the professional organisation for stained glass artists has been the British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921. Since 1924 the BSMGP has published an annual journal, The Journal of Stained Glass. It continues to be Britain's only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of stained glass. From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in stained glass painting and staining, to act as a locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the stained glass craft and to preserve the invaluable stained glass heritage of Britain. See www.bsmgp.org.uk for a range of stained glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent stained glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of stained glass. Back issues of The Journal of Stained Glass are listed and there is a searchable index for stained glass articles, an invaluable resource for stained glass researchers.\n\nAfter the First World War, stained glass window memorials were a popular choice among wealthier families, examples can be found in churches across the UK.\n\nIn the United States, there is a 100-year-old trade organization, The Stained Glass Association of America, whose purpose is to function as a publicly recognized organization to assure survival of the craft by offering guidelines, instruction and training to craftspersons. The SGAA also sees its role as defending and protecting its craft against regulations that might restrict its freedom as an architectural art form. The current president is Kathy Bernard. Today there are academic establishments that teach the traditional skills. One of these is Florida State University's Master Craftsman Program, which recently completed a {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}} high stained-glass windows, designed by Robert Bischoff, the program's director, and Jo Ann, his wife and installed to overlook [[Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium]].

Jewish communities in the United States saw this emergence in the mid-19th century, with such notable examples as the sanctuary depiction of the Ten Commandments in New York's Congregation Anshi Chesed.  From the mid-20th century to the present, stained glass windows have been a ubiquitous feature of American synagogue architecture.  Styles and themes for synagogue stained glass artwork are as diverse as their church counterparts.  As with churches, synagogue stained glass windows are often dedicated by member families in exchange for major financial contributions to the institution.\n\n===Places of worship===\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Sainte-Chapelle Choeur.JPG|The dazzling display of medieval glass at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\nFile:Stained Glass Window, Church of Our Lady, Koblenz - Germany..jpg|The chancel windows of the Church of Our Lady, [[Koblenz]], Germany\nFile:Nasir-al molk -1.jpg|Sunlight shining through stained glass onto coloured carpet of [[Nasir ol Molk Mosque]]\nFile:DSC04484 Istanbul - Sultan Ahmet camii (Moschea blu) - Foto G.

In their simplest form they typically depict birds and flowers in small panels, often surrounded with machine-made ''[[cathedral glass]]'' which, despite what the name suggests, is pale-coloured and textured. Some large homes have splendid examples of secular pictorial glass. Many small houses of the 19th and early 20th centuries have [[leadlight]] windows.\n\n* [[Prairie School|Prairie style]] homes\n* The houses of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Shaki khan palace 1.jpg|[[Shabaka (window)|Shabaka]] (stained glass) at the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Public and commercial buildings===\nStained glass has often been used as a decorative element in public buildings, initially in places of learning, government or justice but increasingly in other public and commercial places such as banks, retailers and railway stations.

Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and [[sculpture]]. Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term \"stained glass\" to include domestic [[leadlight|lead light]] and ''[[objet d'art|objets d'art]]'' created from [[came glasswork|foil glasswork]] exemplified in the famous lamps of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].\n\nAs a material ''stained glass'' is glass that has been coloured by adding [[Salt (chemistry)|metallic salts]] during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into ''stained glass windows'' in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. [[Paint]]ed details and yellow [[stain]] are often used to enhance the design. The term ''stained glass'' is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.\n\nStained glass, as an [[art]] and a [[craft]], requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. In [[Western Europe]] they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as \"illuminated wall decorations\".\n\nThe design of a window may be abstract or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the [[Bible]], history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church \u2013 episodes from the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]]; within a parliament building \u2013 shields of the constituencies; within a college hall \u2013 figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home \u2013 flora, fauna, or landscape.\n\n==Glass production==\n{{Main|Architectural glass}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as [[potash]], [[Sodium carbonate|soda]], and [[lead]] can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as [[Lime (material)|lime]], are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stained Glass in Medieval Europe |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/glas/hd_glas.htm |website=Department of Medieval Art and The Cloisters |publisher=The Metropolitain Museum of Art |accessdate=June 13, 2019}}</ref> Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red. Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to [[flashed glass]].\n\n===Cylinder glass or Muff===\nUsing a blow-pipe, a \"gather\" (glob) of molten glass is taken from the pot heating in the furnace. The gather is formed to the correct shape and a bubble of air blown into it. Using metal tools, molds of wood that have been soaking in water, and gravity, the gather is manipulated to form a long, cylindrical shape. As it cools, it is reheated so that the manipulation can continue. During the process, the bottom of the cylinder is removed. Once brought to the desired size it is left to cool. One side of the cylinder is opened. It is put into another oven to quickly heat and flatten it, and then placed in an [[Annealing (glass)|annealer]] to cool at a controlled rate, making the material more stable. \"Hand-blown\" cylinder (also called muff glass) and crown glass were the types used in ancient stained-glass windows. Stained glass windows were normally in churches and chapels as well as many more well respected buildings.\n\n===Crown glass===\nThis hand-blown glass is created by blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then spinning it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a [[potter's wheel]]. The [[centrifugal force]] causes the molten bubble to open up and flatten. It can then be cut into small sheets. Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses. Concentric, curving waves are characteristic of the process. The center of each piece of glass, known as the \"bull's-eye\", is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker than the rest of the sheet. It also has the distinctive lump of glass left by the \"pontil\" rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out. This lumpy, refractive quality means the bulls-eyes are less transparent, but they have still been used for windows, both domestic and ecclesiastical. Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale.\n\n===Rolled glass===\n[[Architectural glass#Rolled plate (figured) glass|Rolled glass]] (sometimes called \"table glass\") is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or [[graphite]] table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling can be done by hand or by machine. Glass can be \"double rolled\", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8\" or 3mm). The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called [[cathedral glass]], but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.\n\n===Flashed glass===\nArchitectural glass must be at least {{sfrac|1|8}} of an inch (3&nbsp;mm) thick to survive the push and pull of typical wind loads. However, in the creation of red glass, the colouring ingredients must be of a certain concentration, or the colour will not develop. This results in a colour so intense that at the thickness of {{sfrac|1|8}} inch (3&nbsp;mm), the red glass transmits little light and appears black. The method employed is to laminate a thin layer of red glass to a thicker body of glass that is clear or lightly tinted, forming \"[[flashed glass]]\".\n\nA lightly coloured molten gather is dipped into a pot of molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above. Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well. A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abraded]] to reveal the clear or tinted glass below. The method allows rich detailing and patterns to be achieved without needing to add more lead-lines, giving artists greater freedom in their designs. A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them. For instance, 16th-century heraldic windows relied heavily on a variety of flashed colours for their intricate crests and creatures. In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, [[hydrofluoric acid]] was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose.\n\n===Modern production of traditional glass===\nThere are a number of glass factories, notably in Germany, the United States, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce high-quality glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent). Modern stained-glass artists have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways. In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used. Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained glass windows, in particular [[Tiffany glass]] and [[Dalle de verre]].\n\n==Colours==\n\n===Transparent glass===\n\nOrdinary [[soda-lime glass]] appears colourless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a green tint which becomes evident in thick pieces or can be seen with the aid of scientific instruments. A number of additives are used to reduce the green tint, particularly if the glass is to be used for plain window glass, rather than stained glass windows. Additives that reduce the green tint include [[manganese dioxide]] which produces [[sodium permanganate]], and may result in a slightly mauve tint, characteristic of the glass in older houses in [[New England]]. [[Selenium]] has been used for the same purpose.<ref name=\"Illustrated Glass Dictionary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100205233650/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html Illustrated Glass Dictionary] www.glassonline.com.

Glass created in this manner is generally \"flashed\" (laminated glass). It was used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and exploited for the decorative effects that could be achieved by sanding and engraving.\n*[[Selenium]] is an important agent to make pink and red glass.

A small design called a ''Vidimus'' (from Latin \"we have seen\") is prepared which can be shown to the patron. A scaled model [[maquette]] may also be provided. The designer must take into account the design, the structure of the window, the nature and size of the glass available and his or her own preferred technique.\n\nA traditional narrative window has panels which relate a story. A figurative window could have rows of saints or dignitaries. Scriptural texts or mottoes are sometimes included and perhaps the names of the patrons or the person to whose memory the window is dedicated. In a window of a traditional type, it is usually left to the discretion of the designer to fill the surrounding areas with borders, floral motifs and canopies.\n\nA full-sized cartoon is drawn for every \"light\" (opening) of the window. A small church window might typically have two lights, with some simple [[tracery]] lights above. A large window might have four or five lights. The east or west window of a large [[cathedral]] might have seven lights in three tiers, with elaborate tracery. In medieval times the cartoon was drawn directly on the surface of a whitewashed table, which was then used as a pattern for cutting, painting and assembling the window. The cartoon is then divided into a patchwork, providing a template for each small glass piece. The exact position of the lead which holds the glass in place is also noted, as it is part of the calculated visual effect.\n\n===Selecting and painting the glass===\n\nEach piece of glass is selected for the desired colour and cut to match a section of the template. An exact fit is ensured by \"grozing\" the edges with a tool which can nibble off small pieces.Details of faces, hair and hands can be painted onto the inner surface of the glass using a special glass paint which contains finely ground lead or copper filings, ground glass, gum arabic and a medium such as wine, vinegar or (traditionally) urine. The art of painting details became increasingly elaborate and reached its height in the early 20th century.\n\nFrom 1300 onwards, artists started using \"silver stain\" which was made with [[silver nitrate]]. It gave a yellow effect ranging from pale lemon to deep orange. It was usually painted onto the outside of a piece of glass, then fired to make it permanent. This yellow was particularly useful for enhancing borders, canopies and haloes, and turning blue glass into green glass. By about 1450, a stain known as \"Cousin's rose\" was used to enhance flesh tones.\n\nIn the 16th century, a range of glass stains were introduced, most of them coloured by ground glass particles. They were a form of enamel. Painting on glass with these stains was initially used for small heraldic designs and other details. By the 17th century a style of stained glass had evolved that was no longer dependent upon the skilful cutting of coloured glass into sections. Scenes were painted onto glass panels of square format, like tiles. The colours were then annealed to the glass before the pieces were assembled.\n\nA method used for embellishment and gilding is the decoration of one side of each of two pieces of thin glass, which are then placed back to back within the lead [[came]]. This allows for the use of techniques such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]] to produce an effect visible from both sides but not exposing the decorated surface to the atmosphere or mechanical damage.\n\n===Assembly and mounting===\n\nOnce the glass is cut and painted, the pieces are assembled by slotting them into H-sectioned lead cames. All the joints are then soldered together and the glass pieces are prevented from rattling and the window made weatherproof by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. In modern windows, copper foil is now sometimes used instead of lead. For further technical details, see [[Came glasswork]].\n\nTraditionally, when a window was inserted into the window space, iron rods were put across it at various points to support its weight. The window was tied to these rods with copper wire. Some very large early Gothic windows are divided into sections by heavy metal frames called ''ferramenta''. This method of support was also favoured for large, usually painted, windows of the Baroque period.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Technical details\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Heaton, Butler and Bayne01.png|Maquette by [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]], 19th-century English manufacturers\nFile:Pt-coimbra-sevelha3.jpg|Exterior of a window at [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|S\u00e9 Velha de Coimbra]], [[Portugal]], showing a modern steel armature\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral 012 window showing leading and support.JPG|[[Thomas Becket]] window from [[Canterbury]] showing the ''pot metal'' and painted glass, lead H-sectioned ''cames'', modern steel rods and copper wire attachments\nFile:Meaux Vitrail 1867 30808 3.jpg|Skilled glass cutting and leading in a 19th-century window at [[Meaux Cathedral]], [[France]]\nFile:SML-Stained-Glass-5.jpg|A small panel by [[G.

Both the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] excelled at the manufacture of small colored glass objects. [[Phoenicia]] was important in glass manufacture with its chief centres [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Antioch]]. The [[British Museum]] holds two of the finest Roman pieces, the [[Lycurgus Cup]], which is a murky mustard color but glows purple-red to transmitted light, and the [[Portland vase]] which is midnight blue, with a carved white overlay.\n\nIn early Christian churches of the 4th and 5th centuries, there are many remaining windows which are filled with ornate patterns of thinly-sliced [[alabaster]] set into wooden frames, giving a stained-glass like effect.\n\nEvidence of stained-glass windows in churches and monasteries in Britain can be found as early as the 7th century. The earliest known reference dates from 675 AD when [[Benedict Biscop]] imported workmen from France to glaze the windows of the monastery of St Peter which he was building at [[Monkwearmouth]]. Hundreds of pieces of coloured glass and lead, dating back to the late 7th century, have been discovered here and at [[Jarrow]].<ref>Discovering stained glass \u2013 John Harries, Carola Hicks, Edition: 3 \u2013 1996</ref>\n\nIn the Middle East, the glass industry of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at [[Raqqa]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] and the most important products being highly transparent colourless glass and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Alabastron Italy Louvre S2375.jpg|A [[perfume]] flask from 100 BC to 200 AD\nFile:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n5.jpg|The [[Portland Vase]], a rare example of Roman flashed glass\nFile:Orvieto083.jpg|An alabaster window in [[Orvieto Cathedral]], Italy\n</gallery>\n\n===In Southwest Asia===\nThe creation of stained glass in [[Southwest Asia]] began in ancient times. One of the region's earliest surviving formulations for the production of colored glass comes from the [[Assyria]]n city of [[Nineveh]], dating to the seventh century BC. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'', attributed to the 8th century [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|alchemist]] [[J\u0101bir ibn Hayy\u0101n]], discusses the production of colored glass in ancient Babylon and Egypt. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'' also describes how to create colored glass and artificial gemstones made from high-quality stained glass.<ref>[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%209.htm The Manufacture of Coloured Glass] and [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%2093.html Assessment of ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna''], ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.</ref> The tradition of stained glass manufacture has continued, with mosques, palaces, and public spaces being decorated with stained glass throughout the Islamic world. The stained glass of Islam is generally non-pictorial and of purely geometric design, but may contain both floral motifs and text. \n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Nasirolmolk.jpg|Stained glass in the [[Nasir al-Mulk mosque]] in [[Shiraz]], Iran\nFile:Stained glass Photo From Sahand Ace..jpg|Stained glass in Dowlat Abad Garden at [[Yazd]], [[Iran]]\nFile:Stained glass window in a mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem (12393551704).jpg|From a mosque in [[Jerusalem]], this window contains highly detailed text.\n</gallery>\n\n===Medieval glass in Europe===\n{{see also|Poor Man's Bible|Medieval stained glass}}\n\nStained glass, as an art form, reached its height in the [[Middle Ages]] when it became a major pictorial form used to illustrate the narratives of the Bible to a largely illiterate populace.\n\nIn the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and Early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period, from about 950 to 1240, the untraceried windows demanded large expanses of glass which of necessity were supported by robust iron frames, such as may be seen at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. As [[Gothic architecture]] developed into a more ornate form, windows grew larger, affording greater illumination to the interiors, but were divided into sections by vertical shafts and tracery of stone. This elaboration of form reached its height of complexity in the Flamboyant style in Europe, and windows grew still larger with the development of the [[Perpendicular style]] in England.\n\nIntegrated with the lofty verticals of Gothic cathedrals and parish churches, glass designs became more daring. The circular form, or [[rose window]], developed in France from relatively simple windows with openings pierced through slabs of thin stone to wheel windows, as exemplified by the west front of Chartres Cathedral, and ultimately to designs of enormous complexity, the tracery being drafted from hundreds of different points, such as those at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris and the \"Bishop's Eye\" at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].\n\nWhile stained glass was widely manufactured, [[Chartres]] was the greatest centre of stained glass manufacture, producing glass of unrivalled quality.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Stained Glass}}</ref>\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Medieval glass in France\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitrail Chartres 210209 07.jpg|Detail of a 13th-century window from [[Chartres Cathedral]]\nFile:Musee-de-l-Oeuvre-Notre-Dame-Strasbourg-IMG 1465 crop.JPG|''Charlemagne'' from a Romanesque window in [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]\nFile:Poitiers, Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre -PM 34985 lighter.JPG|The [[Crucifixion]] window of [[Poitiers Cathedral]]\nFile:Vitrail Cath\u00e9drale d'Evreux 22 02 09 13.jpg|Late Gothic [[Tree of Jesse]] window from [[Evreux Cathedral]]\nFile:South rose window of Chartres Cathedral01.jpg|The South Transept windows from Chartres Cathedral\n</gallery>\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Medieval glass in Germany and Austria\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:King David in Augsburg Cathedral light.JPG|''King David'' from [[Augsburg]] Cathedral, early 12th century.

Each major ocular window contains a single picture drawn from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] or the [[Life of the Virgin|Life of the Virgin Mary]], surrounded by a wide floral border, with two smaller facade windows by Ghiberti showing the martyred deacons, [[St Stephen]] and [[St Lawrence]]. One of the cupola windows has since been lost, and that by Donatello has lost nearly all of its painted details.<ref name=Lee1>Lee, Seddon and Stephens, pp. 118\u2013121</ref>\n\nIn Europe, stained glass continued to be produced; the style evolved from the Gothic to the Classical, which is well represented in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, despite the rise of [[Protestantism]]. In France, much glass of this period was produced at the [[Limoges]] factory, and in Italy at [[Murano]], where stained glass and faceted [[lead crystal]] are often coupled together in the same window. The French Revolution brought about the neglect or destruction of many windows in France.\n\nAt the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England, large numbers of medieval and Renaissance windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the injunctions of [[Thomas Cromwell]] against \"abused images\" (the object of veneration) resulted in the loss of thousands of windows. Few remain undamaged; of these the windows in the private chapel at [[Hengrave Hall]] in Suffolk are among the finest. With the latter wave of destruction the traditional methods of working with stained glass died, and were not rediscovered in England until the early 19th century. See [[Stained glass \u2013 British glass, 1811\u20131918]] for more details.\n\nIn the Netherlands a rare scheme of glass has remained intact at [[Sint Janskerk|Grote Sint-Jan]] Church, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]. The windows, some of which are 18 metres (59&nbsp;feet) high, date from 1555 to the early 1600s; the earliest is the work of [[Dirck Crabeth]] and his brother [[Wouter Crabeth|Wouter]].

The architectural movement was led by [[Augustus Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]]. Many new churches were planted in large towns and many old churches were restored. This brought about a great demand for the revival of the art of stained glass window making.\n\nAmong the earliest 19th-century English manufacturers and designers were [[William Warrington]] and [[Hardman & Co.|John Hardman]] of Birmingham, whose nephew, John Hardman Powell, had a commercial eye and exhibited works at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, influencing stained glass in the United States of America. Other manufacturers included [[William Wailes]], [[Ward and Hughes]], [[Clayton and Bell]], [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]] and [[Charles Eamer Kempe]]. A Scottish designer, [[Daniel Cottier]], opened firms in Australia and the US.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:St Andrews window 08 6 west John and Paul.jpg|Detail, ''Apostles John and Paul'', [[Hardman of Birmingham]], 1861\u201367, typical of Hardman in its elegant arrangement of figures and purity of colour.

[[Peterborough Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Revival in France===\n{{see|List of French stained glass manufacturers}}\nIn France there was a greater continuity of stained glass production than in England. In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists. In 1824 the [[S\u00e8vres]] porcelain factory began producing stained glass to supply the increasing demand.\nIn France many churches and cathedrals suffered despoliation during the [[French Revolution]]. During the 19th century a great number of churches were restored by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. Many of France's finest ancient windows were restored at that time. From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval glass, both in the artwork and in the nature of the glass itself. The pioneers were Henri G\u00e8rente and Andr\u00e9 Lusson.<ref name= GC>Gordon Campbell, ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-518948-5}}</ref>\nOther glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by the brilliant cerulean colour of the blue backgrounds (as against the purple-blue of the glass of Chartres) and the use of pink and mauve glass.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Vitrail du 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cle Reims 020208 03.jpg|Detail of a \"Tree of Jesse\" window in [[Reims Cathedral]] designed in the 13th-century style by L.

There was a great demand for stained glass. The designs for many windows were based directly on the work of famous engravers such as [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. Original designs often imitate this style. Much 19th-century German glass has large sections of painted detail rather than outlines and details dependent on the lead. The Royal Bavarian Glass Painting Studio was founded by Ludwig I in 1827.<ref name=GC/>  A major firm was [[Mayer of Munich]], which commenced glass production in 1860, and is still operating as [http://www.mayer-of-munich.com/ ''Franz Mayer of Munich, Inc.'']. German stained glass found a market across Europe, in America and Australia. Stained glass studios were also founded in Italy and Belgium at this time.<ref name=GC/>\n\nIn the [[Austrian Empire]] and later [[Austria-Hungary]], one of the leading stained glass artists was Carl Geyling, who founded his studio in 1841. His son would continue the tradition as [[Carl Geyling's Erben]], which still exists today. Carl Geyling's Erben completed numerous stained glass windows for major churches in Vienna and elsewhere, and received an Imperial and [[Royal Warrant of Appointment]] from emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cathedral 2 by andy205.jpg|One of five windows donated to [[Cologne Cathedral]] by [[Ludwig II]]\nFile:Ghent Cathedral stained glass.jpg|[[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Ghent Cathedral]], Belgium\nFile:Stained glass in Saint Maurice churche, Olomouc.jpg|A window in the Late Gothic style, [[Church of Saint Maurice (Olomouc)|St Maurice's Church]], Olomouc, [[Czech Republic]], early 20th century\n</gallery>\n\n===Innovations in Britain and Europe===\nAmong the most innovative English designers were the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], [[William Morris]] (1834\u20131898) and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (1833\u20131898), whose work heralds the influential Arts & Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Peter Cormack, Arts & Crafts Stained Glass, Yale University Press, 2015</ref> The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts & Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.\n\n[[Art Nouveau]] or [[Belle Epoque]] stained glass design flourished in France, and Eastern Europe, where it can be identified by the use of curving, sinuous lines in the lead, and swirling motifs. In France it is seen in the work of [[Francis Chigot]] of Limoges. In Britain it appears in the refined and formal [[leadlight]] designs of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:David's Charge to Solomon, by Burne-Jones and Morris, Trinity Church, Boston, Massachusetts.JPG|''David's charge to Solomon'' shows the strongly linear design and use of flashed glass for which Burne-Jones' designs are famous.

Sanford Bray of Boston patented the use of copper foil in stained glass in 1886,https://patents.google.com/patent/US349424A/en However, a reaction against the aesthetics and technique of opalescent windows - led initially by architects such as Ralph Adams Cram - led to a rediscovery of traditional stained glass in the early 1900s. Charles J. Connick (1875-1945), who founded his Boston studio in 1913, was profoundly influenced by his study of medieval stained glass in Europe and by the Arts & Crafts philosophy of Englishman Christopher Whall. Connick created hundreds of windows throughout the US, including major glazing schemes at Princeton University Chapel (1927-9) and at Pittsburgh's Heinz Memorial Chapel (1937-8).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Other American artist-makers who espoused a medieval-inspired idiom included Nicola D'Ascenzo of Philadelphia, Wilbur Burnham and Reynolds, Francis & Rohnstock of Boston and Henry Wynd Young and J. Gordon Guthrie of New York.\n\n<gallery style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:1.35\" class=\"center\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Girl with Cherry Blossoms - Tiffany Glass & Decorating Company, c. 1890.JPG|Many of the distinctive types of glass invented by Tiffany are demonstrated within this single small panel including \"[[fracture-streamer glass]]\" and \"[[drapery glass]]\".\nFile:John LaFarge, Angel of Help (North Easton, MA).JPG|[[John La Farge]], ''The Angel of Help'', [[Easton, Massachusetts|North Easton, MA]] shows the use of tiny panes contrasting with large areas of  opalescent glass.

At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities. Examples include the [[The Glass House (Fulham)|Glass House]] in London set up by [[Mary Lowndes]] and [[Alfred Drury (stained glass artist)|Alfred J. Drury]] and [[An T\u00far Gloine]] in Dublin, which was run by [[Sarah Purser]] and included artists such as [[Harry Clarke]].\n\nA revival occurred in the middle of the century because of a desire to restore thousands of church windows throughout Europe destroyed as a result of World War II bombing. German artists led the way. Much work of the period is mundane and often was not made by its designers, but industrially produced.\n\nOther artists sought to transform an ancient art form into a contemporary one, sometimes using traditional techniques while exploiting the medium of glass in innovative ways and in combination with different materials. The use of slab glass, a technique known as [[Dalle de verre|Dalle de Verre]], where the glass is set in [[concrete]] or epoxy resin, was a 20th-century innovation credited to [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] and brought to the UK by [[Pierre Fourmaintraux]]. One of the most prolific glass artists using this technique was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Dominican Friar]] [[Dom Charles Norris]] OSB of [[Buckfast Abbey]].\n\n[[Gemmail]], a technique developed by the French artist Jean Crotti in 1936 and perfected in the 1950s, is a type of stained glass where adjacent pieces of glass are overlapped without using lead [[came]]s to join the pieces, allowing for greater diversity and subtlety of colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20030402061812/http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 April 2003 |title=Le grand dictionnaire Qu&#233bec government's online dictionary entry for '&#39;gemmail'&#39; (in French) |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=8 April 2003 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/228139/gemmail Gemmail], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref>\n[[Gemmail|Definition of Gemmail]]\nMany famous works by late 19th- and early 20th-century painters, notably [[Picasso]], have been reproduced in gemmail.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809295,00.html], Gemmail ''Time''</ref> A major exponent of this technique is the German artist [[Walter Womacka]].\n\nAmong the early well-known 20th-century artists who experimented with stained glass as an [[Abstract art]] form were [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painter [[Marc Chagall]] produced designs for many stained glass windows that are intensely coloured and crammed with symbolic details. Important 20th-century stained glass artists include [[John Hayward (stained glass maker)|John Hayward]], [[Douglas Strachan]], [[Ervin Bossanyi]], [[Louis Davis]], [[Wilhelmina Geddes]], [[Karl Parsons]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Patrick Reyntiens]], [[Johannes Schreiter]], [[Judith Schaechter]], [[Paul Woodroffe]], [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Bazaine]] at [[Saint-S\u00e9verin (Paris)|Saint S\u00e9verin]], [[Sergio de Castro (artist)|Sergio de Castro]] at Couvrechef- La Folie ([[Caen]]), [[Hamburg-Dulsberg]] and [[Romont]] (Switzerland), and the Loire Studio of [[Gabriel Loire]] at [[Chartres]]. The west windows of England's [[Manchester Cathedral]], by [[Tony Hollaway]], are some of the most notable examples of symbolic work.\n\nIn Germany, stained glass development continued with the inter-war work of [[Johan Thorn Prikker]] and [[Josef Albers]], and the postwar achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath. Trends included the abandonment of figurative designs and of painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads.<ref name=\"Harrod-p452\">Harrod, Tanya, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press (4 Feb 1999), {{ISBN|978-0300077803}}, p. 452</ref> The works of [[Ludwig Schaffrath]] demonstrate the late 20th-century trends in the use of stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass.  In the 1970s young British stained-glass artists such as [[Brian Clarke]] were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass.<ref name=\"Harrod-p452\" />\n\nIn the UK, the professional organisation for stained glass artists has been the British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921. Since 1924 the BSMGP has published an annual journal, The Journal of Stained Glass. It continues to be Britain's only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of stained glass. From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in stained glass painting and staining, to act as a locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the stained glass craft and to preserve the invaluable stained glass heritage of Britain. See www.bsmgp.org.uk for a range of stained glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent stained glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of stained glass. Back issues of The Journal of Stained Glass are listed and there is a searchable index for stained glass articles, an invaluable resource for stained glass researchers.\n\nAfter the First World War, stained glass window memorials were a popular choice among wealthier families, examples can be found in churches across the UK.\n\nIn the United States, there is a 100-year-old trade organization, The Stained Glass Association of America, whose purpose is to function as a publicly recognized organization to assure survival of the craft by offering guidelines, instruction and training to craftspersons. The SGAA also sees its role as defending and protecting its craft against regulations that might restrict its freedom as an architectural art form. The current president is Kathy Bernard. Today there are academic establishments that teach the traditional skills. One of these is Florida State University's Master Craftsman Program, which recently completed a {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}} high stained-glass windows, designed by Robert Bischoff, the program's director, and Jo Ann, his wife and installed to overlook [[Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium]].

Jewish communities in the United States saw this emergence in the mid-19th century, with such notable examples as the sanctuary depiction of the Ten Commandments in New York's Congregation Anshi Chesed.  From the mid-20th century to the present, stained glass windows have been a ubiquitous feature of American synagogue architecture.  Styles and themes for synagogue stained glass artwork are as diverse as their church counterparts.
