It is widely regarded as one of the construction industry's most authoritative publications. It is owned by BNP Media.\n\nThe magazine's subscribers include [[General contractor|contractor]]s, project owners, [[engineer]]s, [[architect]]s, public works officials and industry suppliers.\nIt covers the design and construction of [[high-rise]] buildings, [[stadium]]s, [[airport]]s, long-span [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[Power station|power plants]], industrial plants, water and [[wastewater]] projects, and [[toxic waste]] cleanup projects. It also covers the construction industry's financial, legal, regulatory, safety, environmental, management, corporate and labor issues.\n\n''ENR'' annually ranks the largest contractors and design firms in the U.S. and internationally.  Its \"construction economics\" section covers the cost fluctuations of a wide range of [[building material]]s.\n\n==History==\n''ENR'' traces its roots to two publications. The older magazine was first published as '''''The Engineer and Surveyor''''' in 1874. This publication was later renamed ''The Engineer, Architect and Surveyor'', then ''Engineering News and American Railway Journal'' and eventually '''''Engineering News'''''. The second publication was first known as '''''The Plumber and Sanitary Engineer'''''. It was later renamed ''The Sanitary Engineer'', then ''Engineering and Building Record'', and finally '''''Engineering Record'''''. In 1917, ''Engineering News'' and ''Engineering Record'' merged to become the magazine that is published today, ''Engineering News-Record'' with E.J. Mehren as its editor until 1924.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Schmitt|first= F.E.|date= January 5, 1939|title= To Our Readers|journal= Engineering News-Record|volume= 122|issue= 1|page= 10|publisher= McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc.|location= New York|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=48ojAAAAMAAJ|format= Google books|accessdate= 2008-12-28|quote= Engineering News-Record is a consolidation of Engineering News and Engineering Record, effected in 1917}}</ref>\n\nSince the merger of the two magazines into ''ENR'', the publication is recognized as the leading engineering and construction news magazine.

The Award of Excellence, originally called the Man of the Year award, has been issued annually since 1966.  Award of Excellence recipients include Robert Boyd, who brought engineering and managing excellence to [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]]'s $15-billion [[James Bay Project]], Fazlur Khan, avant-garde designer of tall buildings, and Vinton Bacon, whose fearless fight against graft in the [[Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago]] brought an attempt on his life.\n\n==''ENR''<nowiki/>'s economic data==\n''Engineering News-Record'', as a service to its readers, compiles and publishes an extensive amount of data on building material prices and construction labor costs.  Each month it publishes prices for 67 different building materials, in each of 20 major U.S. cities. The first weekly issue each month contains a table of cement, [[ready-mix concrete]], and aggregate (crushed stone) prices, the second weekly issue contains a table of pipe prices, the third issue contains lumber, plywood, drywall, and insulation prices, and the fourth issue contains steel and other metal product prices.\n\nA small amount of this data is then used to calculate two monthly index figures, the Construction Cost Index and the Building Cost Index.  Both indexes are calculated using a formula made up of fixed amounts of four components\u2014Portland cement, 2x4 lumber, structural steel (steel beams), and labor.  The only difference between the two indexes is in their labor component.  The labor component of the Construction Cost Index is common (unskilled) labor, while the labor component of the Building Cost Index is skilled labor.\n\nThe Construction Cost Index has been issued since 1908, while the Building Cost Index has been issued since 1915.  Each index is widely used throughout the U.S. construction industry as a benchmark for measuring inflation.\n\nThe ''ENR'' cost indexes were created by ''ENR''<nowiki/>'s director of market surveys, Elsie Eaves.\n\n==''ENR''<nowiki/>'s economic analysis==\n''Engineering News-Record'' publishes quarterly cost reports, which are eight to twelve page collections of articles analyzing the most critical factors impacting construction costs.  Topics may include lumber prices, personnel shortages, copper prices, fuel costs, and workers' compensation insurance. The December cost report is always devoted to international construction costs.\n\n== Top International Contractors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Company\n! Origin\n!

Award of Excellence recipients include Robert Boyd, who brought engineering and managing excellence to [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]]'s $15-billion [[James Bay Project]], Fazlur Khan, avant-garde designer of tall buildings, and Vinton Bacon, whose fearless fight against graft in the [[Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago]] brought an attempt on his life.\n\n==''ENR''<nowiki/>'s economic data==\n''Engineering News-Record'', as a service to its readers, compiles and publishes an extensive amount of data on building material prices and construction labor costs.  Each month it publishes prices for 67 different building materials, in each of 20 major U.S. cities. The first weekly issue each month contains a table of cement, [[ready-mix concrete]], and aggregate (crushed stone) prices, the second weekly issue contains a table of pipe prices, the third issue contains lumber, plywood, drywall, and insulation prices, and the fourth issue contains steel and other metal product prices.\n\nA small amount of this data is then used to calculate two monthly index figures, the Construction Cost Index and the Building Cost Index.  Both indexes are calculated using a formula made up of fixed amounts of four components\u2014Portland cement, 2x4 lumber, structural steel (steel beams), and labor.  The only difference between the two indexes is in their labor component.  The labor component of the Construction Cost Index is common (unskilled) labor, while the labor component of the Building Cost Index is skilled labor. \n\nThe Construction Cost Index has been issued since 1908, while the Building Cost Index has been issued since 1915.  Each index is widely used throughout the U.S. construction industry as a benchmark for measuring inflation. \n\nThe ''ENR'' cost indexes were created by ''ENR''<nowiki/>'s director of market surveys, Elsie Eaves.\n\n==''ENR''<nowiki/>'s economic analysis==\n''Engineering News-Record'' publishes quarterly cost reports, which are eight to twelve page collections of articles analyzing the most critical factors impacting construction costs.  Topics may include lumber prices, personnel shortages, copper prices, fuel costs, and workers' compensation insurance. The December cost report is always devoted to international construction costs.\n\n== Top International Contractors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Company\n! Origin\n!
