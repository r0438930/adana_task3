It was first broadcast on [[Adult Swim]] in the United States on December 18, 2005. In the episode, protagonist [[Huey Freeman]] seizes complete creative control of his elementary school's annual [[Christmas]] play, but runs into trouble with administration when he wishes to portray [[Jesus]] as [[dark skin|black]]. Meanwhile, [[Riley Freeman]] rekindles an old grudge he has against [[Santa Claus]].\n\n\"A Huey Freeman Christmas\" was directed by Seung Eun Kim and the script was written by series creator [[Aaron McGruder]].\n\n==Plot==\nHuey's culturally sensitive teacher, Mr. Uberwitz, offers him a chance to direct the school's Christmas play in the hope of seeing an African-American perspective on the holiday. Huey is skeptical at first, thinking that Uberwitz will get fired for making this offer, but accepts on the condition that Uberwitz sign an agreement giving him full creative control. He begins writing a new play that adheres to his unique vision, sets up an office to manage the organizational work, and hires [[Quincy Jones]] as music director.\n\nFinding that the students cast in the play are goofing off instead of rehearsing, Huey angrily fires all of them and consults with Jones about bringing in high-profile movie stars to fill the roles. He ignores protests from the Woodcrest [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] over the children's dismissal. When Huey refuses the school principal's demand that Jesus not be portrayed as black, the principal tears up Huey's agreement with Uberwitz. Demoralized and exhausted, Huey turns control over to Uberwitz, asking only to have his name removed from the production.\n\nUberwitz stages the play exactly as Huey wrote it, but only ten people show up to see the play. It is well-received by the local theater critics who attend, but almost no one else in Woodcrest is there to see it due to the PTA protests. Huey considers the play a success, but he regrets his decision to exclude his classmates and is disappointed that the public did not want to see his artistic vision. His vision was never made into a TV special nor a movie which Huey accepted out of arrogance. Uberwitz loses his job as Huey had predicted, but eventually becomes a college professor specializing in African-American studies.\n\nMeanwhile, Riley feuds with a shopping mall Santa, attacking him first with a folding chair and golf club and later with his airsoft guns. Riley is angry over not getting a set of wheel rims for Christmas in the past. [[Uncle Ruckus]] is hired by the mall to provide security for Santa, but proves inept at the job when Riley attacks again. Ruckus eventually becomes the new Santa, causing Jazmine to lose faith in the idea of Santa Claus until Ruckus claims that the real Santa had secretly chosen him to fill in after seeing how dangerous the mall could be. Jazmine accepts this story and attends Huey's play with Riley and Granddad, applauding enthusiastically as they sleep through it.\n\n==Reception==\nCurt Fields of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' deemed the episode \"excellent,\" writing, \"With a knowing spin on ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'', the story is a laugh-out-loud take on the holiday, consumerism and earnestly liberal white folks.\"<ref name=\"WP\">{{cite news|author=Curt Fields|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/27/AR2006072700562_pf.html|title='Boondocks': Uncensored And Unbelievably Funny|date=July 28, 2006|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{imdb episode|0530298}}\n* {{tv.com episode|the-boondocks/a-huey-freeman-christmas-594201/}}\n\n{{The Boondocks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Huey Freeman Christmas, A}}\n[[Category:The Boondocks (TV series) episodes]]\n[[Category:2006 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Christmas television episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title = A Huey Freeman Christmas\n| series = [[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]\n| image = \n| image_caption = \n| season = 1\n| episode = 7\n| airdate = {{Start date|2005|12|18}}\n| writer = [[Aaron McGruder]]\n| director = Seung Eun Kim\n| guests = [[Quincy Jones]] as himself<br>[[Judge Reinhold]] as Mr. Uberwitz \n| prev = The Story of Gangstalicious\n| next = The Real\n| season_article = The Boondocks (season 1)\n| episode_list = List of The Boondocks episodes\n}}\n\"'''A Huey Freeman Christmas'''\" is the seventh episode of the [[The Boondocks (season 1)|first season]] of the [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]''.
