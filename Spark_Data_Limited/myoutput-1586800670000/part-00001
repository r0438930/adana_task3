Freeport is known for hosting the second [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate of 1858]], and as \"Pretzel City, USA\", due to a popular local German bakery known for its pretzels in the 1850s. [[Freeport High School (Illinois)|Freeport High School]]'s mascot is the Pretzel to honor this unique heritage.\n\n==History==\nThe community was originally called '''Winneshiek'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA74|year=1908|page=74}}</ref> When it was incorporated, the new municipality took its name from the generosity of [[Tutty Baker]], who was credited with running a \"free port\" on the [[Pecatonica River]]. The name \"Winneshiek\" was later adopted, and is preserved to this day, by the Freeport Community Theatre Group.\n\nIn 1837, Stephenson County was formed and Freeport became its seat of government in 1838. Linked by a stagecoach with [[Chicago]], the community grew rapidly. In 1840, a frame courthouse was erected and the first school was founded. Within two years, Freeport had two newspapers and in 1853, the two were joined by a third which published in German. By then, the community had a population of 2,000.\n\nOn August 27, 1858, the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|second debate]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his [[U.S. Senate]] seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the \"[[Freeport Doctrine|Freeport Heresy]]\", and split the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Guelzom A. (2008). ''Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America'', page 162. Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-7320-6}}</ref> This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860.\n\nA monument to the debate was dedicated in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and stands at this site. A life size statue recreating the event was dedicated in 1992. Another renowned statue, ''Lincoln the Debator'' by [[Leonard Crunelle]], is a focal point in the city's Taylor Park. In many years there is also a reenactment of the debate, [[The Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1994 reenactments)|which has been shown]] on [[C-SPAN]].\n\nFreeport is known as the \"Pretzel City\", and its public high school's team is named the Pretzels.  The nickname is a reminder of Freeport's ethnic heritage; in the late 1850s, many [[German-American|Germans]], both from Pennsylvania and from their European homeland, resettled in Stephenson County bringing with them their love of pretzel snacks.<ref>http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930074752/http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884 |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref> In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-familie-eilders-is-samengesteld-door-b.-eilders/I96781.php|title=John Billerbeck (1835-1899) \u00bb Stamboom familie Eilders \u00bb Genealogie Online|author=B.

Freeport is known for hosting the second [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate of 1858]], and as \"Pretzel City, USA\", due to a popular local German bakery known for its pretzels in the 1850s. [[Freeport High School (Illinois)|Freeport High School]]'s mascot is the Pretzel to honor this unique heritage.\n\n==History==\nThe community was originally called '''Winneshiek'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA74|year=1908|page=74}}</ref> When it was incorporated, the new municipality took its name from the generosity of [[Tutty Baker]], who was credited with running a \"free port\" on the [[Pecatonica River]]. The name \"Winneshiek\" was later adopted, and is preserved to this day, by the Freeport Community Theatre Group.\n\nIn 1837, Stephenson County was formed and Freeport became its seat of government in 1838. Linked by a stagecoach with [[Chicago]], the community grew rapidly. In 1840, a frame courthouse was erected and the first school was founded. Within two years, Freeport had two newspapers and in 1853, the two were joined by a third which published in German. By then, the community had a population of 2,000.\n\nOn August 27, 1858, the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|second debate]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his [[U.S. Senate]] seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the \"[[Freeport Doctrine|Freeport Heresy]]\", and split the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Guelzom A. (2008). ''Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America'', page 162. Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-7320-6}}</ref> This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860.\n\nA monument to the debate was dedicated in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and stands at this site. A life size statue recreating the event was dedicated in 1992. Another renowned statue, ''Lincoln the Debator'' by [[Leonard Crunelle]], is a focal point in the city's Taylor Park. In many years there is also a reenactment of the debate, [[The Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1994 reenactments)|which has been shown]] on [[C-SPAN]].\n\nFreeport is known as the \"Pretzel City\", and its public high school's team is named the Pretzels.  The nickname is a reminder of Freeport's ethnic heritage; in the late 1850s, many [[German-American|Germans]], both from Pennsylvania and from their European homeland, resettled in Stephenson County bringing with them their love of pretzel snacks.<ref>http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930074752/http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884 |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref> In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-familie-eilders-is-samengesteld-door-b.-eilders/I96781.php|title=John Billerbeck (1835-1899) \u00bb Stamboom familie Eilders \u00bb Genealogie Online|author=B.
