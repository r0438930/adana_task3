He [[news presenter|anchored]] a nightly newscast and occasionally ventured to far-flung locations to report on national and international stories, taking with him his own [[Bell and Howell]] movie camera with which he shot his own news footage. With him on KNXT's newscasts in that time were three other Los Angeles television stalwarts, anchor and reporter [[Bill Stout]], weather forecaster [[Bill Keene]] and sports reporter [[Gil Stratton]] (who at the time also doubled as a radio, television and movie actor).\n\n===KTLA Channel 5===\nRoberts left KNXT in 1959 and joined Los Angeles station [[KTLA]] Channel 5 as news director and primary anchor, along with news producer/director Julian Macdonald, virtually remaking that independent station's news operation. The newscast Roberts and Macdonald oversaw included such respected figures as Stout (who followed Roberts to KTLA in 1960), sports reporter and former football star [[Tom Harmon]], and veteran reporter [[Stan Chambers]] (who retired on August 11, 2010 on his 87th birthday, marking 63 years as a reporter at KTLA). Roberts' signature conclusion to the early news broadcast was \"I bid you a pleasant evening\"; for the late news it was \"I bid you goodnight.\"\n\n===\"The Big News\"===\nIn 1966, Roberts returned to KNXT, joining the station's highly esteemed 6 p.m. \"The Big News\" broadcast and its late-night companion \"The Eleven O'Clock Report.\" Roberts joined a staff that included anchor [[Jerry Dunphy]], [[Maury Green]], [[Ralph Story]], Keene, and Stratton. Roberts contributed news and feature reports and anchored the weekend newscasts. Early in 1974 he once again left KNXT for KTLA and took over the station's hour-long 10 p.m. newscasts. After two years Roberts decided to step back from nightly television news and left KTLA; after a hiatus he joined then-[[PBS]] member television station [[KCET]], contributing feature reports and commentaries. His long tenure in Los Angeles comprised reports and travels ranging from offbeat local stories to the war in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. According to the book Helter Skelter, the young son of a neighbor of Roberts found what turned out to be the .22 Buntline revolver wielded by Manson Family member Tex Watson the night of actress Sharon Tate's and her houseguests' murders, and it was turned over to the police.  As details of the crime came out in the weeks that followed, the boy's father made several calls to the police, suggesting that the missing murder weapon was the same broken, long-barreled gun his son had found. Finally, fed up with months of being ignored by the LAPD, he asked Clete Roberts to intervene in December 1969. The book does not say whether the call from Roberts finally did the trick.\n\n===Acting career===\nRoberts also carried his polish and expertise onto the \"silver screen\" and television as well, most notably in select episodes of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', in which he played himself, a war correspondent.\n\nRoberts appeared as himself in the lengthy introduction to the crime syndicate expose film ''[[The Phenix City Story]]'' in 1955. He interviewed on camera several of the actual townspeople of [[Phenix City, Alabama]], who had been witness to the events there in the 1930s, '40s and early '50s.\n\nRoberts portrayed reporters in various productions, among them, ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]''  from 1979, the 1983 NBC miniseries ''[[V (1983 miniseries)|V]]'', as well a San Francisco television newsman in the 1983 nuclear war film ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''.\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nThe [[Associated Press Television and Radio Association]] of [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[Hawaii]] has established a $1,500 scholarship in Roberts' memory.{{cn|date=September 2015}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* {{IMDb name|0730950}}\n* {{Find a Grave|1365}}\n\n{{Vietnam War correspondents}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roberts, Clete}}\n[[Category:1912 births]]\n[[Category:1984 deaths]]\n[[Category:American radio reporters and correspondents]]\n[[Category:American television reporters and correspondents]]\n[[Category:American war correspondents]]\n[[Category:American war correspondents of the Vietnam War]]\n[[Category:American male journalists]]\n[[Category:Journalists from California]]\n[[Category:Journalists from Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Television anchors from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:20th-century American journalists]]\n[[Category:Burials at Valley Oaks Memorial Park]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name        = Clete Roberts\n| image       = Alan Alda Clete Roberts MASH 1976.JPG\n| caption     = From TV series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'':<br>Clete Roberts and [[Alan Alda]] (1976)\n| birthname   = \n| birth_date  = {{birth date|1912|2|1}}\n| birth_place = [[Portland, Oregon]]\n| death_date  = {{death date and age|1984|9|30|1912|2|1}}\n| death_place = [[Los Angeles, California]]\n| education   = \n| occupation  = [[Journalist]]<br />[[News presenter|Anchor]]\n| years_active = 1950s &ndash; 1980s\n| spouse      = \n| children    = \n| credits     = [[KCBS-TV]], [[KTLA]] Channel 5, [[KCET]]\n}}\n'''Clete Roberts''' (1 February 1912 \u2013 30 November 1984) was an [[Americans|America]]n [[broadcast journalism|broadcast journalist]] and film and television actor.\n\n==Career==\n\n===KNXT Channel 2===\nAfter serving as a [[war correspondent]] in [[World War II]] and [[Korean War|Korea]], Roberts settled in the Los Angeles area and became a respected radio news [[reporter]], eventually turning to television in the mid-1950s at KNXT Channel 2 (now [[KCBS-TV]]), the local CBS [[Owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] station.
