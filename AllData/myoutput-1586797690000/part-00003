Artists trained in the tradition of the [[Mughal miniature]] were dispersed from the imperial Mughal court, and developed styles also drawing from local traditions of painting, especially those illustrating the Hindu religious epics, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]''.  Each Rajputana kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|Miniatures]] in manuscripts or single sheets to be kept in albums were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but many paintings were done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelis, particularly, the havelis of [[Shekhawati]], the forts and palaces built by [[Shekhawat]] Rajputs.\n\nSubjects varied, but portraits of the ruling family, often engaged in hunting or their daily activities, were generally popular, as were narrative scenes from the epics or [[Hindu mythology]], as well as some [[genre painting|genre scenes]] of unnamed people.\n \nThe colours were extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones.  Gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colours was a lengthy process, sometimes taking 2 weeks. Brushes used were very fine.\n\n== Content ==\nWhile there exist a plethora of themes in Rajput paintings, a common motif found throughout Rajput works is the purposeful manipulation of space. In particular, the inclusion of fuller spaces is meant to emphasize the lack of boundaries and inseparability of characters and landscapes. In this way, the individuality of physical characters is almost rejected, allowing both the depicted backgrounds and human figures to be equally expressive.\n\nOutside of a purely artistic standpoint, Rajput paintings were often politically charged and commented on social values of the time. Mewar's rulers wanted these painting to portray their ambitions and establish their legacy. Therefore, paintings were often indicative of a ruler's legacy or their changes made to better society.\n\nBoth of these factors clearly distinguish Rajput paintings from Mughal works. While, from a chronological standpoint, both of these cultures clashed with one another, Rajput paintings only superficially adopted Mughal fashion and cultural standards.
