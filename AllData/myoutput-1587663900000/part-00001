The family subsequently returned to Salford, where Nash grew up. In the early 1960s he co-founded the Hollies, one of the UK's most successful [[pop music|pop]] groups, with school friend [[Allan Clarke (singer)|Allan Clarke]], and was credited as the group's leader on their first album. He was featured vocally on \"[[Just One Look (song)|Just One Loo]]<nowiki/>k\" (1964) and sang his first lead vocal on the original Hollies song \"To You My Love\" on the band's second album ''In The Hollies Style'' of the same year. He often sang featured bridge vocals on later Hollies recordings (\"So Lonely\", \"I've Been Wrong\", \"Pay You Back With Interest\") and provided lead vocals on several later singles, notably \"[[On a Carousel]]\"  and \"[[Carrie Anne]]\" (both 1967).<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Prolific songwriter Graham Nash still finds his voice with a new generation of fans |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/prolific-songwriter-graham-nash-still-finds-his-voice-with-a-new-generation-of-fans/news-story/10aa471da2073b4185c46108b5d4fdc1 |quote= |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=1 February 2017 }}</ref>\n\nNash encouraged the Hollies to write their own songs, initially with Clarke, then with Clarke and guitarist Tony Hicks. From 1964 to mid-1966 they wrote under the alias L. Ransford. Their own names were credited on songs from \"Stop Stop Stop\" from October 1966 onward.\n\nIn 1965, Nash, with Allan Clarke and guitarist Tony Hicks, formed Gralto Music Ltd, a publishing company which handled their own songs and later signed the young Reg Dwight (a.k.a. '[[Elton John]]' \u2013 who played piano and organ on Hollies 1969 and 1970 recordings).\n\n===Songwriting, activism, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY), Crosby & Nash, and solo career ===\n[[File:Graham Nash 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Nash performing in 2011]]\nNash was pivotal in the forging of a sound and lyrics, often writing the verses on Clarke, Hicks & Nash songs. However, Nash also composed songs by himself under the 'team banner' (like [[Lennon & McCartney]]), for example, 'Fifi the Flea' (1966), 'Clown' (1966), 'Stop Right There', 'Everything is Sunshine' (1967). The ''[[Butterfly (The Hollies album)|Butterfly]]'' album included several of his songs that had less group participation and exhibited more of a singer-songwriter approach. He was disappointed when this new style did not register with their audience, especially \"[[King Midas in Reverse]]\" (Nash and producer Ron Richards clashed over this song because Richards believed it was 'too complex' to work as a hit single).\n\nNash initially met both [[David Crosby]] and [[Stephen Stills]] in 1966 during a Hollies US tour. On a subsequent visit to the US in 1968, he was more formally introduced to Crosby by mutual friend [[Cass Elliott]] in [[Laurel Canyon]], Los Angeles. Nash left the Hollies to form a new group with Crosby and Stills. A trio at first, [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] later became a quartet with [[Neil Young]]: Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY).\n\nWith both configurations, Nash went on to even greater worldwide success, penning many of CSN's most-commercial hit singles such as \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" (about the house in Laurel Canyon shared with his then-lover [[Joni Mitchell]]); \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" (both of which had been rejected by the Hollies); \"[[Just a Song Before I Go]]\"; and \"[[Wasted on the Way]]\". Nash, nicknamed \"Willy\" by his band mates, has been described as the glue that keeps their often fragile alliances together.\n\nNash became politically active after moving to California, as reflected in his [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] songs \"Military Madness\" and \"[[Chicago (Graham Nash song)|Chicago / We Can Change the World]]\" (about the [[Chicago Seven|trial of the Chicago Eight]]).\n\nIn 1972, during CSNY's first hiatus, Nash teamed with Crosby, forming a successful duo. They have worked in this configuration on and off ever since, producing four studio albums and a few live and compilation albums. His song \"[[Immigration Man]]\", [[Crosby & Nash]]'s biggest hit as a duo, arose from a tiff he had with a US Customs official while trying to enter the country.\n\nIn 1979, Nash co-founded [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] which is against the expansion of [[nuclear power]]. MUSE put on the educational fundraising No Nukes events. In 2007 the group recorded a music video of a new version of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] song \"[[For What It's Worth (Stephen Stills song)|For What It's Worth]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nukefree.org/node/96 |title=\"For What It's Worth,\" No Nukes Reunite After Thirty Years |publisher=Nukefree.org |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nirs.org/home.htm |title=Musicians Act to Stop New Atomic Reactors |publisher=Nirs.org |accessdate=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609064533/http://www.nirs.org/home.htm |archivedate=9 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nNash briefly rejoined the Hollies in 1983 (to mark their 20th anniversary) to record two albums, ''What Goes Around'' and ''Reunion''. In 1993, Nash again reunited with the Hollies to record a new version of \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" that featured lead vocal by Buddy Holly (taken from an alternate version of the song given to Nash by Holly's widow Maria Eleana Holly)\u2014this Buddy Holly & the Hollies recording opened the ''Not Fade Away'' tribute album to Holly by various artists.\n\n[[File:David Crosby Graham Nash Occupy Wall Street 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|[[David Crosby]] and Nash playing [[Occupy Wall Street]], November 2011]]\nIn 2005, Nash collaborated with [[Norway|Norwegian]] musicians [[A-ha]] on the songs \"Over the Treetops\" (penned by [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy]]) and \"Cosy Prisons\" (penned by [[Magne Furuholmen]]) for the ''[[Analogue (album)|Analogue]]'' recording. In 2006, Nash worked with [[David Gilmour]] and David Crosby on the title track of David Gilmour's third solo album, ''[[On an Island]]''. In March 2006, the album was released and quickly reached No. 1 on the UK charts. Nash and Crosby subsequently toured the UK with Gilmour, singing backup on \"On an Island\", \"The Blue\", \"[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]\", and \"[[Find the Cost of Freedom]]\".\n\n[[File:DIG13603-011.jpg|thumb|left|Nash playing at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014]]\nIn addition to his political songs Nash has written many songs on other themes he cares about such as of nature and ecology\u2014beginning with the Hollies' \"Signs That Will Never Change\" (first recorded by [[the Everly Brothers]] in 1966)\u2014later CSNY's \"Clear Blue Skies\", plus [[anti-nuclear]]-waste-dumping (\"Barrel of Pain\"), anti-war (\"Soldiers of Peace\") and social issues (\"Prison Song\").\n\nNash appeared on the season 7 finale of ''[[American Idol]]'' singing \"Teach Your Children\" with [[Brooke White]].\n\nIn 2010, Nash was inducted a second time to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], this time as a member of the Hollies. He received an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] \"for services to music and charitable activities\", becoming an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Diplomatic and Overseas Division of the Queen's Birthday Honours List on 12 June 2010. Nash received the title of George Eastman Honorary Scholar at the [[George Eastman House]] on 22 January 2011, in Rochester, New York.<ref name=\"Rockhall.com\"/><ref name=\"http\"/>\n\nNash contributed a cover of \"[[Raining in My Heart]]\" to the 2011 tribute album ''[[Rave on Buddy Holly]]''.\n\nOn 22 January 2016, Nash announced the forthcoming release on 15 April 2016 of his new studio album entitled ''[[This Path Tonight (album)|This Path Tonight]]'' (his first collection of new songs in fourteen years) and shared the title track from it through ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]]'' magazine's website.<ref name=\"mojo4music.com Graham Nash This Path Tonight\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mojo4music.com/22974/graham-nash-previews-new-album-this-path-tonight/ |title= Graham Nash Previews New Album, This Path Tonight (Graham Nash shares the title track of his forthcoming album, This Path Tonight, in an exclusive stream for MOJO readers.)

Having acquired more than a thousand prints by 1976, Nash hired [[Graham Howe]] as his photography curator. In 1978 through 1984 a touring exhibition of selections from the Graham Nash Collection toured to more than a dozen museums worldwide. Nash decided to sell his 2,000 print collection through [[Sotheby's]] auction house in 1990 where it set an auction record for the highest grossing sale of a single private collection of photography.<ref>Beth Gates-Warren, editor, ''Photographs from the Collection of Graham Nash'', Sotheby's, New York, 25 April 1990</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://auctioncatalogs.com/product/sothebys-new-york-april-25-1990-photographs-from-the-collection-of-graham-nash-5443/ | title=Sotheby's New York, April 25, 1990: Photographs from the Collection of Graham Nash | work=Auction Catalogs | accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref> Nash said that some of the auction profit would be given to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] for the acquisition of contemporary photographs.<ref name=\"Photo auction\">{{cite web | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-04-26-mn-351-story.html | title=Graham Nash Photographs Sale Sets Record : Art: More than 400 pictures and albums sell for $2.4 million.

Mac Holbert who at that time was the tour manager for Crosby, Stills and Nash as well as handling computer/technical matters for the band. Nash ran into the problem common with all personal computers running [[graphics software]] during that period: he could create very sophisticated detailed images on the computer, but there was no output device ([[Printer (computing)|computer printer]]) capable of reproducing what he saw on the computer screen. Nash and Holbert initially experimented with early commercial printers that were then becoming available and printed many images on the large format Fujix inkjet printers at UCLA's JetGraphix digital output centre. When Fuji decided to stop supporting the printers, John Bilotta, who was running JetGraphix, recommended that Nash and Holbert look into the [[Iris printer]], a new large format continuous-tone [[inkjet printer]] built for [[prepress proofing]] by IRIS Graphics, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0105/nash_intro.htm |title=Nash Editions: Fine Art Printing on the Digital Frontier, by Garrett White |publisher=Digitaljournalist.org |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> Through IRIS Graphics national sales rep Steve Boulter, Nash also met programmer [[David Coons]], a colour engineer for Disney, who was already using the IRIS printer there to print images from Disney's new digital animation system.\n\nCoons worked off hours at Disney to produce large images of 16 of Nash's photographic portraits on [[Arches paper|arches watercolour paper]] using Disney's in-house model 3024 IRIS printer for a 24 April 1990 show at Simon Lowinsky gallery.<ref name=\"stansherer.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stansherer.com/Iris_2.htm |title=Digital Fine-Art Printing Comes of Age (Adapted from Chapter 1 of Harald Johnson's book, Mastering Digital Printing, Second Edition, Thomson Course Technology PTR, 2005, ISBN 1-59200-431-8.) |publisher=stansherer.com |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> Since most of the original negatives and prints had been lost in shipment to a book publisher, Coons had to scan [[contact sheet]]s and enhance the images so they could be printed in large format. He used software he had written to output the photographic images to the IRIS printer, a machine designed to work with proprietary prepress computer systems.<ref>Harald Johnson, \"Mastering Digital Printing\", Thompson Course Technology, 2002, {{ISBN|1-929685-65-3}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1990 Graham Nash purchased an IRIS Graphics 3047 inkjet printer for $126,000 and set it up in a small carriage house in [[Manhattan Beach, California]] near Los Angeles. David Coons and Steve Boulter used it to print an even larger November 1990 show of Nash's work for Parco Stores in Tokyo. The show entitled ''Sunlight on Silver'' was a series of 35 celebrity portraits by Nash which were 3 feet by 4 feet in an edition of 50 prints per image, a total of 1,750 images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0105/nash_intro.htm |title=Nash Editions: Fine Art Printing on the Digital Frontier, by Garrett White |publisher=digitaljournalist.org |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref><ref>Masayoshi Yamada, ''Graham Nash Photographs: Sunlight on Silver'', Parco Co.

Holbert retired as road manager for Crosby, Stills and Nash so that he could run the company. It opened its doors on 1 July 1991 with the name of Nash Editions Ltd.<ref name=\"stansherer.com\"/> Early employees included David Coons, John Bilotta and a [[Screen-printing|serigraphic]] print maker named Jack Duganne. They worked to further adapt the IRIS printer to fine art printing, experimenting with ink sets to try to overcome the fast-fading nature of IRIS prints, and even going as far as sawing off part of the print heads so they could be moved back to clear thicker printing paper stocks (voiding the $126,000 machine's warranty).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.photography.org/interviews/holbert.php |title=The Center for Photographic Art, Interview, Mac Holbert, September 2004 |publisher=photography.org |accessdate=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008001336/http://www.photography.org/interviews/holbert.php |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nash and Holbert decided to call their fine art prints \"''digigraphs''\" although Jack Duganne coined the name \"''[[Gicl\u00e9e]]''\" for these type of prints.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dq3Xj8zEYMIC&pg=PA11&dq=giclee+prints+produced+on+epson#PPA11,M1 |title='&#39;'Mastering Digital Printing'&#39;' By Harald Johnson, Page 11 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> The company is still in operation and currently uses Epson-based large format printers.\n\nIn 2005, Nash donated the original IRIS Graphics 3047 printer and Nash Editions ephemera to the [[National Museum of American History]], a [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\n==Personal life==\nNash was married to his first wife, Rose Eccles from 1964 until 1966. As an [[in-joke]], her surname inspired \"[[Jennifer Eccles]]\", a 1968 single by The Hollies; and also a jocular verse about Jennifer Eccles in \"[[Lily the Pink (song)|Lily the Pink]]\", a 1968 single by [[The Scaffold]] on which Nash sang [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]].

William Nash''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 2 February 1942) is a British-American [[singer-songwriter]] and musician. Nash is known for his light tenor voice and for his songwriting contributions as a member of the English pop/rock group [[the Hollies]] and the [[Folk rock|folk-rock]] supergroup [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]. Nash became an American citizen on 14 August 1978 and holds dual citizenship of the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nNash is a photography collector and a published photographer. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Crosby, Stills & Nash in 1997 and as a member of the Hollies in 2010.<ref name=\"Rockhall.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/inductee-list/ |title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |accessdate=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117041746/http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/inductee-list/ |archivedate=17 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"http\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/induction2010/#TheHollies |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: Inductees |publisher=Rockhall.com |accessdate=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223194626/http://www.rockhall.com/induction2010/ |archivedate=23 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nNash was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours List for services to music and to charity.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59446 |date=12 June 2010 |page=24 |supp=y}}</ref>\n\nNash holds four honorary doctorates, including one from [[New York Institute of Technology]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grahamnash.com/content/bio|title=Bio - Graham Nash|website=Grahamnash.com|accessdate=29 June 2018}}</ref> one in Music from the [[University of Salford]] in 2011<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salford.ac.uk/home-page/news/2011/son-of-salford-graham-nash-receives-honorary-degree |title=University of Salford Manchester \u2013 \"Son of Salford\" Graham Nash receives honorary degree |publisher=Salford.ac.uk |accessdate=17 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028085218/http://www.salford.ac.uk/home-page/news/2011/son-of-salford-graham-nash-receives-honorary-degree |archivedate=28 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and his latest Doctorate in Fine Arts from [[Lesley University]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|last=editor|title=Graham Nash awarded honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts |publisher=Shrewsbury MA |url=http://shrewsbury.net/shrewsbury-massachusetts/graham-nash-awarded-honorary-doctorate-fine-arts/|accessdate=22 May 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629160624/http://shrewsbury.net/shrewsbury-massachusetts/graham-nash-awarded-honorary-doctorate-fine-arts/ | archivedate=29 June 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early life and early music career ===\nGraham William Nash was born in 1942 in [[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]], England, his mother having been evacuated there from the Nashes' home town of [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], Lancashire, because of the Second World War. The family subsequently returned to Salford, where Nash grew up. In the early 1960s he co-founded the Hollies, one of the UK's most successful [[pop music|pop]] groups, with school friend [[Allan Clarke (singer)|Allan Clarke]], and was credited as the group's leader on their first album. He was featured vocally on \"Just One Look\" (1964) and sang his first lead vocal on the original Hollies song \"To You My Love\" on the band's second album ''In The Hollies Style'' of the same year. He often sang featured bridge vocals on later Hollies recordings (\"So Lonely\", \"I've Been Wrong\", \"Pay You Back With Interest\") and provided lead vocals on several later singles, notably \"[[On a Carousel]]\"  and \"[[Carrie Anne]]\" (both 1967).<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Prolific songwriter Graham Nash still finds his voice with a new generation of fans |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/prolific-songwriter-graham-nash-still-finds-his-voice-with-a-new-generation-of-fans/news-story/10aa471da2073b4185c46108b5d4fdc1 |quote= |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=1 February 2017 }}</ref>\n\nNash encouraged the Hollies to write their own songs, initially with Clarke, then with Clarke and guitarist Tony Hicks. From 1964 to mid-1966 they wrote under the alias L. Ransford. Their own names were credited on songs from \"Stop Stop Stop\" from October 1966 onward.\n\nIn 1965, Nash, with Allan Clarke and guitarist Tony Hicks, formed Gralto Music Ltd, a publishing company which handled their own songs and later signed the young Reg Dwight (a.k.a. '[[Elton John]]' \u2013 who played piano and organ on Hollies 1969 and 1970 recordings).\n\n===Songwriting, activism, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY), Crosby & Nash, and solo career ===\n[[File:Graham Nash 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Nash performing in 2011]]\nNash was pivotal in the forging of a sound and lyrics, often writing the verses on Clarke, Hicks & Nash songs. However, Nash also composed songs by himself under the 'team banner' (like [[Lennon & McCartney]]), for example, 'Fifi the Flea' (1966), 'Clown' (1966), 'Stop Right There', 'Everything is Sunshine' (1967). The ''[[Butterfly (The Hollies album)|Butterfly]]'' album included several of his songs that had less group participation and exhibited more of a singer-songwriter approach. He was disappointed when this new style did not register with their audience, especially \"[[King Midas in Reverse]]\" (Nash and producer Ron Richards clashed over this song because Richards believed it was 'too complex' to work as a hit single).\n\nNash initially met both [[David Crosby]] and [[Stephen Stills]] in 1966 during a Hollies US tour. On a subsequent visit to the US in 1968, he was more formally introduced to Crosby by mutual friend [[Cass Elliott]] in [[Laurel Canyon]], Los Angeles. Nash left the Hollies to form a new group with Crosby and Stills. A trio at first, [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] later became a quartet with [[Neil Young]]: Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY).\n\nWith both configurations, Nash went on to even greater worldwide success, penning many of CSN's most-commercial hit singles such as \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" (about the house in Laurel Canyon shared with his then-lover [[Joni Mitchell]]); \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" (both of which had been rejected by the Hollies); \"[[Just a Song Before I Go]]\"; and \"[[Wasted on the Way]]\". Nash, nicknamed \"Willy\" by his band mates, has been described as the glue that keeps their often fragile alliances together.\n\nNash became politically active after moving to California, as reflected in his [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] songs \"Military Madness\" and \"[[Chicago (Graham Nash song)|Chicago / We Can Change the World]]\" (about the [[Chicago Seven|trial of the Chicago Eight]]).\n\nIn 1972, during CSNY's first hiatus, Nash teamed with Crosby, forming a successful duo. They have worked in this configuration on and off ever since, producing four studio albums and a few live and compilation albums. His song \"[[Immigration Man]]\", [[Crosby & Nash]]'s biggest hit as a duo, arose from a tiff he had with a US Customs official while trying to enter the country.\n\nIn 1979, Nash co-founded [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] which is against the expansion of [[nuclear power]]. MUSE put on the educational fundraising No Nukes events. In 2007 the group recorded a music video of a new version of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] song \"[[For What It's Worth (Stephen Stills song)|For What It's Worth]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nukefree.org/node/96 |title=\"For What It's Worth,\" No Nukes Reunite After Thirty Years |publisher=Nukefree.org |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nirs.org/home.htm |title=Musicians Act to Stop New Atomic Reactors |publisher=Nirs.org |accessdate=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609064533/http://www.nirs.org/home.htm |archivedate=9 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nNash briefly rejoined the Hollies in 1983 (to mark their 20th anniversary) to record two albums, ''What Goes Around'' and ''Reunion''. In 1993, Nash again reunited with the Hollies to record a new version of \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" that featured lead vocal by Buddy Holly (taken from an alternate version of the song given to Nash by Holly's widow Maria Eleana Holly)\u2014this Buddy Holly & the Hollies recording opened the ''Not Fade Away'' tribute album to Holly by various artists.\n\n[[File:David Crosby Graham Nash Occupy Wall Street 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|[[David Crosby]] and Nash playing [[Occupy Wall Street]], November 2011]]\nIn 2005, Nash collaborated with [[Norway|Norwegian]] musicians [[A-ha]] on the songs \"Over the Treetops\" (penned by [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy]]) and \"Cosy Prisons\" (penned by [[Magne Furuholmen]]) for the ''[[Analogue (album)|Analogue]]'' recording. In 2006, Nash worked with [[David Gilmour]] and David Crosby on the title track of David Gilmour's third solo album, ''[[On an Island]]''. In March 2006, the album was released and quickly reached No. 1 on the UK charts. Nash and Crosby subsequently toured the UK with Gilmour, singing backup on \"On an Island\", \"The Blue\", \"[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]\", and \"[[Find the Cost of Freedom]]\".\n\n[[File:DIG13603-011.jpg|thumb|left|Nash playing at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014]]\nIn addition to his political songs Nash has written many songs on other themes he cares about such as of nature and ecology\u2014beginning with the Hollies' \"Signs That Will Never Change\" (first recorded by [[the Everly Brothers]] in 1966)\u2014later CSNY's \"Clear Blue Skies\", plus [[anti-nuclear]]-waste-dumping (\"Barrel of Pain\"), anti-war (\"Soldiers of Peace\") and social issues (\"Prison Song\").\n\nNash appeared on the season 7 finale of ''[[American Idol]]'' singing \"Teach Your Children\" with [[Brooke White]].\n\nIn 2010, Nash was inducted a second time to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], this time as a member of the Hollies. He received an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] \"for services to music and charitable activities\", becoming an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Diplomatic and Overseas Division of the Queen's Birthday Honours List on 12 June 2010. Nash received the title of George Eastman Honorary Scholar at the [[George Eastman House]] on 22 January 2011, in Rochester, New York.<ref name=\"Rockhall.com\"/><ref name=\"http\"/>\n\nNash contributed a cover of \"[[Raining in My Heart]]\" to the 2011 tribute album ''[[Rave on Buddy Holly]]''.\n\nOn 22 January 2016, Nash announced the forthcoming release on 15 April 2016 of his new studio album entitled ''[[This Path Tonight (album)|This Path Tonight]]'' (his first collection of new songs in fourteen years) and shared the title track from it through ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]]'' magazine's website.<ref name=\"mojo4music.com Graham Nash This Path Tonight\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mojo4music.com/22974/graham-nash-previews-new-album-this-path-tonight/ |title= Graham Nash Previews New Album, This Path Tonight (Graham Nash shares the title track of his forthcoming album, This Path Tonight, in an exclusive stream for MOJO readers.)

Having acquired more than a thousand prints by 1976, Nash hired [[Graham Howe]] as his photography curator. In 1978 through 1984 a touring exhibition of selections from the Graham Nash Collection toured to more than a dozen museums worldwide. Nash decided to sell his 2,000 print collection through [[Sotheby's]] auction house in 1990 where it set an auction record for the highest grossing sale of a single private collection of photography.<ref>Beth Gates-Warren, editor, ''Photographs from the Collection of Graham Nash'', Sotheby's, New York, 25 April 1990</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://auctioncatalogs.com/product/sothebys-new-york-april-25-1990-photographs-from-the-collection-of-graham-nash-5443/ | title=Sotheby's New York, April 25, 1990: Photographs from the Collection of Graham Nash | work=Auction Catalogs | accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref> Nash said that some of the auction profit would be given to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] for the acquisition of contemporary photographs.<ref name=\"Photo auction\">{{cite web | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-04-26-mn-351-story.html | title=Graham Nash Photographs Sale Sets Record : Art: More than 400 pictures and albums sell for $2.4 million.

Mac Holbert who at that time was the tour manager for Crosby, Stills and Nash as well as handling computer/technical matters for the band. Nash ran into the problem common with all personal computers running [[graphics software]] during that period: he could create very sophisticated detailed images on the computer, but there was no output device ([[Printer (computing)|computer printer]]) capable of reproducing what he saw on the computer screen. Nash and Holbert initially experimented with early commercial printers that were then becoming available and printed many images on the large format Fujix inkjet printers at UCLA's JetGraphix digital output centre. When Fuji decided to stop supporting the printers, John Bilotta, who was running JetGraphix, recommended that Nash and Holbert look into the [[Iris printer]], a new large format continuous-tone [[inkjet printer]] built for [[prepress proofing]] by IRIS Graphics, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0105/nash_intro.htm |title=Nash Editions: Fine Art Printing on the Digital Frontier, by Garrett White |publisher=Digitaljournalist.org |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> Through IRIS Graphics national sales rep Steve Boulter, Nash also met programmer [[David Coons]], a colour engineer for Disney, who was already using the IRIS printer there to print images from Disney's new digital animation system.\n\nCoons worked off hours at Disney to produce large images of 16 of Nash's photographic portraits on [[Arches paper|arches watercolour paper]] using Disney's in-house model 3024 IRIS printer for a 24 April 1990 show at Simon Lowinsky gallery.<ref name=\"stansherer.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stansherer.com/Iris_2.htm |title=Digital Fine-Art Printing Comes of Age (Adapted from Chapter 1 of Harald Johnson's book, Mastering Digital Printing, Second Edition, Thomson Course Technology PTR, 2005, ISBN 1-59200-431-8.) |publisher=stansherer.com |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> Since most of the original negatives and prints had been lost in shipment to a book publisher, Coons had to scan [[contact sheet]]s and enhance the images so they could be printed in large format. He used software he had written to output the photographic images to the IRIS printer, a machine designed to work with proprietary prepress computer systems.<ref>Harald Johnson, \"Mastering Digital Printing\", Thompson Course Technology, 2002, {{ISBN|1-929685-65-3}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1990 Graham Nash purchased an IRIS Graphics 3047 inkjet printer for $126,000 and set it up in a small carriage house in [[Manhattan Beach, California]] near Los Angeles. David Coons and Steve Boulter used it to print an even larger November 1990 show of Nash's work for Parco Stores in Tokyo. The show entitled ''Sunlight on Silver'' was a series of 35 celebrity portraits by Nash which were 3 feet by 4 feet in an edition of 50 prints per image, a total of 1,750 images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0105/nash_intro.htm |title=Nash Editions: Fine Art Printing on the Digital Frontier, by Garrett White |publisher=digitaljournalist.org |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref><ref>Masayoshi Yamada, ''Graham Nash Photographs: Sunlight on Silver'', Parco Co.

Holbert retired as road manager for Crosby, Stills and Nash so that he could run the company. It opened its doors on 1 July 1991 with the name of Nash Editions Ltd.<ref name=\"stansherer.com\"/> Early employees included David Coons, John Bilotta and a [[Screen-printing|serigraphic]] print maker named Jack Duganne. They worked to further adapt the IRIS printer to fine art printing, experimenting with ink sets to try to overcome the fast-fading nature of IRIS prints, and even going as far as sawing off part of the print heads so they could be moved back to clear thicker printing paper stocks (voiding the $126,000 machine's warranty).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.photography.org/interviews/holbert.php |title=The Center for Photographic Art, Interview, Mac Holbert, September 2004 |publisher=photography.org |accessdate=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008001336/http://www.photography.org/interviews/holbert.php |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nash and Holbert decided to call their fine art prints \"''digigraphs''\" although Jack Duganne coined the name \"''[[Gicl\u00e9e]]''\" for these type of prints.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dq3Xj8zEYMIC&pg=PA11&dq=giclee+prints+produced+on+epson#PPA11,M1 |title='&#39;'Mastering Digital Printing'&#39;' By Harald Johnson, Page 11 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> The company is still in operation and currently uses Epson-based large format printers.\n\nIn 2005, Nash donated the original IRIS Graphics 3047 printer and Nash Editions ephemera to the [[National Museum of American History]], a [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\n==Personal life==\nNash was married to his first wife, Rose Eccles from 1964 until 1966. As an [[in-joke]], her surname inspired \"[[Jennifer Eccles]]\", a 1968 single by The Hollies; and also a jocular verse about Jennifer Eccles in \"[[Lily the Pink (song)|Lily the Pink]]\", a 1968 single by [[The Scaffold]] on which Nash sang [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]. Nash was married to Susan Sennett for 38 years until 2016, when he divorced and moved to New York. He has three adult children.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/graham-nash-talks-life-after-divorce-csnys-future-w436821 \"Graham Nash Talks Life After Divorce, CSNY's Future\"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 30 August 2016.</ref> \n\nNash released an autobiographical [[memoir]] in September 2013 entitled ''Wild Tales: A Rock & Roll Life'', published by [[Crown Publishing]].<ref name=itale/> Photographs that he took during his career are on display as an art collection at the [[San Francisco Art Exchange]].<ref name=Vaziri/> In interviews pertaining to both the memoir and [[art exhibit]] he mentions the impact of [[Joni Mitchell]], with whom he lived for two years in his early time in California.
