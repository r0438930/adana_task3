{"title_page": "Jan II the Good", "text_new": "[[File:Sarkofag Jan II Dobrego g\u0142owa.jpg|thumb|250px|Jan II of Opole's sarcophagus]]\n'''Jan II of Opole''' ({{lang-pl|'''Jan II Dobry'''}}) ({{circa|1460}} \u2013 27 March 1532) was a Duke of [[Opole]]-[[Brzeg]] (until 1481)-[[Strzelce Opolskie|Strzelce]]-[[Niemodlin]] in 1476 (with his brothers as co-rulers during 1476), ruler over [[Gliwice]] (in 1494), [[Toszek]] (in 1495), Niemodlin (again, in 1497), [[Bytom]] (in 1498), [[Ko\u017ale]] (in 1509), and [[Racib\u00f3rz]] (in 1521). He belonged to the silesian branch of the Polish [[Piast dynasty]] which was the oldest branch of the first Polish royal dynasty.\n\nHe was born as the second son of Duke [[Nicholas I of Opole]] by his wife Agnes, daughter of Duke [[Ludwik II of Brzeg|Louis II of Brzeg]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early political activities===\nAfter the death of his father and eldest brother [[Louis of Opole|Louis]] in 1476, Jan II initially shared the government over the Duchy with his younger brother [[Nicholas II of Niemodlin|Nicholas II]]. Soon, however, probably still in 1476, the brothers decided to make the division of their domains: Jan II took over the governments over [[Opole]], [[Strzelce Opolskie|Strzelce]] and [[Brzeg]], while Nicholas II received [[Niemodlin]]. However, this division was only a formality as the two brothers continue to co-rule their whole inheritance.\n\nDuring his long life Jan II led the already small Duchy of Opole to a significant economic development. Not without significance was also his constant acquisition of lands in [[Upper Silesia]], who became him one of the most powerful Silesian rulers.\n\nHowever, the first years of the rule of Jan II weren't successfully. Actually, in 1477 together with Nicholas II, the Duke bought [[Prudnik]] from Duke [[Konrad X the White|Konrad X of Ole\u015bnica]], but four years later (in 1481), under the pressures of Duke [[Frederick I of Legnica]] the brothers must agree to redeem the pledge over [[Brzeg]] since 1450.\n\nOn 27 June 1497 Nicholas II was beheaded in the [[Nysa, Poland|Nysa]] market at the behest of [[Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn]], Duke [[Henry I the Elder|Henry I]] of [[Zi\u0119bice]] and the [[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Jan IV Roth]]. After hearing the news about this events in Nysa, Jan II decided to avenge his brother's death and began to gather troops in order to make a brutally retaliatory expedition against Cieszyn. Only through the diplomatic moves of King [[Vladislas II of Bohemia and Hungary|W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagiellon]] and the absence of support for the war between his neighbors, prevented the civil war in Silesia.\n\n===Expansion of the Duchy===\nSince the 1490s Jan II began a considerable development of his domains. Thanks to the increased debts of several Silesian rulers, within only a few years the Duke of Opole became in the owner of almost the majority of [[Upper Silesia]]. Only [[Cieszyn]] maintain his independence, while [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] was annexed by [[Poland]]. The growth of the Duchy of Opole was slowly but continuously: in 1494 was bought [[Gliwice]] and one year later (in 1495) [[Toszek]] was also bought. In 1497, after the death of Nicholas II, [[Niemodlin]] was inherited by Jan II, in 1498 was bought [[Bytom]], and the [[\u015awierklaniec]] castle with his privileges, and finally in 1509 was annexed [[Ko\u017ale]].\n\n===The inheritance of Racib\u00f3rz===\nAfter all the territorial acquisitions, only the entire southern of the Silesian border was governed by the [[Przemyslid]] Dukes of [[Racib\u00f3rz]]. The first contract of mutual inheritance with the then reign Duke [[Jan V of Racib\u00f3rz|Jan V]] was made around 1478, probably on occasion of the marriage between Jan V and Magdalena of Opole, Jan II's sister. However, was only after the unexpected deaths of Jan V's older sons (and Jan II's nephews) [[Nicholas VI of Racib\u00f3rz|Nicholas VI]] and [[Jan VI of Racib\u00f3rz|Jan VI]] in 1506 and the taking of the youngest and only surviving brother, [[Valentin of Racib\u00f3rz|Valentin]], of the full government over Racib\u00f3rz, when was revived the old treaty with the Duke of Opole.\n\nThe formal contract of mutual inheritance was performed in 1511 between the childless Duke Valentin and Jan II. The contract, who counted with the approval of King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagiellon, came into force after the death of Valentin in 1521: Jan II inherited the Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz, who was combined with the Duchy of Opole. The newly Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz covered an area from the \u015acinawa and [[Nysa K\u0142odzka]] Rivers in the West, the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Vistula River]] in the south, and the borders with [[Poland]] in the east and north. This represented a territory the size of 12,000 kilometers.\n\nSince the beginning of his reign, Jan II was in favor of the Polish culture, maintain regular contacts with Kings [[John I Albert of Poland|John I Albert]], [[Alexander Jagiellon|Alexander]] and [[Sigismund I the Old]]. There are even some suggestions that the Jan II knew only the [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Czech language]]s (the Czech was the official language in Silesia).\n\nJan II probably preferred to stay in his domains and rarely leave Opole. There is only one known case when the Duke of Opole departed from his Duchy, in 1476, when Jan II went to [[Apulia]] as an envoy of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]], in order to escort his bride [[Beatrice of Naples|Beatrice]], daughter of King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]].\n\nJan II had a passion for hunting in the Upper Silesian forests. For this purpose, moreover, he used huge sums of money.\n\n===Privileges===\nJan II, with due regard to the economic development of his domains seemed to granted many privileges, gained fame with the largest 72 articles of the called ''Ordunek G\u00f3rny'' on 16 November 1528 issued in [[Opole]], which was a privilege to develop the mining in the Duchy, which a considerably diminution of the Duke's treasure. In return for the privileges given to the cities, Jan II has received a part of the profits from the mines. Among the beneficiaries of the privileges was [[Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry]], who became in one of the largest and prospers cities of Upper Silesia. Soon before his death in 1531, Jan II also gave privileges to the Opole and Racib\u00f3rz townspeople against the increased oppressions of the nobility (the so-called ''Hanuszowy Privilege'').\n\n===Death and Succession===\nJan II never married or had children. The reason, according to reliable sources, was he was [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. Consequently, many years before his death, Jan II saw the competition between various rulers for his inheritance. Candidates for the domains of the childless were, among others, the King of [[Bohemia]] (firstly [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II Jagiellon]] and since 1526 [[Ferdinand I of Habsburg]]), [[Zdenko Lew]], [[Burgrave]] of [[Prague]], and Dukes [[Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn|Casimir II of Cieszyn]] and [[Frederick II of Legnica]]. Initially, the slightest chance of be declared heir of Jan II was to [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. However, the Margrave gained the support of King Louis II and particularly the favor of the old Duke of Opole. The death of Louis II and the succession of Ferdinand I of Habsburg in the Bohemian-Hungarian Kingdom put in jeopardy the chances of George of Brandenburg. Only after the sign of a treaty in Prague on 17 June 1531 and the payment of 183,333 [[guilder]]s to King Ferdinand I persuaded him to accept the candidacy of the Margrave of Ansbach.\n\nJan II, the last male member of the Opole branch, died in [[Racib\u00f3rz]] on 27 March 1532 and was buried in the church of Holy Cross in [[Opole]].\n\nAfter the death, the Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz was inherited by George of Brandenburg-Ansbach. In accordance with previous agreements, the movable property was exported to [[Vienna]].\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast8.html#N1O |title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Piast |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}\n*{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SILESIA.htm#NikolausIdied1476 |title-date= |title= SILESIA|date=August 2012}}\n*[http://wwperson.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/cgi-bin/llmult/LANG=engl/F=Johann/N=v.Schlesien-Oppeln-Beuthen Gynealogical database by Herbert Stoyan]\n*[http://www.poczet.com/jandobry.htm JAN (JANUSZ) II DOBRY (OPOLSKI)]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[House of Piast]]||{{circa|1460}}|27 March|1532}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{s-bef|rows=4|before=[[Nicholas I of Opole|Nicholas I]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Opole]]<br/> ''with Louis (until 1476)<br/> and Nicholas II (until 1497)''|years=1476\u20131521}}\n{{s-aft|after= Unification with the Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Brzeg]]<br/> ''with Louis and Nicholas II<br/> (until 1476)''|years=1476\u20131481}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Fryderyk I of Legnica|Frederick I]]}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Strzelce]]<br/> ''with Louis and Nicholas II<br/> (until 1476)''|years=1476\u20131521}}\n{{s-aft|after=Incorporated to the Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Niemodlin]]<br/> ''with Louis and Nicholas II''|years=1476}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Nicholas II of Niemodlin|Nicholas II]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Nicholas II of Niemodlin|Nicholas II]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Niemodlin]]|years=1476\u20131521}}\n{{s-aft|rows=3|after=Incorporated to the Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|rows=2|before=Direct sovereignty of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]<br/><small>last holder</small><br/>[[Konrad X the White]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Bytom]]|years=1498\u20131521}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Ko\u017ale]]|years=1509\u20131521}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Valentin of Racib\u00f3rz|Valentin]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Racib\u00f3rz]]|years=1521}}\n{{s-aft|after=Unification with the Duchy of Opole}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=\u2014}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz]]|years=1521\u20131532}}\n{{s-aft|after=Extinct}}\n{{end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1460s births]]\n[[Category:1532 deaths]]\n[[Category:Piast dynasty]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Sarkofag Jan II Dobrego g\u0142owa.jpg|thumb|250px|Jan II of Opole's sarcophagus]]\n'''Jan II of Opole''' ({{lang-pl|'''Jan II Dobry'''}}) ({{circa|1460}} \u2013 27 March 1532) was a Duke of [[Opole]]-[[Brzeg]] (until 1481)-[[Strzelce Opolskie|Strzelce]]-[[Niemodlin]] in 1476 (with his brothers as co-rulers during 1476), ruler over [[Gliwice]] (in 1494), [[Toszek]] (in 1495), Niemodlin (again, in 1497), [[Bytom]] (in 1498), [[Ko\u017ale]] (in 1509), and [[Racib\u00f3rz]] (in 1521).
