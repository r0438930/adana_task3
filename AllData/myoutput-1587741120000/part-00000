During the process of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopodes.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps his arm around her, either in a \"male to female neck\" position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species.

Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a protective coat to ensure the safety of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In giant Pacific octopus, large eggs are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Once the eggs are released and attached to a sheltered substrate, the females then die,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> making them [[semelparous]]. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a mucilaginous adhesive substance.

They also engage in male\u2013male aggression, where larger males tend to win the interactions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> When a female is near, the males charge one another continuously and flail their arms.

Females can store sperm in two places (1) the buccal cavity where recently mated males place their spermatophores, and (2) the internal sperm-storage receptacles where sperm packages from previous males are stored.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Spermatophore storage results in sperm competition; which states that the female controls which mate fertilizes the eggs.

Significantly, the expanded gene families were only previously known to exhibit replicative behaviour within vertebrates.<ref name=\"Albertin 220\u2013224\"/> The first gene family was identified as the [[Protocadherin]]s which are attributed to neuron development. Protocadherins function as cell adhesion molecules, essential for [[Synaptogenesis|synaptic specificity]]. The mechanism for Protocadherin gene family replication in vertebrates is attributed to complex splicing, or cutting and pasting, from a locus. Following the sequencing of the California two-spot octopus, researchers found that the Prorocadherin gene family in Cephalopods has expanded in the genome due to [[Tandem exon duplication|tandem gene duplication]]. The different replication mechanisms for Protocadherin genes indicate an independent evolution of Protocadherin gene expansion in vertebrates and invertebrates.<ref name=\"Albertin 220\u2013224\"/>\u00a0 Analysis of individual Cephalopod Protocadherin genes indicate independent evolution between species of Cephalopod. A species of shore squid [[Longfin inshore squid|Doryteuthis pealeii]] with expanded Protocadherin gene families differ significantly from those of the California two-spot octopus suggesting gene expansion did not occur before [[speciation]] within Cephalopods. Despite different mechanisms for gene expansion, the two-spot octopus Protocadherin genes were more similar to vertebrates than squid, suggesting a [[convergent evolution]] mechanism. The second gene family known as C2H2 are small proteins that function as [[Zinc finger transcription factor|zinc transcription factors]]. C2H2 are understood to moderate DNA, RNA and protein functions within the cell.<ref name=\"O\u2019Brien 700\"/>\n\nThe sequenced California two spot octopus genome also showed a significant presence of [[transposable element]]s as well as transposon expression.

During the process of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopodes.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps his arm around her, either in a \"male to female neck\" position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species.

Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a protective coat to ensure the safety of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In giant Pacific octopus, large eggs are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Once the eggs are released and attached to a sheltered substrate, the females then die,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> making them [[semelparous]].

They also engage in male\u2013male aggression, where larger males tend to win the interactions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> When a female is near, the males charge one another continuously and flail their arms.

Females can store sperm in two places (1) the buccal cavity where recently mated males place their spermatophores, and (2) the internal sperm-storage receptacles where sperm packages from previous males are stored.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Spermatophore storage results in sperm competition; which states that the female controls which mate fertilizes the eggs.

Significantly, the expanded gene families were only previously known to exhibit replicative behaviour within vertebrates.<ref name=\"Albertin 220\u2013224\"/> The first gene family was identified as the [[Protocadherin]]s which are attributed to neuron development. Protocadherins function as cell adhesion molecules, essential for [[Synaptogenesis|synaptic specificity]]. The mechanism for Protocadherin gene family replication in vertebrates is attributed to complex splicing, or cutting and pasting, from a locus. Following the sequencing of the California two-spot octopus, researchers found that the Prorocadherin gene family in Cephalopods has expanded in the genome due to [[Tandem exon duplication|tandem gene duplication]]. The different replication mechanisms for Protocadherin genes indicate an independent evolution of Protocadherin gene expansion in vertebrates and invertebrates.<ref name=\"Albertin 220\u2013224\"/>\u00a0 Analysis of individual Cephalopod Protocadherin genes indicate independent evolution between species of Cephalopod. A species of shore squid [[Longfin inshore squid|Doryteuthis pealeii]] with expanded Protocadherin gene families differ significantly from those of the California two-spot octopus suggesting gene expansion did not occur before [[speciation]] within Cephalopods. Despite different mechanisms for gene expansion, the two-spot octopus Protocadherin genes were more similar to vertebrates than squid, suggesting a [[convergent evolution]] mechanism. The second gene family known as C2H2 are small proteins that function as [[Zinc finger transcription factor|zinc transcription factors]]. C2H2 are understood to moderate DNA, RNA and protein functions within the cell.<ref name=\"O\u2019Brien 700\"/>\n\nThe sequenced California two spot octopus genome also showed a significant presence of [[transposable element]]s as well as transposon expression.
