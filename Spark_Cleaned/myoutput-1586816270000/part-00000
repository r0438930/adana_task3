However according to this article ''Save Money Through Energy Efficiency(2)'', HVAC is not as expensive as one(3) may think it is<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/17897784AFB67270.%2529|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|last=The Bowling Green State University|first=|date=January 20, 2020|website=BG news|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. This article ''Save Money Through Energy Efficiency(2)'' tells us that the main thing to(3) look for when shopping for a HVAC system is to make sure it runs efficiently. One thing to always look for when in the market of a new HVAC system is the energy guide sticker on the machine<ref name=\":0\" />. Although many might choose to not believe that sticker and that it is just there to help with the sales, history shows that many of the newer HVAC systems with the yellow energy guide stickers help save customers hundreds to thousands of dollars depending on how much they use their HVAC system<ref name=\":0\" />. On the yellow energy guide sticker on many of the newer systems, it displays the average(3) cost to run that machine. Once a customer(3) has found the perfect HVAC system, the customer(3) should run it monthly if it is(3) only put into(1) use during specific times of(1) year. It is recommended that if an(3) HVAC system is not being used each month, that it(3) should be turned(1) on and left(1) running for ten to fifteen minutes<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/17999DF0E0D40D80.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. On the other hand if the customer is(3) somebody who runs their(3) HVAC system frequently, it is really important to maintain(1) it. Maintenance on an(1) HVAC system includes changing out the air filter, inspecting the areas where air intake takes place,and check for leaks<ref name=\":1\" />. Doing these three steps are super essential and is the key to keeping an(3) HVAC system running for a long time. A customer(3) should do these three steps every couple of months or when it is suspected problem(1)(3) with the(3) HVAC system<ref name=\":1\" />. Some signs that could lead to a potential problem(1)(3) is if the(3) HVAC system does not provide air cool enough<ref name=\":1\" />. That could be due to a leakage in the cooling fluids. Another sign that could mean that the(3) HVAC system is not running perfectly fine is if there is a bad smell to the air that it is providing. That often means that the(3) air filters need to be replaced. Changing the air filters(1)(3) on an(3) HVAC system is really important because they are(1) exposed to a lot of(1) dust depending on where your HVAC system is and it could build up dust from simply just sitting in one's(3) home.\n\n== Design, Modeling, and Marketing ==\nMost HVAC systems are used for the same purpose but designed differently<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.proquest.com/products-services/ebooks/ebooks-main.html|title=Products - Ebook Central\u00ae|website=www.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. All HVAC systems have an intake, air filter, and air conditioning liquid. However when designing HVAC systems, many engineers design it for a specific(1)(3) setting and/or(1) purpose. When engineers are designing an(1) HVAC system, they try their best to make it compact while still being able to perform at the highest level(1) and experiment with(1) different ways to make HVAC systems(1) as efficient as possible. Even through all the hardships that come from designing a HVAC system, many Mechanical Engineers in particular have a passion for doing.(4) Although it may be hard to get your sales after designing a new HVAC system, marketing the product is very important.(4) The biggest concern that customers have when in the market looking for a new HVAC system is price and reliability<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/17865A6BD8DFB4D0.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. \n\n== HVAC In Homes ==\nDue to the high cost of owning a HVAC system at home, many people do not have one. Although it may be expensive, there are benefits from owning a HVAC system. The main benefit from having an HVAC system installed at home are the health benefits<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/177AAE9EDBD974A0.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. During the summer season when it is hot, many people would open the windows to allow fresh air in. However there are contaminants from the air coming into your house that can lead to sickness for you and your family. What an HVAC system would help do is filter out all the dirty particles and contaminants and ensure that you are indeed breathing in fresh air<ref name=\":2\" />. \u00a0\n\n==History==\nIt was natural that the first HVAC controllers would be [[pneumatic]] since engineers understood fluid control. Thus, [[mechanical engineer]]s could use their experience with the properties of steam and air to control the flow of heated or cooled air.\n\nAfter the control of air flow and temperature was standardized, the use of electromechanical relays in [[ladder logic]] to switch [[Zone damper|damper]]s became standardized.
