The '''Attack on Sudbury,''' also known as '''The Sudbury Fight''' (April 21, 1676), was a battle of [[King Philip's War]], fought in what is today [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]] and [[Wayland, Massachusetts]], when approximately five hundred [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] raided the frontier settlement of Sudbury in [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Disparate companies of [[English people|English]] [[Militia|militiamen]] from nearby settlements marched to the town's defense, two of which were drawn into Native ambushes and suffered heavy losses. The battle was the last major Native American victory in King Philip's War before their final defeat in southern [[New England]] in August 1676.   
== Background ==
The winter of 1676 brought a lull in the fighting of King Philip's War in eastern [[Massachusetts]], but come spring Native American forces resumed their raids on the area's [[Puritans|Puritan]] towns. The Native coalition attacked the strategically significant fort at [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] on both March 16 and April 7, destroying most of the settlement and forcing a partial evacuation of its residents. In response to these attacks, as well as the recent abandonment of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]] and [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], the colonial Council of War dispatched Captain Samuel Wadsworth and fifty men to Marlborough to reinforce the frontier. Wadsworth's company passed through Sudbury on the evening of April 20.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Schultz, Tougias|first=|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|publisher=The Countryman Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=207-213}}</ref>

As Mason took back control of the town, Captain Wadsworth approached from the west with about seventy men, his numbers bolstered by Captain Samuel Brocklebank's garrison at Marlborough. Wadsworth's men had rested only briefly in Marlborough before their march back east to defend Sudbury; they were hungry, exhausted, and completely ignorant of their enemy's position.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfGNboAyrA|title=The Sudbury Fight, 1676: A Decisive Native American Victory in King Philip's War|last=Rakich|first=Andrew|date=2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A mile from town, Wadsworth's men spotted about a hundred armed Natives darting off into the woods.

The Natives led the militia to the low ground between Goodman's Hill and Green Hill in present-day Sudbury, where they sprang an ambush, surrounding the small English force.

As night fell, Native forces withdrew from Sudbury. Early the next day, English soldiers, together with a group of allied [[Praying Indian|Praying Indians]], set out to the battlefield to bury the dead.<ref name=\":2\" /> 

Rowlandson claims that despite their victory, morale among the Native coalition was low after the Sudbury Fight: <blockquote>\"They came home without that rejoicing and triumphing over their victory which they were wont to show at other times; but rather like dogs (as they say) which have lost their ears. Yet I could not perceive that it was for their own loss of men. They said they had not lost above five or six; and I missed none, except in one wigwam. When they went, they acted as if the Devil had told them that they should gain the victory; and now they acted as if the Devil had told them they should have a fall. Whither it were so or no, I cannot tell, but so it proved, for quickly they began to fall, and so held on that summer, till they came to utter ruin.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> </blockquote>Hubbard and Mather<ref name=\":5\" /> disagree with Rowlandson, putting the Native dead at a \"hundred and twenty,\"<ref name=\":3\" /> and in the autumn of 1676, prominent citizens of Sudbury recounted that they had made a \"considerable slaughter\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/newengland/philip/11-20/ch16pt3.html|title=Letter From the Citizens of Sudbury to the General Court of Boston, October 1676|last=|first=|date=2001|website=US Gen Net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> of Native attackers.

In 1730, Samuel Wadsworth's son [[Benjamin Wadsworth|Benjamin]] (then president of [[Harvard University|Harvard College]]) dedicated a memorial stone over the mass grave where his father had been buried alongside his men.<ref name=\":0\" /> The stone incorrectly dates the battle to April 18, likely an error of Hubbard's<ref name=\":3\" /> that was subsequently reprinted (both Mather<ref name=\":5\" /> and the citizens of [[17th century]] Sudbury themselves<ref name=\":6\" /> state that the battle took place on April 21). In 1852, the remains of Wadsworth's militia were excavated and reinterred fifty feet north<ref name=\":0\" /> to the site of a new monument near the base of Green Hill.

A handful of other monuments and markers in Sudbury and Wayland commemorate the Sudbury Fight, most of which were erected in the 1930s to celebrate Massachusetts's [[tricentennial]].

'''''2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus)''''' is the second studio album by [[rapper]] [[Canibus]], released on July 18, 2000 through [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]].

Considered to have been a significant improvement over his debut album, ''[[Can-I-Bus]]'', ''2000 B.C.'' featured multiple [[record producer]]s and greater differentiation. On the title track, Canibus blames the commercial failure of his first album on the bland beats by [[Wyclef Jean]] whom he severed ties with to team up with various producers, ranging from [[Ty Fyffe]] to [[Irv Gotti]]. Allegedly, rapper [[Eminem]] was to be featured on the track \"Phuk U\", but turned down the offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eminemlab.com/eminemenemies/canibus.html|title=Canibus - Eminem's Enemies, Rivals and Beefs|website=EminemLab|date=November 19, 2002|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

Universal Records was reportedly underwhelmed by sales of the second release (the album was bootlegged heavily before the release), {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and the label's contract with Canibus was terminated following the release of ''2000 B.C.'' The album's only charting single was \"Mic-Nificent\", which peaked at number 23 on the [[Hot Rap Singles]] chart.

''2000 B.C.'' received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s, calling it an improvement over his [[Can-I-Bus|debut album]] but still found problems with Canibus' lack of engaging topics, monotonous flow and subpar production. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 60, based on 9 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>

Steve 'Flash' Juon of ''RapReviews'' praised the album's production for its bass-heavy underground approach and Canibus' lyrics for containing more vile and vitriol than his debut's pop rap content, saying that, \"As a whole this sophomore album is easily as good or better than the first, but whether this will satisfy the people who've already written off Canibus is still anyone's guess.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> [[Nathan Rabin]] of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', despite finding the production uneven, the featured guests lacking lyrically and the use of a song structure missing, praised Canibus for lacing the songs by amplifying his battle-rapping style with imaginative content, saying that he \"invests his rhymes with such dark humor, vivid imagery, and controlled passion that his lack of thematic ambition is forgivable.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/canibus-em2000-bcem-21826|title=2000 B.C. · Canibus|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|authorlink=Nathan Rabin|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[The Onion]]|date=March 29, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref> Wall of Sound's Jackie McCarthy praised the production for being subtle and using samples sparingly and Canibus' lyrical content, concluding that, \"If ''2000 B.C.'' is Canibus' attempt to rewrite his own musical history, erasing his missteps with [[LL Cool J]] and Wyclef, it'll be interesting to see who his next target will be.\"<ref name=\"WofS\"/>

Matt Conaway of [[AllMusic]] was mixed about the album, praising Canibus' delivery and battle rhymes for being attention-grabbing to the ears, but felt indifferent to the drum tracks conducted by the new producers, concluding that his \"vast potential remains largely unrealized thanks to bland production.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> ''[[NME]]'' also commented on the production, saying that outside \"The C-Quel\" and the title track, it feels monotonous afterwards, saying that, \"There's just not enough concepts or ideas on show - every song is a fist-fight to the death.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> Tony Green of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised the album's first half for being able to match the production with Canibus' angry-filled lyrics but felt that the aggression depletes later on, concluding that, \"Still, ''2000'' is a cut above his debut, making it the kind of second chance that you don't often get in the music biz.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/>

Christopher O'Connor of SonicNet felt that the album was wasted potential and only exhibited inner male rage, concluding that, \"It's ironic that for all of his intelligence, passion and obvious talent, Canibus chose to stoop to the caveman mentality so apparent on this release. 2000 B.C., indeed.\"<ref name=\"SonicNet\"/> [[Craig Seymour]], writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', criticized Canibus for crafting the album with anger-filled tracks and should utilize his talents to make better songs.<ref name=\"EW\"/> [[Jon Caramanica]] from ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' said that despite the album having the appropriate production, Canibus still spits disses like he's going to war and will continue doing so with bloody hands, concluding that, \"It's a hollow victory if there ever was one.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Caramanica|title=Cannibus '2000 B.C.'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ScEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA172|accessdate=July 31, 2015|date=August 2000|journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|publisher=[[Vibe Media Group|Vibe Media]]|issn=1070-4701|page=172}}</ref>

minor tweaks,safe,Chidgk1,"'''Climate communication''' or '''climate change communication''' is a field of [[environmental communication]]s and [[science communication]] focused on facilitating the communications of the effects of [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]]. Most climate communication focuses on bringing knowledge from the scientific consensus on the impact of climate change to a broader public.

The field of climate communication explores two main areas: the efficacy of existing communications strategies, and supporting the development of recommendations for improving that communication. Improving climate change communication has become the focus of several major research institutes, such as the [[Yale Program on Climate Change Communication]] and Climate Outreach in the UK, as well as major international organizations, such as the IPCC and [[UN Climate Change Secretariat]], and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s.

== History ==
In her Encyclopedia article in Oxford's Communications Research Encyclopedia, scholar Amy E. Chadwick describes Climate Change Communication as a new field emerging in the 1990s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://oxfordre.com/communication/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-22|title=Climate Change Communication|last=Chadwick|first=Amy E.|date=2017-09-26|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Communication|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-22|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> Early studies were connected to other environmental communications concerns such as exploring awareness and understanding of [[ozone depletion]].<ref name=\":2\" /> {{As of|2017|}}, most research in this field has been conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and Western European countries.<ref name=\":2\" />

== Major issues ==

=== Barriers to understanding ===
Because of the importance of the larger scale [[Climate change mitigation|public action required in addressing climate change]], a significant part of climate communications is focused on understanding barriers to public understanding and action on climate change. In particular, the evidence shows that the [[information deficit model]] of communication—where climate change communicators assume  \"if the public only knew more about the evidence they would act\"—doesn't work. Instead, [[argumentation theory]] indicates that different audiences need different kinds of persuasive argumentation and communication.

Additionally, [[Climate change denial|climate denialism]] by organizations such as the [[The Heartland Institute]] in the United States, introduces [[misinformation]] into public discourse and understanding.

There are several models for explaining why the public doesn't act once more informed. One of the theoretical models for this is the 5 Ds model created by [[Per Espen Stoknes|Per Epsten Stoknes]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2015/04/03/the-5-psychological-barriers-t.html|title=The 5 psychological barriers to climate action|last=Stoknes|first=Per Espen|date=2015-04-03|website=Boing Boing|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Stokes describes 5 major barriers to creating action from climate communication:

# '''Distance''' - many effects and impacts of climate change feel distant from individual lives
# '''Doom -''' when framed as a disaster, the message backfires, causing [[Eco-anxiety]]
# '''Dissonance''' - a disconnect between the problems (mainly the fossil fuel economy) and the things that people choose in their lives
# '''Denial''' -- psychological self defense to avoid becoming overwhelmed by fear or guilt
# '''iDentity''' -- disconnects created by social identities, such as [[Conservatism|conservative]] values, which are threatened by the changes that need to happen because of climate change.

=== Creating change ===
As of 2008, most of the environmental communications evidence for effecting individual or social change were focused on behavior changes around: [[Domestic energy consumption|household energy consumption]], [[Recycling|recycling behaviours]], changing transportation behavior and buying green products.<ref name=\":1\" /> At that time, there were few examples of [[multi-level communications]] strategies for effecting change.<ref name=\":1\" />

=== Audience Segmentation ===
{{Main|audience segmentation}}
Different parts of different populations respond differently to climate change communication. Academic researchers since 2013, has seen an increasing number of Audience segmentation studies to understand different tactics for reaching different parts of populations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hine|first=Donald W|last2=Reser|first2=Joseph P|last3=Morrison|first3=Mark|last4=Phillips|first4=Wendy J|last5=Nunn|first5=Patrick|last6=Cooksey|first6=Ray|date=July 2014|title=Audience segmentation and climate change communication: conceptual and methodological considerations: Audience segmentation and climate change communication|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/wcc.279|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=441–459|doi=10.1002/wcc.279}}</ref> Major segmentation studies include:

=== Changing Rhetoric ===
A significant part of the research and public advocacy conversations about climate change have focused on the effectiveness of different terms used to describe \"global warming\".

==== History of &quot;Global Warming&quot; ====
{{Excerpt|Global_warming|Terminology}}

=== Health ===
{{Main|Climate change and health}}Climate change exacerbates a number of existing public health issues, such as [[mosquito-borne disease]], and introduce new public health concerns related to changing climate, such as increase in health concerns after natural disasters or increases in [[heat illness]]es. Thus the field of [[health communication]] has long acknowledged the importance of treating climate change as a public health issue, requiring broad population behavior changes that allow societal [[climate change adaptation]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Maibach|first=Edward W.|last2=Roser-Renouf|first2=Connie|last3=Leiserowitz|first3=Anthony|date=November 2008|title=Communication and Marketing As Climate Change–Intervention Assets|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749379708006818|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|language=en|volume=35|issue=5|pages=488–500|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.016}}</ref> A December 2008 article in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] recommended using two broad sets of tools to effect this change: communication and [[social marketing]].<ref name=\":0\" />

=== Media coverage ===
{{Main|Media coverage of global warming}}
The effect of mass media and journalism on the public's attitudes towards climate change has been a significant part of communications studies. In particular, scholars have looked at how media's tendency to cover climate change changes regionally, with different audiences (i.e. [[Fox News]]'s dismissive coverage of climate change news) and the tendency of newsrooms to cover climate change as a issue of uncertainty or debate, in order to give a sense of balance.<ref name=\":2\" /> 

=== Popular culture ===
{{Main|Global warming in popular culture}}
Further research has explored how popular media, like the film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' and popular documentary [[An Inconvenient Truth]] change public perceptions of climate change.<ref name=\":2\" />

== Effective climate communication ==
Effective climate communications require audience and contextual awareness. Different organizations have published guides and frameworks based on experience in climate communications. This section documents those various guidelines.

=== By experts ===
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] published a handbook of guidance for IPCC authors about effective climate communication. It is based on extensive social studies research exploring the impact of different tactics for climate communication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climateoutreach.org/resources/ipcc-communications-handbook/|title=Communications Handbook for IPCC scientists|last=|first=|date=January 30, 2018|website=Climate Outreach|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The guidelines focus on six main principles:

# Be a confident communicator 
# Talk about the real world, not abstract idea 
# Connect with what matters to your audience 
# Tell a human story 
# Lead  with what you know 
# Use the most effective visual communication

=== Visuals ===
Climate Visuals a nonprofit, publishes a set of guidelines based on evidence for climate communications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatevisuals.org/evidence-behind-climate-visuals|title=The evidence behind Climate Visuals|website=Climate Visuals|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> They recommend that visual communication include:

# Show real people 
# Tell new stories 
# Show climate change causes at scale 
# Show emotionally powerful impacts 
# Understand your audience 
# Show local (serious) impacts 
# Be careful with protest imagery.

=== Sustainable development ===
The impacts of climate change are exacerbated in low- and middle income countries; higher levels of poverty, less access to technologies, and less education, means that this audience needs different information. The [[Paris Agreement]] and [[IPCC]] both acknowledge the importance of [[sustainable development]] in addressing these differences. Non profit, [[Climate and Development Knowledge Network]] published a set of lessons learned and guidelines based on their experience communicating climate change in Latin America, Asia and Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-communicating-climate-change-a-practitioners-guide/|title=GUIDE: Communicating climate change - A practitioner's guide|website=Climate and Development Knowledge Network|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>

== Important organizations ==
Major research centers in climate communication include:

* [[Yale Program on Climate Change Communication]]
* [[Center for Climate Change Communication]] at [[George Mason University]]

Climate Visuals a nonprofit, publishes a set of guidelines based on evidence for climate communications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatevisuals.org/evidence-behind-climate-visuals|title=The evidence behind Climate Visuals|website=Climate Visuals|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> They recommend that visual communication include:

# Show real people 
# Tell new stories 
# Show climate change causes at scale 
# Show emotionally powerful impacts 
# Understand your audience 
# Show local (serious) impacts 
# Be careful with protest imagery.

=== Sustainable development ===
The impacts of climate change are exacerbated in low- and middle income countries; higher levels of poverty, less access to technologies, and less education, means that this audience needs different information. The [[Paris Agreement]] and [[IPCC]] both acknowledge the importance of [[sustainable development]] in addressing these differences. Non profit, [[Climate and Development Knowledge Network]] published a set of lessons learned and guidelines based on their experience communicating climate change in Latin America, Asia and Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-communicating-climate-change-a-practitioners-guide/|title=GUIDE: Communicating climate change - A practitioner's guide|website=Climate and Development Knowledge Network|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>

Major research centers in climate communication include:

* [[Yale Program on Climate Change Communication]]
* [[Center for Climate Change Communication]] at [[George Mason University]]

'''Calistrat Hogaș''' (born '''Calistrat Dumitriu'''; April 19, 1848 – August 28, 1917) was a Moldavian, later Romanian prose writer. The son of a [[Tecuci]] priest, he studied at [[Iași University]] before beginning an over four-decade career as a high school teacher, often at [[Piatra Neamț]]. Meanwhile, he made several false starts as a writer before finding a suitable genre, namely stories drawn from his mountain rambles that appeared starting in 1907. He did not manage to collect his works during his lifetime, but these appeared to great success in 1921.

==Biography==

===Origins and literary career===
Born in [[Tecuci]], his parents were Gheorghe Dumitriu, a [[Romanian Orthodox]] [[archpriest]], and his wife Mărioara (''née'' Stanciu),<ref name=\"sasu\"/> the daughter of a ''[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|serdar]]'' from [[Pechea]], [[Galați County]]. He was the first or second of eight children, and various birthdates between 1847 and 1852 have been suggested, but April 19, 1848 appears likeliest.<ref>Hogaș, p. ix</ref> His adopted surname was a nickname of his grandfather's that was assigned to him in primary school as a way to distinguish him from other pupils named Dumitriu. After completing the primary grades in his native town, he attended middle and high school at ''[[Academia Mihăileană]]'' and at the [[National College (Iași)|National College]] in [[Iași]] from 1859 to 1867.<ref name=\"sasu\"/> [[Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol]], [[Vasile Conta]], [[Alexandru Lambrior]], [[Constantin Dimitrescu-Iași]] and [[George Panu]] were all classmates, and he befriended the last three.<ref>Hogaș, p. xi</ref> From 1867 to 1869, he attended the literature faculty of [[Iași University]].<ref name=\"sasu\"/> Panu and Lambrior remained university classmates, and he was noticed as a good student during high school by [[Titu Maiorescu]], with whom he also came in touch during his university years. Nevertheless, he did not join the ''[[Junimea]]'' society of which the latter was president, and which at the time was a sure path to advancement of one's literary reputation. From 1869, he worked as a teacher of Romanian language and literature at the new gymnasium in [[Piatra Neamț]], where he was also director and handled all the humanities courses.<ref name=\"o109\">Ornea, p. 109</ref> In January 1870, he married Elena Gheorghiu, the daughter of a Piatra Neamț priest; the couple had eight children.<ref>Octavian Botez, Jana Balacciu, ''Calistrat Hogaș: amintiri și articole critice'', p. 177. Bucharest: Editura Eminescu, 1976</ref> A lover of Greek and Roman culture, he gave them names such as Cleopatra, Cornelia, Sidonia and Aețiu.<ref>Hogaș, p. xiii</ref> In 1878, he left Piatra Neamț for a period of three years, teaching first at the gymnasium in Tecuci and then at a normal school in Iași, and then lived in the former town from 1881 to 1885.<ref>Hogaș, p. xiv</ref> He subsequently taught in Tecuci, [[Alexandria, Romania|Alexandria]] and [[Roman, Romania|Roman]];<ref name=\"sasu\"/> during this period, from the mid-1880s to the late 1890s, he published only sporadically. His reluctance to write was deepened by the accidental death of his 18-year-old daughter in 1894.<ref>Hogaș, p. xx</ref> From 1898, he was a teacher at the [[Costache Negruzzi National College|Boarding High School]] in Iași.<ref name=\"sasu\"/>

His literary debut consisted of verses that appeared in the Piatra Neamț newspaper ''Corespondența provincială'' in 1874. In the same town, he founded a newspaper, ''Situațiunea'', that briefly appeared in 1878.<ref name=\"sasu\"/> While living there, he began climbing the local mountains.<ref name=\"o109\"/> Between 1881 and 1882, he was a school inspector in [[Neamț County]], coming to know [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] in this capacity.<ref name=\"sasu\"/> From his return to Piatra Neamț in 1881 until 1885, Hogaș contributed to ''Asachi'' magazine; his first contributions to the ''Amintiri din o călătorie'' series appeared there from 1882 to 1884, but they had no resonance with critics.<ref name=\"sasu\"/><ref name=\"o109\"/> Invited to submit poetry to a [[Bucharest]] magazine, he refused, probably aware of their antiquated style.<ref name=\"o109\"/> He continued the ''Amintiri'' series in Xenopol's magazine ''Arhiva'' from 1893 to 1902;<ref name=\"sasu\"/> these contributions also went unnoticed, as the magazine was not taken seriously.<ref name=\"o109\"/>

The 1906 establishment of ''[[Viața Românească]]'', the formation of a group surrounding the magazine and his resulting friendship with [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] were crucial to his career; his ''În munții Neamțului'' and other travel notes appeared there from 1907 to 1912.<ref name=\"sasu\"/> He cut an odd and colorful picture at Iași: a large man, dressed unusually, wearing a woolen jacket in all seasons, with a huge overcoat and an equally sizable hat, wearing thick boots in winter and custom made sandals in summer, he hustled between the three high schools where he taught, after a breakfast consisting of a chunk of meat roasted over coals, seasoned with a handful of onions and washed down with a pot of coffee. His ''Viața Românească'' colleagues respected Hogaș and treated him as a friend, even though he was older than all of them; they asked his advice and unanimously admired his contributions. Caragiale considered him a great writer and spoke glowingly of his writings.<ref name=\"o110\"/>

===Publication challenges and legacy===
He decided to collect his writings in book form in 1912, the year he retired from teaching. Hogaș insisted on making the manuscript corrections himself, but the copies were destroyed because they contained a devastating number of typographical errors; the new edition, from 1914, was almost entirely destroyed in a fire that burned down the warehouse of ''Viața Românească''.<ref name=\"sasu\"/><ref name=\"o110\"/> He was rejected for a prize from the [[Romanian Academy]], most likely due to a report drawn up by [[Ioan D. Caragiani]].<ref name=\"sasu\"/> Nostalgic for his teaching days, Hogaș found his strength diminished and compared his retirement to [[Ovid]]'s exile in [[Constanța|Tomis]].<ref name=\"h26\"/> He withdrew to Piatra Neamț in his last years and did not live to see his book appear, due to the ongoing World War I; he died at Roman.<ref name=\"sasu\"/> Initially interred there, he was later exhumed, the coffin transported on an ox-drawn cart covered in pine branches, and reburied at Piatra Neamț, in accordance with his wishes.<ref name=\"h26\">Hogaș, p. xxvi</ref> It was only in 1921 that his collected works appeared: covering two volumes, ''Amintiri dintr-o călătorie'' and ''În munții Neamțului'', the second was prefaced by [[Mihail Sadoveanu]],<ref name=\"sasu\"/> a devoted admirer.

While [[George Călinescu]] considered him merely \"a talented, one-dimensional dilettante\", other critics, including Ibrăileanu, [[Tudor Vianu]], [[Vladimir Streinu]] (who edited his works between 1944 and 1947), [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Constantin Ciopraga]] (who put out another edition in 1956), [[Al.

They commented on his literary discourse, his romanticism, evocation of landscapes and classical allusions.

'''Mike Singleton''' (21 February 1951&nbsp;– 10 October 2012) was a British [[video game designer]] who wrote various well-regarded titles for the [[ZX Spectrum]] during the 1980s.  His titles include ''[[The Lords of Midnight]]'', ''[[Doomdark's Revenge]]'', ''[[Dark Sceptre]]'', ''[[War in Middle Earth (1988 video game)|War in Middle Earth]]'' and ''[[Midwinter (video game)|Midwinter]]''.  Before developing video games, Singleton was an English teacher in [[Ellesmere Port]], Cheshire, England.

==Early work==
Singleton originally started programming in the late 1970s, and writing ''Computer Race'', a horse racing game he designed for a betting shop on the [[Commodore PET]].<ref name=crash14>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/14/singletn.htm |title=I BET TOLKIEN DID THE SAME |work=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |date=March 1985 |issue=14}}</ref>  Moving on from this, he began working on [[arcade game]]s for the Pet, working with PetSoft, where he wrote ''Space Ace'' entirely in [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] [[machine code]].  The game broke sales records of the day by selling three hundred copies.<ref name=crash41>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/41/maelstrm.htm |title=MAELSTROM IN A TEACUP |work=Crash |date=June 1987 |issue=41}}</ref>

Singleton's association with PetSoft turned out to be short-lived, as PetSoft, who had been due to enter into a contract with [[Sinclair Research Ltd.|Sinclair Research]] in [[Cambridge]] to write software for the new [[Sinclair ZX80|ZX80]], lost out on the deal to [[Psion (computers)|Psion]].  Singleton contacted British inventor and entrepreneur [[Clive Sinclair]] and was asked to send his games along.<ref name=crash41 />  He was then asked to visit the site in Cambridge, and invited to work on software for their brand new [[Sinclair ZX81|ZX81]] micro.<ref name=crash14 />

Singleton used this as the platform for his ''GamesPack1'' project. ''GamesPack1'' was a series of games, each fitting into just 1 [[kilobyte]] of memory.  It was one of the first commercial software programs written for the ZX81, and something of a runaway success, selling a massive 90,000 copies, earning Singleton [[Pound sterling|£]]6,000 for his efforts,<ref name=crash41 /> having taken him just two weeks over the Christmas holidays to complete.<ref name=crash14 />

==Golden age of the home microcomputer==
Whilst the arcade game writing business was making him a living, Singleton, who retired from teaching completely in 1982 to become a full-time freelance [[video game designer|games designer]], was always an old school war gamer at heart,<ref name=sua85>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/sinclair-user-magazine-annual-1985/SinclairUser-Annual1985#page/n37/mode/2up |title=Chapter 4: Hit Squad |work=The 1985 Sinclair User Annual |publisher=[[Sinclair User]] |date=1985 |pages=39–42}}</ref> hooked from an early age on war [[board game]]s and [[Play-by-mail game|play-by-mail]] (PBM) strategy gaming, working for a time on ''Seventh Empire'', a PBM game he put together for ''[[Computer and Video Games (magazine)|Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine (''C&VG''),<ref name=sua85 /> which eventually led to [[Beyond Software]] when ''C&VG'' editor Terry Pratt moved to run Beyond.<ref name=crash14 />

In March 1984, Singleton's spy-themed board game, ''Treachery'', which had its complicated game logic controlled by a computer program, was featured in ''C&VG'', with a type-in listing for the Spectrum, together with a keyboard overlay (a common feature of his games), centre-spread board and a set of counters.  The game was so popular among the readers that the editor asked for conversions for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[BBC Micro]] to be produced, and each of them featured in ''C&VG'''s 1985 yearbook.

It was from Beyond that Singleton, who remained freelance, was by September 1983 being pressed for more programs, and having progressed to the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, he wrote what are widely regarded as some of the best strategy adventure games ever to be seen on those early home microcomputers,<ref name=\"PlanSinc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/industry/programmers/mikesingleton.htm |title=Planet Sinclair: The Sinclair Industry: Programmers: Mike Singleton |website=Nvg.ntnu.no |date= |accessdate=2016-06-27}}</ref> the ''Midnight'' series: ''[[Lords of Midnight]]'' (released in July 1984) and ''[[Doomdark's Revenge]]'', which were originally intended to form the first two episodes in a trilogy of which, the final episode, ''[[Eye of the Moon]]'', never came about. Each of the two games played out on a scale never seen before back in the mid-eighties, at a time when many games were boasting 50 or even 100 locations, ''Lords of Midnight'''s groundbreaking gameplay featured over 4,000 locations, and ''Doomdark's Revenge'', 6,000, plus well in excess of 100 player controllable characters.  Had ''Eye of the Moon'' come to fruition, it was to have had around 24,000 locations, in a map featuring twelve distinct regions, each with a local sub-quest completely separate from the main objective of the game.<ref name=crash41 />

Moving on from the ''Midnight'' series, Singleton worked on several games of a more arcade-like nature, the first of which, ''[[Throne of Fire]]'',<ref name=\"PlanSinc\" /> a side viewed live action game, featured a multiplayer option where each player used the same computer to explore simultaneously, each trying to complete a set of objectives which lead to the overall completion of the game. ''[[Dark Sceptre]]'',<ref name=\"PlanSinc\" /> released later the same year, was also in essence a sideways viewed live action game, but returned to a more adventure-like feel, with a long, drawn out challenge awaiting the player who would need to build up their forces to consolidate their position before seizing on the opportunity to actually complete the game.

Two years later, ''[[War in Middle-earth]]'',<ref name=\"PlanSinc\" /> whilst essentially an [[adventure game]] on a similar scale to the ''Midnight'' series, represented a switch from the adventure to an action philosophy, requiring the player to interact with the characters under their control directly, moving them individually in each of the battles,<ref name=crash41 /> giving the game much more of an arcade/adventure feel.

==Later work==
In the late 1980s, Singleton moved onto the [[16-bit]] machines that were making an appearance, and worked on the classic ''[[Midwinter (video game)|Midwinter]]'' trilogy, also producing another work in the ''Lords of Midnight'' series in 1995, [[Lords of Midnight: The Citadel]].

In the 21st century, Singleton continued working in games design, making him one of a few developers to have made the transition to more modern consoles from the early days of home computing. Singleton worked for [[Midas Interactive]] and [[LucasArts]] on several games for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation]] consoles, such as the action games ''[[HyperSonic Xtreme]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb]]''. Singleton worked on the strategy game ''[[Wrath Unleashed]]'', with his latest productions being ''[[Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows]]'', a continuation of the 80s arcade classic ''[[Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]]'' series of games, and ''[[Race Driver: Grid]]'', a racing game developed by [[Codemasters]].<ref>{{moby developer|id=17924|name=Singleton's profile}}</ref> At the time of his death after suffering from cancer,<ref>{{Citation | title = RIP Mike Singleton, the RPG visionary who revolutionised the genre | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/oct/16/mike-singleton-rpg-visionary-games | publisher = theguardian.com | last = Stuart | first = Keith | date = 16 October 2012 | accessdate = 30 November 2019}}</ref> Singleton was working on an iPhone port of ''Lords of Midnight''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icemark.com/blog/archives/2012/10/16/night-has-fallen/ |title=Night has fallen...|last=Wild|first=Jon|website=Icemark.com|date=16 October 2012}}</ref>

'''Climate communication''' or '''climate change communication''' is a field of [[environmental communication]]s and [[science communication]] focused on facilitating the communications of the effects of [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]]. Most climate communication focuses on bringing knowledge from the scientific consensus on the impact of climate change to a broader public.

The field of climate communication explores two main areas: the efficacy of existing communications strategies, and supporting the development of recommendations for improving that communication. Improving climate change communication has become the focus of several major research institutes, such as the [[Yale Program on Climate Change Communication]] and Climate Outreach in the UK, as well as major international organizations, such as the IPCC and [[UN Climate Change Secretariat]], and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s.

== History ==
In her encyclopedia article in Oxford's Communications Research Encyclopedia, scholar Amy E. Chadwick describes Climate Change Communication as a new field emerging in the 1990s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://oxfordre.com/communication/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-22|title=Climate Change Communication|last=Chadwick|first=Amy E.|date=2017-09-26|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Communication|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001|doi-broken-date=2020-04-13|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> Early studies were connected to other environmental communications concerns such as exploring awareness and understanding of [[ozone depletion]].<ref name=\":2\" /> {{As of|2017|}}, most research in this field has been conducted in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Western European countries.<ref name=\":2\" />

== Major issues ==

=== Barriers to understanding ===
Because of the importance of the larger scale [[Climate change mitigation|public action required in addressing climate change]], a significant part of climate communications is focused on understanding barriers to public understanding and action on climate change. In particular, the evidence shows that the [[information deficit model]] of communication—where climate change communicators assume  \"if the public only knew more about the evidence they would act\"—doesn't work. Instead, [[argumentation theory]] indicates that different audiences need different kinds of persuasive argumentation and communication.

Additionally, [[Climate change denial|climate denialism]] by organizations such as the [[The Heartland Institute]] in the United States, introduces [[misinformation]] into public discourse and understanding.

There are several models for explaining why the public doesn't act once more informed. One of the theoretical models for this is the 5 Ds model created by [[Per Espen Stoknes|Per Epsten Stoknes]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2015/04/03/the-5-psychological-barriers-t.html|title=The 5 psychological barriers to climate action|last=Stoknes|first=Per Espen|date=2015-04-03|website=Boing Boing|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Stokes describes 5 major barriers to creating action from climate communication:

# '''Distance''' - many effects and impacts of climate change feel distant from individual lives
# '''Doom -''' when framed as a disaster, the message backfires, causing [[Eco-anxiety]]
# '''Dissonance''' - a disconnect between the problems (mainly the fossil fuel economy) and the things that people choose in their lives
# '''Denial''' -- psychological self defense to avoid becoming overwhelmed by fear or guilt
# '''iDentity''' -- disconnects created by social identities, such as [[Conservatism|conservative]] values, which are threatened by the changes that need to happen because of climate change.

=== Creating change ===
As of 2008, most of the environmental communications evidence for effecting individual or social change were focused on behavior changes around: [[Domestic energy consumption|household energy consumption]], [[Recycling|recycling behaviours]], changing transportation behavior and buying green products.<ref name=\":1\" /> At that time, there were few examples of [[multi-level communications]] strategies for effecting change.<ref name=\":1\" />

=== Audience Segmentation ===

Different parts of different populations respond differently to climate change communication. Academic research since 2013 has seen an increasing number of [[audience segmentation]] studies, to understand different tactics for reaching different parts of populations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hine|first=Donald W|last2=Reser|first2=Joseph P|last3=Morrison|first3=Mark|last4=Phillips|first4=Wendy J|last5=Nunn|first5=Patrick|last6=Cooksey|first6=Ray|date=July 2014|title=Audience segmentation and climate change communication: conceptual and methodological considerations: Audience segmentation and climate change communication|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change|volume=5|issue=4|pages=441–459|doi=10.1002/wcc.279}}</ref> Major segmentation studies include:

=== Changing Rhetoric ===
A significant part of the research and public advocacy conversations about climate change have focused on the effectiveness of different terms used to describe \"global warming\".

==== History of &quot;Global Warming&quot; ====
{{Excerpt|Global_warming|Terminology}}

=== Health ===
{{Main|Climate change and health}}Climate change exacerbates a number of existing public health issues, such as [[mosquito-borne disease]], and introduces new public health concerns related to changing climate, such as increase in health concerns after natural disasters or increases in [[heat illness]]es. Thus the field of [[health communication]] has long acknowledged the importance of treating climate change as a public health issue, requiring broad population behavior changes that allow societal [[climate change adaptation]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Maibach|first=Edward W.|last2=Roser-Renouf|first2=Connie|last3=Leiserowitz|first3=Anthony|date=November 2008|title=Communication and Marketing As Climate Change–Intervention Assets|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|language=en|volume=35|issue=5|pages=488–500|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.016|pmid=18929975}}</ref> A December 2008 article in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] recommended using two broad sets of tools to effect this change: communication and [[social marketing]].<ref name=\":0\" />

=== Media coverage ===
{{Main|Media coverage of global warming}}
The effect of mass media and journalism on the public's attitudes towards climate change has been a significant part of communications studies. In particular, scholars have looked at how the media's tendency to cover climate change in different cultural contexts, with different audiences or political positions (for example [[Fox News]]'s dismissive coverage of climate change news), and the tendency of newsrooms to cover climate change as a issue of uncertainty or debate, in order to give a sense of balance.<ref name=\":2\" /> 

=== Popular culture ===
{{Main|Global warming in popular culture}}
Further research has explored how popular media, like the film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' and popular documentary [[An Inconvenient Truth]] change public perceptions of climate change.<ref name=\":2\" />

== Effective climate communication ==
Effective climate communications require audience and contextual awareness. Different organizations have published guides and frameworks based on experience in climate communications. This section documents those various guidelines.

=== By experts ===
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] published a handbook of guidance for IPCC authors about effective climate communication. It is based on extensive social studies research exploring the impact of different tactics for climate communication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climateoutreach.org/resources/ipcc-communications-handbook/|title=Communications Handbook for IPCC scientists|last=|first=|date=January 30, 2018|website=Climate Outreach|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The guidelines focus on six main principles:

# Be a confident communicator 
# Talk about the real world, not abstract ideas
# Connect with what matters to your audience 
# Tell a human story 
# Lead  with what you know 
# Use the most effective visual communication

=== Visuals ===
Climate Visuals a nonprofit, publishes a set of guidelines based on evidence for climate communications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatevisuals.org/evidence-behind-climate-visuals|title=The evidence behind Climate Visuals|website=Climate Visuals|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> They recommend that visual communications include:

# Show real people 
# Tell new stories 
# Show climate change causes at scale 
# Show emotionally powerful impacts 
# Understand your audience 
# Show local (serious) impacts 
# Be careful with protest imagery.

=== Sustainable development ===
The impacts of climate change are exacerbated in low- and middle income countries; higher levels of poverty, less access to technologies, and less education, means that this audience needs different information. The [[Paris Agreement]] and [[IPCC]] both acknowledge the importance of [[sustainable development]] in addressing these differences. Non profit, [[Climate and Development Knowledge Network]] published a set of [[lessons learned]] and guidelines based on their experience communicating climate change in Latin America, Asia and Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-communicating-climate-change-a-practitioners-guide/|title=GUIDE: Communicating climate change - A practitioner's guide|website=Climate and Development Knowledge Network|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>

== Important organizations ==
Major research centers in climate communication include:

* [[Yale Program on Climate Change Communication]]
* [[Center for Climate Change Communication]] at [[George Mason University]]

He was one of a few West Pakistan Assembly members who were very much vocal against military dictator General [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] on assembly floor.

Toba Tek Singh was the only city other than Karachi where Fatima Jinnah's Muslim League won a seat, and Hamza became the member of parliament. Hamza used to held public protests across the country during the [[1968 movement in Pakistan|1968 Movement in Pakistan]] against military regime of Ayub Khan and was taken into custody in numerous occasions. President Ayub Khan resigned in the face of growing public protests, and was succeeded by General Yahya Khan.

Hamza was amongst the prominent leaders of [[Pakistan National Alliance]] (PNA), a nine party coalition against the ruling party of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]. The protests of 1977 called for overthrow, [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia ul Haq]] became Chief Marshal Law Administrator after declaring Martial Law in country in 1978.

Hamza’s was the only voice of opposition in the parliament the day when 295-C was passed immediately. During his speech in 1986, Hamza argued that the Islamic texts being cited by those advocating for the death penalty needed to be comprehensively reviewed by religious scholars before any change in the law could be passed. He claimed parliament was being irresponsible by avoiding a deeper debate on the issue. “I have a firm opinion,” said Hamza, “you cannot run the country on selective justice. What is the purpose of the law if it’s destructive for the society? Our people lack depth, they are unreasonably emotional about religion, so I knew that the law will be misused - that’s why I am opposing.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/Asia_Bibi|title=Asia Bibi: Pakistan's notorious case|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

The '''Kübler-Ross model''', or the '''five stages of grief''', postulates a series of emotions experienced by terminally ill patients prior to [[death]], or people who have lost a loved one, wherein the five stages are: [[denial]], [[anger]], bargaining, [[Depression (mood)|depression]],  and [[acceptance]]. Although commonly referenced in popular media, the existence of these stages has not been demonstrated and the model is not considered helpful in explaining the grieving process.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Bonanno2009\" />

The model was first introduced by Swiss-American psychiatrist [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] in her 1969 book ''[[On Death and Dying]]'', and was inspired by her work with [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] patients.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html |title= Milestones |date=August 30, 2004 | work=TIME | first=Sarah M. | last=Broom | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> Motivated by the lack of instruction in medical schools on the subject of death and dying, Kübler-Ross examined death and those faced with it at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine|medical school]].

The stages, popularly known by the acronym '''DABDA''', include:<ref name=\"Santrock\">{{cite book |title=A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development | vauthors = Santrock JW |year= 2007 |publisher= [[McGraw-Hill]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-07-338264-7 |page= |pages= |url= |access-date=}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}}</ref>
#[[Denial]] – The first reaction is denial. In this stage, individuals believe the diagnosis is somehow mistaken, and cling to a false, preferable reality.
#[[Anger]] – When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated, especially at proximate individuals. Certain psychological responses of a person undergoing this phase would be: \"Why me? It's not fair!\"; \"How can this happen to me?\"; \"Who is to blame?\"; \"Why would this happen?\".
#[[Bargaining]] – The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. People facing less serious trauma can bargain or seek compromise. Examples include the terminally ill person who \"negotiates with God\" to attend a daughter's wedding, an attempt to bargain for more time to live in exchange for a reformed lifestyle or a phrase such as \"If I could trade their life for mine\".
#[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] – \"I'm so sad, why bother with anything?\"; \"I'm going to die soon, so what's the point?\"; \"I miss my loved one; why go on?\"<br />During the fourth stage, the individual despairs at the recognition of their mortality. In this state, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time mournful and sullen.
#[[Acceptance]] – \"It's going to be okay.\"; \"I can't fight it; I may as well prepare for it.\"<br /> In this last stage, individuals embrace mortality or inevitable future, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event. People dying may precede the survivors in this state, which typically comes with a calm, retrospective view for the individual, and a stable condition of emotions.

In a book co-authored with [[David_Kessler_(writer)|David Kessler]] and published posthumously, Kübler-Ross expanded her model to include any form of personal loss, such as the death of a loved one, the loss of a job or income, major [[Social rejection|rejection]], the end of a relationship or [[divorce]], [[drug addiction]], [[incarceration]], the onset of a [[disease]] or an [[infertility]] diagnosis, and even minor losses, such as a loss of insurance coverage.<ref name=GriefGrieving>{{Cite book |title=On grief & grieving : finding the meaning of grief through the five stages of loss |last=Kübler-Ross |first=Elisabeth |date=2014 |publisher=Scribner |last2=Kessler |first2=David | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=9781476775555 |location=New York |oclc=863077888}}</ref> Kessler has also proposed \"Meaning\" as a sixth stage of grief.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H920DwAAQBAJ |title = Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief|isbn = 9781501192739|last1 = Kessler|first1 = David|date = 5 November 2019}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

The PM CARES fund is different from the [[Prime Minister's National Relief Fund]] (PMNRF).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/pms-funds/|title=PM National Relief Fund {{!}} Prime Minister of India|website=www.pmindia.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref> Following the creation of the fund opposition members raised a lot of queries as to why a separate fund was needed, when it was registered, under which act and why it did not contain any members of civil society or opposition as part of the trust.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-questions-setting-up-of-pm-cares-fund-to-deal-with-coronavirus/article31210904.ece|title=Congress questions setting up of PM CARES Fund to deal with coronavirus|date=2020-03-30|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-03-31|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/transfer-all-money-under-pm-cares-to-pmnrf-sonia-gandhi/articleshow/75036589.cms|title=Transfer all money under PM-Cares to PMNRF: Sonia Gandhi|date=2020-04-07|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>

But the Supreme Court of India later dismissed a PIL(Public Interest Litigation) petition filed for questioning the legality of the constitution of PM CARES Fund for COVID-19 by saying the petition as misconceived.

== Scam ==

Immediately after the fund was created a number of fake accounts popped up. While the original [[Unified Payments Interface|UPI]] accounts were pmcares@sbi and pmcares@iob, [[Delhi Police]] booked an individual for creating a UPI account removing the 's' called pmcare@sbi, intended to scam people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/delhi-police-books-fraudsters-for-making-fake-sbi-account-of-pm-s-covid-19-relief-fund-1661272-2020-03-30|title=Delhi Police books fraudsters for making fake SBI account of PM's Covid-19 Relief Fund|last=Ojha|first=Arvind|date=30 March 2020|website=India Today|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

The PM CARES fund is different from the [[Prime Minister's National Relief Fund]] (PMNRF).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/pms-funds/|title=PM National Relief Fund {{!}} Prime Minister of India|website=www.pmindia.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref> Following the creation of the fund opposition members raised a lot of queries as to why a separate fund was needed, when it was registered, under which act and why it did not contain any members of civil society or opposition as part of the trust.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-questions-setting-up-of-pm-cares-fund-to-deal-with-coronavirus/article31210904.ece|title=Congress questions setting up of PM CARES Fund to deal with coronavirus|date=2020-03-30|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-03-31|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/transfer-all-money-under-pm-cares-to-pmnrf-sonia-gandhi/articleshow/75036589.cms|title=Transfer all money under PM-Cares to PMNRF: Sonia Gandhi|date=2020-04-07|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>

But the Supreme Court of India later dismissed a PIL(Public Interest Litigation) petition filed for questioning the legality of the constitution of PM CARES Fund for COVID-19 by saying the petition as misconceived.

== Scam ==

Immediately after the fund was created a number of fake accounts popped up. While the original [[Unified Payments Interface|UPI]] accounts were pmcares@sbi and pmcares@iob, [[Delhi Police]] booked an individual for creating a UPI account removing the 's' called pmcare@sbi, intended to scam people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/delhi-police-books-fraudsters-for-making-fake-sbi-account-of-pm-s-covid-19-relief-fund-1661272-2020-03-30|title=Delhi Police books fraudsters for making fake SBI account of PM's Covid-19 Relief Fund|last=Ojha|first=Arvind|date=30 March 2020|website=India Today|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

'''''Dasein''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdaːzaɪn}}) is a [[German language|German]] word that means \"being there\" or \"presence\" (German: ''[[wikt:da#German|da]]'' \"there\"; ''[[wikt:sein#German|sein]]'' \"being\"), and is often translated into English with the word \"existence\". It is a fundamental concept in the [[existential philosophy]] of [[Martin Heidegger]], particularly in his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' ''[[Being and Time]]''. Heidegger uses the expression ''Dasein'' to refer to the experience of [[being]] that is peculiar to human beings. Thus it is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as [[person]]hood, [[Death|mortality]] and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself.

==Heidegger's re-interpretation==
In German, ''Dasein'' is the vernacular term for \"existence\", as in \"I am pleased with my existence\" (''Ich bin mit meinem Dasein zufrieden''). The term has been used by several philosophers before Heidegger, most notably [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], with the meaning of human \"existence\" or \"presence\". It is derived from ''da-sein'', which literally means ''being-there/there-being''<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\">J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 70</ref>—though Heidegger was adamant that this was an inappropriate translation of ''Dasein''.<ref>[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus, H. L.]], ''Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time'' ([[Cambridge, MA]]: [[MIT Press]], 1990).</ref>
Dasein for Heidegger can be a way of being involved with and caring for the immediate world in which one lives, while always remaining aware of the contingent element of that involvement, of the priority of the world to the self, and of the evolving nature of the self itself.<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\"/>

The opposite of this authentic self is everyday and inauthentic Dasein, the forfeiture of one's individual meaning, destiny and lifespan, in favour of an (escapist) immersion in the public everyday world—the anonymous, identical world of [[das Man|the They]] and the Them.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 64-81</ref>

In harmony with [[Nietzsche]]'s critique of the [[subject (philosophy)#Nietzsche's critique of the subject|subject]], as something definable in terms of consciousness,  Heidegger distinguished Dasein from everyday consciousness in order to emphasize the critical importance \"Being\" has for our understanding and interpretation of the world, and so on.

<blockquote>
\"This entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term “Dasein”\" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.27).<ref name=\"Heidegger, M. 1962\">Heidegger, M. (1962). ''[[Being and Time]]'', Translated by [[John Macquarrie]] & [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]]. London: S.C.M. Press.</ref>

\"[Dasein is] that entity which in its Being has this very Being as an issue…\" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.68).<ref name=\"Heidegger, M. 1962\"/>
</blockquote>

Heidegger sought to use the concept of ''Dasein'' to uncover the primal nature of \"[[Being]]\" (''Sein''), agreeing with Nietzsche and [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]]<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 48</ref> that ''Dasein'' is always a being engaged in the world: neither a subject, nor the objective world alone, but the coherence of [[Being-in-the-world]]. This ontological basis of Heidegger's work thus opposes the Cartesian \"abstract agent\" in favour of practical engagement with one's environment.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 61</ref> Dasein is revealed by projection into, and engagement with, a personal world<ref>H. Phillipse, ''Heidegger's Philosophy of Being'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9y2rHPCOgsC&pg=PA220 p. 220].</ref>{{rp|220}}—a never-ending process of involvement with the world as mediated through the projects of the self.<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\"/>

Heidegger considered that language, everyday curiosity, [[logical system]]s, and common beliefs obscure ''Dasein's'' nature from itself.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 69-70</ref>  [[bad faith (existentialism)|Authentic choice]] means turning away from the collective world of Them, to face ''Dasein'', one's individuality, one's own limited life-span, one's own being.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 81-9</ref> Heidegger thus intended the concept of ''Dasein'' to provide a stepping stone in the questioning of what it means to ''be''—to have one's own being, one's own death, one's own truth.<ref>E. Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 96</ref>

Heidegger also saw the question of ''Dasein'' as extending beyond the realms disclosed by positive science or in the history of [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysics]].  “Scientific research is not the only manner of Being which this entity can have, nor is it the one which lies closest. Moreover, Dasein itself has a special distinctiveness as compared with other entities; [...] it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it.”<ref>Heidegger, Martin. \"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\" ''Being and Time'' / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 32</ref> ''[[Being and Time]]'' stressed the ontological difference between entities and the being ''of'' entities: “Being is always the Being of an entity.”<ref>Heidegger, Martin. \"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\" ''Being and Time'' / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 29.</ref> Establishing this difference is the general motif running through ''Being and Time''.

Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, arguing that for Heidegger \"''Dasein''\" denoted a structured awareness or an institutional \"way of life\".<ref>See John Haugeland's article [http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/haugeland/Reading+Brandom+Reading+Heidegger.pdf \"Reading Brandom Reading Heidegger\"]</ref> Others suggest that Heidegger's early insistence on the ontological priority of Dasein was muted in his post-war writings.<ref>H. Phillipse, ''Heidegger's Philosophy of Being'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9y2rHPCOgsC&pg=PA44 p. 44].</ref>{{rp|44}}

== Origin and inspiration ==
{{See also|Buddhism and Western philosophy#Heidegger}}
Some have argued for an origin of ''Dasein'' in [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Japanese philosophy]]: according to [[Tomonobu Imamichi]], Heidegger's concept of ''Dasein'' was inspired—although Heidegger remained silent on this—by [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das-in-der-Welt-sein'' (being-in-the-worldness, worldliness) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' to describe [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]'s [[Taoist]] philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.<ref name=Imamichi>Tomonubu Imamichi, ''In Search of Wisdom. One Philosopher's Journey'', Tokyo, International House of Japan, 2004 (quoted by [[Anne Fagot-Largeault]] at her [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm lesson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=February 6, 2009 }} at the [[College of France]] of 7 December 2006).</ref> Parallel concepts are also found in [[Indian philosophy]]<ref>Parkes, Graham (editor) (1987).

{{anchor|Existenz (Jaspers)}}

== Karl Jaspers' ''Dasein'' and ''Existenz'' ==

For [[Karl Jaspers]], the term \"''Dasein''\" meant existence in its most minimal sense, the realm of objectivity and science, in opposition to what Jaspers called \"''Existenz''\", the realm of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] being. Due to the drastically different use of the term \"''Dasein''\" between the two philosophers, there is often some confusion in students who begin with either Heidegger or Jaspers and subsequently study the other.

In ''Philosophy'' (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method can simply not transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a [[leap of faith]] toward what Jaspers calls \"Transcendence\". In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls ''Existenz'', and can finally experience authentic existence.

'''''Dasein''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdaːzaɪn}}) is a [[German language|German]] word that means \"being there\" or \"presence\" (German: ''[[wikt:da#German|da]]'' \"there\"; ''[[wikt:sein#German|sein]]'' \"being\"), and is often translated into English with the word \"existence\". It is a fundamental concept in the [[existential philosophy]] of [[Martin Heidegger]], particularly in his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' ''[[Being and Time]]''. Heidegger uses the expression ''Dasein'' to refer to the experience of [[being]] that is peculiar to human beings. Thus it is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as [[person]]hood, [[Death|mortality]] and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself.

==Heidegger's re-interpretation==
In German, ''Dasein'' is the vernacular term for \"existence\", as in \"I am pleased with my existence\" (''Ich bin mit meinem Dasein zufrieden''). The term has been used by several philosophers before Heidegger, most notably [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], with the meaning of human \"existence\" or \"presence\". It is derived from ''da-sein'', which literally means ''being-there/there-being''<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\">J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 70</ref>—though Heidegger was adamant that this was an inappropriate translation of ''Dasein''.<ref>[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus, H. L.]], ''Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time'' ([[Cambridge, MA]]: [[MIT Press]], 1990).</ref>
Dasein for Heidegger can be a way of being involved with and caring for the immediate world in which one lives, while always remaining aware of the contingent element of that involvement, of the priority of the world to the self, and of the evolving nature of the self itself.<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\"/>

The opposite of this authentic self is everyday and inauthentic Dasein, the forfeiture of one's individual meaning, destiny and lifespan, in favour of an (escapist) immersion in the public everyday world—the anonymous, identical world of [[das Man|the They]] and the Them.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 64-81</ref>

In harmony with [[Nietzsche]]'s critique of the [[subject (philosophy)#Nietzsche's critique of the subject|subject]], as something definable in terms of consciousness,  Heidegger distinguished Dasein from everyday consciousness in order to emphasize the critical importance \"Being\" has for our understanding and interpretation of the world, and so on.

<blockquote>
\"This entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term “Dasein”\" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.27).<ref name=\"Heidegger, M. 1962\">Heidegger, M. (1962). ''[[Being and Time]]'', Translated by [[John Macquarrie]] & [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]]. London: S.C.M. Press.</ref>

\"[Dasein is] that entity which in its Being has this very Being as an issue…\" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.68).<ref name=\"Heidegger, M. 1962\"/>
</blockquote>

Heidegger sought to use the concept of ''Dasein'' to uncover the primal nature of \"[[Being]]\" (''Sein''), agreeing with Nietzsche and [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]]<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 48</ref> that ''Dasein'' is always a being engaged in the world: neither a subject, nor the objective world alone, but the coherence of [[Being-in-the-world]]. This ontological basis of Heidegger's work thus opposes the Cartesian \"abstract agent\" in favour of practical engagement with one's environment.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 61</ref> Dasein is revealed by projection into, and engagement with, a personal world<ref>H. Phillipse, ''Heidegger's Philosophy of Being'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9y2rHPCOgsC&pg=PA220 p. 220].</ref>{{rp|220}}—a never-ending process of involvement with the world as mediated through the projects of the self.<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\"/>

Heidegger considered that language, everyday curiosity, [[logical system]]s, and common beliefs obscure ''Dasein's'' nature from itself.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 69-70</ref>  [[bad faith (existentialism)|Authentic choice]] means turning away from the collective world of Them, to face ''Dasein'', one's individuality, one's own limited life-span, one's own being.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 81-9</ref> Heidegger thus intended the concept of ''Dasein'' to provide a stepping stone in the questioning of what it means to ''be''—to have one's own being, one's own death, one's own truth.<ref>E. Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 96</ref>

Heidegger also saw the question of ''Dasein'' as extending beyond the realms disclosed by positive science or in the history of [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysics]].  “Scientific research is not the only manner of Being which this entity can have, nor is it the one which lies closest. Moreover, Dasein itself has a special distinctiveness as compared with other entities; [...] it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it.”<ref>Heidegger, Martin. \"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\" ''Being and Time'' / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 32</ref> ''[[Being and Time]]'' stressed the ontological difference between entities and the being ''of'' entities: “Being is always the Being of an entity.”<ref>Heidegger, Martin. \"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\" ''Being and Time'' / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 29.</ref> Establishing this difference is the general motif running through ''Being and Time''.

Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, arguing that for Heidegger \"''Dasein''\" denoted a structured awareness or an institutional \"way of life\".<ref>See John Haugeland's article [http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/haugeland/Reading+Brandom+Reading+Heidegger.pdf \"Reading Brandom Reading Heidegger\"]</ref> Others suggest that Heidegger's early insistence on the ontological priority of Dasein was muted in his post-war writings.<ref>H. Phillipse, ''Heidegger's Philosophy of Being'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9y2rHPCOgsC&pg=PA44 p. 44].</ref>{{rp|44}}

== Origin and inspiration ==
{{See also|Buddhism and Western philosophy#Heidegger}}
Some have argued for an origin of ''Dasein'' in [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Japanese philosophy]]: according to [[Tomonobu Imamichi]], Heidegger's concept of ''Dasein'' was inspired—although Heidegger remained silent on this—by [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das-in-der-Welt-sein'' (being-in-the-worldness, worldliness) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' to describe [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]'s [[Taoist]] philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.<ref name=Imamichi>Tomonubu Imamichi, ''In Search of Wisdom.

The '''Attack on Sudbury,''' also known as '''The Sudbury Fight''' (April 21, 1676), was a battle of [[King Philip's War]], fought in what is today [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]] and [[Wayland, Massachusetts]], when approximately five hundred [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] raided the frontier settlement of Sudbury in [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Disparate companies of [[English people|English]] [[Militia|militiamen]] from nearby settlements marched to the town's defense, two of which were drawn into Native ambushes and suffered heavy losses. The battle was the last major Native American victory in King Philip's War before their final defeat in southern [[New England]] in August 1676.   
== Background ==
The winter of 1676 brought a lull in the fighting of King Philip's War in eastern [[Massachusetts]], but come spring Native American forces resumed their raids on the area's [[Puritans|Puritan]] towns. The Native coalition attacked the strategically significant fort at [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] on both March 16 and April 7, destroying most of the settlement and forcing a partial evacuation of its residents. In response to these attacks, as well as the recent abandonment of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]] and [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], the colonial Council of War dispatched Captain Samuel Wadsworth and fifty men to Marlborough to reinforce the frontier. Wadsworth's company passed through Sudbury on the evening of April 20.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Schultz, Tougias|first=|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|publisher=The Countryman Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=207-213}}</ref>

Meanwhile, a large group of Native warriors departed the Nipmuc stronghold of [[Mount Wachusett]] and gathered on Pompositticut Hill (also known as Summer Hill in what is now [[Maynard, Massachusetts]]).

Native forces infiltrated Sudbury during the night<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=Douglas Edward|title=Flintlock and Tomahawk: New England in King Philip's War|publisher=Parnassus Imprints|year=1958|isbn=|location=|pages=173}}</ref> and attacked at dawn, burning houses and barns, as well as killing \"several persons,\" according to Puritan historian [[William Hubbard (clergyman)|William Hubbard]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hubbard|first=William|title=Narrative of the Indian Wars|publisher=John Trumbull|year=1677|isbn=|location=|pages=149}}</ref> Many English residents of Sudbury (most of whom lived on the east bank of the [[Sudbury River]], in present-day Wayland) abandoned their homes and sought refuge in the town's fortified [[Garrison house|garrison houses]]. The Natives besieged the Haynes garrison house on Water Row Road all morning but faced a stout defense from the English civilians within. At one point the Natives rolled a flaming cart full of [[flax]] downhill toward the garrison, only for the contraption to hit a rock and spill over before doing any damage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Powers|first=John C.|title=They Shall Not Tamely Give It Up|publisher=Sudbury Historical Society|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}</ref> The Haynes garrison held throughout the battle, though authors George Ellis and John Morris have speculated that the siege was a [[feint]] meant to draw English reinforcements to the area.<ref name=\":0\" /> 

\"Hearing the alarm,\"<ref name=\":3\" /> about a dozen men of Concord marched to Sudbury's defense. They were ambushed and massacred within full view of the defenders of the Haynes garrison. Only one of the Concord men escaped with his life,<ref name=\":0\" /> and the dead were buried in a mass grave just east of [[Old Town Bridge (Wayland, Massachusetts)|Old Town Bridge]] in Wayland. 

Flushed with victory, Native forces crossed the river and set about pillaging the central settlement of Sudbury.

As Mason took back control of the town, Captain Wadsworth approached from the west with about seventy men, his numbers bolstered by Captain Samuel Brocklebank's garrison at Marlborough. Wadsworth's men had rested only briefly in Marlborough before their march back east to defend Sudbury; they were hungry, exhausted, and completely ignorant of their enemy's position.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfGNboAyrA|title=The Sudbury Fight, 1676: A Decisive Native American Victory in King Philip's War|last=Rakich|first=Andrew|date=2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A mile from town, Wadsworth's men spotted about a hundred armed Natives darting off into the woods.

The Natives led the militia to the low ground between Goodman's Hill and Green Hill in present-day Sudbury, where they sprang an ambush, surrounding the small English force. Wadsworth fought his way to the summit of Green Hill, ordering his men to form a square, and repulsed multiple Native charges.<ref name=\":3\" /> The fighting went on all afternoon.

Native warriors then set fire to the dry brush of the hill, choking the English with smoke.<ref name=\":0\" /> In a panic, the English broke and ran.

The '''Attack on Sudbury,''' also known as '''The Sudbury Fight''' (April 21, 1676), was a battle of [[King Philip's War]], fought in what is today [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]] and [[Wayland, Massachusetts]], when approximately five hundred [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] raided the frontier settlement of Sudbury in [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Disparate companies of [[English people|English]] [[Militia|militiamen]] from nearby settlements marched to the town's defense, two of which were drawn into Native ambushes and suffered heavy losses. The battle was the last major Native American victory in King Philip's War before their final defeat in southern [[New England]] in August 1676.   
== Background ==
The winter of 1676 brought a lull in the fighting of King Philip's War in eastern [[Massachusetts]], but come spring Native American forces resumed their raids on the area's [[Puritans|Puritan]] towns. The Native coalition attacked the strategically significant fort at [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] on both March 16 and April 7, destroying most of the settlement and forcing a partial evacuation of its residents. In response to these attacks, as well as the recent abandonment of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]] and [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], the colonial Council of War dispatched Captain Samuel Wadsworth and fifty men to Marlborough to reinforce the frontier. Wadsworth's company passed through Sudbury on the evening of April 20.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Schultz, Tougias|first=|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|publisher=The Countryman Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=207-213}}</ref>

Meanwhile, a large group of Native warriors departed the Nipmuc stronghold of [[Mount Wachusett]] and gathered on Pompositticut Hill (also known as Summer Hill in what is now [[Maynard, Massachusetts]]).

Native forces infiltrated Sudbury during the night<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=Douglas Edward|title=Flintlock and Tomahawk: New England in King Philip's War|publisher=Parnassus Imprints|year=1958|isbn=|location=|pages=173}}</ref> and attacked at dawn, burning houses and barns, as well as killing \"several persons,\" according to Puritan historian [[William Hubbard (clergyman)|William Hubbard]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hubbard|first=William|title=Narrative of the Indian Wars|publisher=John Trumbull|year=1677|isbn=|location=|pages=149}}</ref> Many English residents of Sudbury (most of whom lived on the east bank of the [[Sudbury River]], in present-day Wayland) abandoned their homes and sought refuge in the town's fortified [[Garrison house|garrison houses]]. The Natives besieged the Haynes garrison house on Water Row Road all morning but faced a stout defense from the English civilians within. At one point the Natives rolled a flaming cart full of [[flax]] downhill toward the garrison, only for the contraption to hit a rock and spill over before doing any damage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Powers|first=John C.|title=They Shall Not Tamely Give It Up|publisher=Sudbury Historical Society|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}</ref> The Haynes garrison held throughout the battle, though authors George Ellis and John Morris have speculated that the siege was a [[feint]] meant to draw English reinforcements to the area.<ref name=\":0\" /> 

\"Hearing the alarm,\"<ref name=\":3\" /> about a dozen men of Concord marched to Sudbury's defense. They were ambushed and massacred within full view of the defenders of the Haynes garrison. Only one of the Concord men escaped with his life,<ref name=\":0\" /> and the dead were buried in a mass grave just east of [[Old Town Bridge (Wayland, Massachusetts)|Old Town Bridge]] in Wayland. 

Flushed with victory, Native forces crossed the river and set about pillaging the central settlement of Sudbury. Shortly before noon, English militiamen from [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] under the command of Captain Hugh Mason arrived and successfully repelled the raiding party.<ref name=\":0\" />

As Mason took back control of the town, Captain Wadsworth approached from the west with about seventy men, his numbers bolstered by Captain Samuel Brocklebank's garrison at Marlborough. Wadsworth's men had rested only briefly in Marlborough before their march back east to defend Sudbury; they were hungry, exhausted, and completely ignorant of their enemy's position.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfGNboAyrA|title=The Sudbury Fight, 1676: A Decisive Native American Victory in King Philip's War|last=Rakich|first=Andrew|date=2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A mile from town, Wadsworth's men spotted about a hundred armed Natives darting off into the woods.

The Natives led the militia to the low ground between Goodman's Hill and Green Hill in present-day Sudbury, where they sprang an ambush, surrounding the small English force.

\"'''The Story of an Hour'''\" is a [[short story]] written by [[Kate Chopin]] on April 19, 1894. It was originally published in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' on December 6, 1894, as \"'''The Dream of an Hour'''\". It was later reprinted in ''St. Louis Life'' on January 5, 1895, as \"The Story of an Hour\". <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nhung|first=Nguyen|title=The Story of an Hour|url=https://www.academia.edu/37918395|language=en}}</ref>

The title of the short story refers to the time elapsed between the moments at which the protagonist, Louise Mallard, hears that her husband, Brently Mallard, is dead, then discovers that he is alive after all. Featuring a female protagonist who feels liberation at the news of her husband's death, \"The Story of an Hour\" was controversial by American standards of the 1890s.<ref name=\":2\" /> In ''Unveiling Kate Chopin'', [[Emily Toth]] argues that Chopin \"had to have her heroine die\" in order to make the story publishable\".<ref>Toth, Emily (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qh6TWsIk-WsC&pg=PA10 ''Unveiling Kate Chopin'']. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, p. 10, {{ISBN|978-1-57806-101-3}}.</ref> (The \"heroine\" dies when she sees her husband alive after he was thought to be dead.)

==Summary==
\"The Story of an Hour\" follows Louise Mallard as she deals with the news of her husband, Brently Mallard's death. After being informed of her husband's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief. Louise heads to her room and gradually comes to the realization that she is happy that her husband died. Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home, and she dies of shock at the sight, due to complications of her heart disease.  \"From the joy that kills.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite wikisource|title=The Story of an Hour|first=Kate|last=Chopin|year=1894}}</ref>.
==Irony==
The irony of the death of Louise Mallard is something that plays a big role in the layout of the story. They say that she died \"From the joy that kills.\" She killed herself, not knowing that that would be the thing to kill her. She was finally realizing that she was happy without Brently in her life. When he arrives back home, she realizes that she is no longer happy again and that her life is just going to go back to the way it was before she thought he was dead. She ends up dying of heart complications, which in turn is the irony because we could read the story and see that she was going to die a lonely and almost depressed life. Then, she really ends up dying from her own joy killing her because she was excited to finally not have to deal with her husband.<ref>https://mycourses.purdue.edu/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabaction?tab_tab_group_id=_17_1</ref>
==Themes==
\"The Story of an Hour\" really focuses on women's search to find their own identities within themselves. Chopin, herself, liked to call this the \"possession of self-assertion.\" We can see by reading this story that she has brought her own life into the story. This story is like the background of Chopin. She had those rocky marriages. She was looking to find her own identity within herself. Louise is the Chopin during this story. She struggled to find herself many of times. This theme seems to really help Kate Chopin get an understanding of her own life during the times she was in. <ref>https://www.katechopin.org/the-story-of-an-hour/#themes</ref>

==Critical responses==
Bert Bender, a professor of English at Arizona State University, offers a biographical reading of the text and argues that writing of the 1890s was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[sexual selection]]. Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459–473.</ref>

Lawrence I. Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L. (2000) \"Fatal Self-Assertion in Kate Chopin's 'The Story of an Hour.'\" ''American Literary Realism'' '''32''' (2): 152–158.</ref> Xuding Wang has criticized Berkove's interpretation.<ref>Xuding Wang, \"[http://ir.lib.au.edu.tw/dspace/bitstream/987654321/83/1/019604107120.pdf Feminine Self-Assertion in 'The Story of an Hour']\", English Department, Tamkang University, Taiwan</ref>

In her article, \"Emotions in 'The Story of An Hour'\",<ref>Jamil, Selina S. \"Emotions in 'The Story of an Hour'\" Explicator (2009): 215–220. EBSCOhost.</ref> Selina Jamil argues that Chopin portrays Mrs. Mallard's perception of her husband's supposed death as fostered by emotions, rather than by rationality. Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she can realize her newfound freedoms). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.

In the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Chopin|first=Kate|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Story_of_an_Hour|title=The Story of an Hour}}</ref>. This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.

In a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Purdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology—specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85–89|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>

The way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and civilization) is moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.

While most readers infer Kate Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour” tells about the awakening of feminine awareness and the struggle for freedom in a man’s world, Li Chongyue and Wang Lihua offer a new analysis. They conclude that Mrs. Mallard is an ungrateful and unfaithful wife. Chopin provides little background on both Mr. and Mrs. Mallard. However, there’s enough evidence to assume they live a comfortable life. For example, the two-story home, the “comfortable” and “roomy” armchairs, and how one armchair sat “facing the open window”.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Chongyue|first=Li|last2=Lihua|first2=Wang|date=2013-05-14|title=A Caricature of an Ungrateful and Unfaithful Wife —A New Interpretation of The Story of an Hour|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ells/article/view/27476|journal=English Language and Literature Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=90|doi=10.5539/ells.v3n2p90|issn=1925-4768}}</ref>

In the article, Chongyue and Lihua point out how Brently Mallard loved his wife, but she didn’t feel the same. Mr. Mallard was often away from home on business trips to provide for his wife. Meanwhile, Louise only loved him “sometimes” and “often she had not loved him”.<ref name=\":4\" /> It’s fair for readers to infer that Louise only married him for security and stability. 

When she hears of her husband’s death, Mrs. Mallard weeps in her sister’s arms. Her reaction can be seen as genuine and coming from a place of pain. However, a second look could suggest that these are tears of joy. She was “pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach her soul” simply because she was tired of her life and needed a change. After emerging from her room succeeding the news of her husband, “she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory.”<ref name=\":3\" /> Her confidence can be seen as a result of triumph feeling as though she won her freedom back. Lastly, Mrs. Mallard died of “joy that kills” one could attribute that to the sudden change in emotion. However, it seems that her death was due to the fact that her newly found freedom and joy was stolen from her. 

Instead of a loving, ill wife, Mrs. Mallard is actually seen as ungrateful and unfaithful to her husband. Chongyue and Lihua conclude that such a woman cannot live on this earth, therefore, causing her death.

\"'''The Story of an Hour'''\" is a [[short story]] written by [[Kate Chopin]] on April 19, 1894. It was originally published in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' on December 6, 1894, as \"'''The Dream of an Hour'''\". It was later reprinted in ''St. Louis Life'' on January 5, 1895, as \"The Story of an Hour\". <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nhung|first=Nguyen|title=The Story of an Hour|url=https://www.academia.edu/37918395|language=en}}</ref>

The title of the short story refers to the time elapsed between the moments at which the protagonist, Louise Mallard, hears that her husband, Brently Mallard, is dead, then discovers that he is alive after all. Featuring a female protagonist who feels liberation at the news of her husband's death, \"The Story of an Hour\" was controversial by American standards of the 1890s.<ref name=\":2\" /> In ''Unveiling Kate Chopin'', [[Emily Toth]] argues that Chopin \"had to have her heroine die\" in order to make the story publishable\".<ref>Toth, Emily (1999).

==Summary==
\"The Story of an Hour\" follows Louise Mallard as she deals with the news of her husband, Brently Mallard's death. After being informed of her husband's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief. Louise heads to her room and gradually comes to the realization that she is happy that her husband died. Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home, and she dies of shock at the sight, due to complications of her heart disease.  \"From the joy that kills.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite wikisource|title=The Story of an Hour|first=Kate|last=Chopin|year=1894}}</ref>.
==Irony==
The irony of the death of Louise Mallard is something that plays a big role in the layout of the story. They say that she died \"From the joy that kills.\" She killed herself, not knowing that that would be the thing to kill her. She was finally realizing that she was happy without Brently in her life. When he arrives back home, she realizes that she is no longer happy again and that her life is just going to go back to the way it was before she thought he was dead. She ends up dying of heart complications, which in turn is the irony because we could read the story and see that she was going to die a lonely and almost depressed life. Then, she really ends up dying from her own joy killing her because she was excited to finally not have to deal with her husband.<ref>https://mycourses.purdue.edu/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabaction?tab_tab_group_id=_17_1</ref>
==Themes==
\"The Story of an Hour\" really focuses on the women's search to find their own identities within themselves. Chopin, herself, liked to call this the \"possession of self-assertion.\" We can see by reading this story that she has brought her own life into the story. This story is like the background of Chopin. She had those rocky marriages. She was looking to find her own identity within herself. Louise is the Chopin during this story. She struggled to find herself many of times. This theme seems to really help Kate Chopin get an understanding of her own life during the times she was in. <ref>https://www.katechopin.org/the-story-of-an-hour/#themes</ref>

==Critical responses==
Bert Bender, a professor of English at Arizona State University, offers a biographical reading of the text and argues that writing of the 1890s was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[sexual selection]]. Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459–473.</ref>

Lawrence I. Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L. (2000) \"Fatal Self-Assertion in Kate Chopin's 'The Story of an Hour.'\" ''American Literary Realism'' '''32''' (2): 152–158.</ref> Xuding Wang has criticized Berkove's interpretation.<ref>Xuding Wang, \"[http://ir.lib.au.edu.tw/dspace/bitstream/987654321/83/1/019604107120.pdf Feminine Self-Assertion in 'The Story of an Hour']\", English Department, Tamkang University, Taiwan</ref>

In her article, \"Emotions in 'The Story of An Hour'\",<ref>Jamil, Selina S. \"Emotions in 'The Story of an Hour'\" Explicator (2009): 215–220. EBSCOhost.</ref> Selina Jamil argues that Chopin portrays Mrs. Mallard's perception of her husband's supposed death as fostered by emotions, rather than by rationality. Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she can realize her newfound freedoms). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.

In the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Chopin|first=Kate|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Story_of_an_Hour|title=The Story of an Hour}}</ref>. This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.

In a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Purdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology—specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85–89|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>

The way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and civilization) is moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.

While most readers infer Kate Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour” tells about the awakening of feminine awareness and the struggle for freedom in a man’s world, Li Chongyue and Wang Lihua offer a new analysis. They conclude that Mrs. Mallard is an ungrateful and unfaithful wife. Chopin provides little background on both Mr. and Mrs. Mallard. However, there’s enough evidence to assume they live a comfortable life. For example, the two-story home, the “comfortable” and “roomy” armchairs, and how one armchair sat “facing the open window”.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Chongyue|first=Li|last2=Lihua|first2=Wang|date=2013-05-14|title=A Caricature of an Ungrateful and Unfaithful Wife —A New Interpretation of The Story of an Hour|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ells/article/view/27476|journal=English Language and Literature Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=90|doi=10.5539/ells.v3n2p90|issn=1925-4768}}</ref>

In the article, Chongyue and Lihua point out how Brently Mallard loved his wife, but she didn’t feel the same. Mr. Mallard was often away from home on business trips to provide for his wife. Meanwhile, Louise only loved him “sometimes” and “often she had not loved him”.<ref name=\":4\" /> It’s fair for readers to infer that Louise only married him for security and stability. 

When she hears of her husband’s death, Mrs. Mallard weeps in her sister’s arms. Her reaction can be seen as genuine and coming from a place of pain. However, a second look could suggest that these are tears of joy. She was “pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach her soul” simply because she was tired of her life and needed a change. After emerging from her room succeeding the news of her husband, “she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory.”<ref name=\":3\" /> Her confidence can be seen as a result of triumph feeling as though she won her freedom back. Lastly, Mrs. Mallard died of “joy that kills” one could attribute that to the sudden change in emotion. However, it seems that her death was due to the fact that her newly found freedom and joy was stolen from her. 

Instead of a loving, ill wife, Mrs. Mallard is actually seen as ungrateful and unfaithful to her husband. Chongyue and Lihua conclude that such a woman cannot live on this earth, therefore, causing her death.

\"'''The Story of an Hour'''\" is a [[short story]] written by [[Kate Chopin]] on April 19, 1894. It was originally published in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' on December 6, 1894, as \"'''The Dream of an Hour'''\".

==Summary==
\"The Story of an Hour\" follows Louise Mallard as she deals with the news of her husband, Brently Mallard's death. After being informed of her husband's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief. Louise heads to her room and gradually comes to the realization that she is happy that her husband died. Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home, and she dies of shock at the sight, due to complications of her heart disease.  \"From the joy that kills.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite wikisource|title=The Story of an Hour|first=Kate|last=Chopin|year=1894}}</ref>.
==Irony==
The irony of the death of Louise Mallard is something that plays a big role in the layout of the story. They say that she died \"From the joy that kills.\" She killed herself, not knowing that that would be the thing to kill her. She was finally realizing that she was happy without Brently in her life. When he arrives back home, she realizes that she is no longer happy again and that her life is just going to go back to the way it was before she thought he was dead. She ends up dying of heart complications, which in turn in the irony because we could read the story and see that she was going to die a lonely and almost depressed life. Then, she really ends up dying from her own joy killing her because she was excited to finally not have to deal with her husband.<ref>https://mycourses.purdue.edu/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabaction?tab_tab_group_id=_17_1</ref>
==Themes==
\"The Story of an Hour\" really focuses on the women's search to find their own identities within themselves. Chopin, herself, liked to call this the \"possession of self-assertion.\" We can see by reading this story that she has brought her own life into the story. This story is like the background of Chopin. She had those rocky marriages. She was looking to find her own identity within herself. Louise is the Chopin during this story. She struggled to find herself many of times. This theme seems to really help Kate Chopin get an understanding of her own life during the times she was in. <ref>https://www.katechopin.org/the-story-of-an-hour/#themes</ref>

==Critical responses==
Bert Bender, a professor of English at Arizona State University, offers a biographical reading of the text and argues that writing of the 1890s was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[sexual selection]]. Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459–473.</ref>

Lawrence I. Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L. (2000) \"Fatal Self-Assertion in Kate Chopin's 'The Story of an Hour.'\" ''American Literary Realism'' '''32''' (2): 152–158.</ref> Xuding Wang has criticized Berkove's interpretation.<ref>Xuding Wang, \"[http://ir.lib.au.edu.tw/dspace/bitstream/987654321/83/1/019604107120.pdf Feminine Self-Assertion in 'The Story of an Hour']\", English Department, Tamkang University, Taiwan</ref>

In her article, \"Emotions in 'The Story of An Hour'\",<ref>Jamil, Selina S. \"Emotions in 'The Story of an Hour'\" Explicator (2009): 215–220. EBSCOhost.</ref> Selina Jamil argues that Chopin portrays Mrs. Mallard's perception of her husband's supposed death as fostered by emotions, rather than by rationality. Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she can realize her newfound freedoms). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.

In the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Chopin|first=Kate|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Story_of_an_Hour|title=The Story of an Hour}}</ref>. This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.

In a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Purdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology—specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85–89|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>

The way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and civilization) is moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.

While most readers infer Kate Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour” tells about the awakening of feminine awareness and the struggle for freedom in a man’s world, Li Chongyue and Wang Lihua offer a new analysis. They conclude that Mrs. Mallard is an ungrateful and unfaithful wife. Chopin provides little background on both Mr. and Mrs. Mallard. However, there’s enough evidence to assume they live a comfortable life. For example, the two-story home, the “comfortable” and “roomy” armchairs, and how one armchair sat “facing the open window”.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Chongyue|first=Li|last2=Lihua|first2=Wang|date=2013-05-14|title=A Caricature of an Ungrateful and Unfaithful Wife —A New Interpretation of The Story of an Hour|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ells/article/view/27476|journal=English Language and Literature Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=90|doi=10.5539/ells.v3n2p90|issn=1925-4768}}</ref>

In the article, Chongyue and Lihua point out how Brently Mallard loved his wife, but she didn’t feel the same. Mr. Mallard was often away from home on business trips to provide for his wife. Meanwhile, Louise only loved him “sometimes” and “often she had not loved him”.<ref name=\":4\" /> It’s fair for readers to infer that Louise only married him for security and stability. 

When she hears of her husband’s death, Mrs. Mallard weeps in her sister’s arms. Her reaction can be seen as genuine and coming from a place of pain. However, a second look could suggest that these are tears of joy. She was “pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach her soul” simply because she was tired of her life and needed a change. After emerging from her room succeeding the news of her husband, “she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory.”<ref name=\":3\" /> Her confidence can be seen as a result of triumph feeling as though she won her freedom back. Lastly, Mrs. Mallard died of “joy that kills” one could attribute that to the sudden change in emotion. However, it seems that her death was due to the fact that her newly found freedom and joy was stolen from her. 

Instead of a loving, ill wife, Mrs. Mallard is actually seen as ungrateful and unfaithful to her husband. Chongyue and Lihua conclude that such a woman cannot live on this earth, therefore, causing her death.

==Characters==
Louise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard. She grieves the news of Brently's death, but is also overjoyed at her new freedom.

Brently Mallard - Husband to Louise and believed to be dead, he returns home not knowing he was believed to be dead

Josephine - Sister to Louise, she helps console Louise about her husband's death.

Richards - Brently Mallard's friend, was the one to learn of Brently's death<ref name=\":0\" />

Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459–473.</ref>

Lawrence I. Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L. (2000) \"Fatal Self-Assertion in Kate Chopin's 'The Story of an Hour.'\" ''American Literary Realism'' '''32''' (2): 152–158.</ref> Xuding Wang has criticized Berkove's interpretation.<ref>Xuding Wang, \"[http://ir.lib.au.edu.tw/dspace/bitstream/987654321/83/1/019604107120.pdf Feminine Self-Assertion in 'The Story of an Hour']\", English Department, Tamkang University, Taiwan</ref>

In her article, \"Emotions in 'The Story of An Hour'\",<ref>Jamil, Selina S. \"Emotions in 'The Story of an Hour'\" Explicator (2009): 215–220. EBSCOhost.</ref> Selina Jamil argues that Chopin portrays Mrs. Mallard's perception of her husband's supposed death as fostered by emotions, rather than by rationality. Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she can realize her newfound freedoms). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.

In the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Chopin|first=Kate|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Story_of_an_Hour|title=The Story of an Hour}}</ref>. This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.

In a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Purdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology—specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85–89|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>

The way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and civilization) is moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.

While most readers infer Kate Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour” tells about the awakening of feminine awareness and the struggle for freedom in a man’s world, Li Chongyue and Wang Lihua offer a new analysis. They conclude that Mrs. Mallard is an ungrateful and unfaithful wife. Chopin provides little background on both Mr. and Mrs. Mallard. However, there’s enough evidence to assume they live a comfortable life. For example, the two-story home, the “comfortable” and “roomy” armchairs, and how one armchair sat “facing the open window”.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Chongyue|first=Li|last2=Lihua|first2=Wang|date=2013-05-14|title=A Caricature of an Ungrateful and Unfaithful Wife —A New Interpretation of The Story of an Hour|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ells/article/view/27476|journal=English Language and Literature Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=90|doi=10.5539/ells.v3n2p90|issn=1925-4768}}</ref>

In the article, Chongyue and Lihua point out how Brently Mallard loved his wife, but she didn’t feel the same. Mr. Mallard was often away from home on business trips to provide for his wife. Meanwhile, Louise only loved him “sometimes” and “often she had not loved him”.<ref name=\":4\" /> It’s fair for readers to infer that Louise only married him for security and stability. 

When she hears of her husband’s death, Mrs. Mallard weeps in her sister’s arms. Her reaction can be seen as genuine and coming from a place of pain. However, a second look could suggest that these are tears of joy. She was “pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach her soul” simply because she was tired of her life and needed a change. After emerging from her room succeeding the news of her husband, “she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory.”<ref name=\":3\" /> Her confidence can be seen as a result of triumph feeling as though she won her freedom back. Lastly, Mrs. Mallard died of “joy that kills” one could attribute that to the sudden change in emotion. However, it seems that her death was due to the fact that her newly found freedom and joy was stolen from her. 

Instead of a loving, ill wife, Mrs. Mallard is actually seen as ungrateful and unfaithful to her husband. Chongyue and Lihua conclude that such a woman cannot live on this earth, therefore, causing her death.

==Characters==
Louise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard. She grieves the news of Brently's death, but is also overjoyed at her new freedom.

Brently Mallard - Husband to Louise and believed to be dead, he returns home not knowing he was believed to be dead

Josephine - Sister to Louise, she helps console Louise about her husband's death.

Richards - Brently Mallard's friend, was the one to learn of Brently's death<ref name=\":0\" />

==Film adaptation==
In 1984, director [[Tina Rathborne|Tina Rathbone]] released a film adaptation of the story titled ''[[The Joy That Kills]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/28/arts/tv-review-the-joy-that-kills-on-wnet.html|title=TV Review; 'The Joy That Kills,' on WNET|last=Corry|first=John|date=January 28, 1985|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}</ref> This film is based on Kate Chopin's story, \"The Story of an Hour\". The main character, Frances Conroy also suffers from a heart condition, just like Louise Mallard does. This production is mostly concerned with the psychological state.

Tábata's .744 OPS was just two points off of his career high OPS which is .746. Tábata finished up the 2013 season with 6 homers, a career best.

Under British rule, the British East India company could not compete with local muslin with their own export of cloth to the Indian subcontinent. The colonial government favored imports of British textiles. Colonial authorities attempted to suppress the local weaving culture. Muslin production greatly declined and the knowledge of weaving was nearly eradicated. It is alleged that in some instances the weavers were rounded up and their thumbs chopped off, although this has been refuted as an alleged misreading of a report from 1772.<ref>{{citation |last1=Bolts |first1=William |date=1772 |title=Considerations on India affairs |publisher=J Almon |page=194 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Edwards |first=Michael |date=June 1976 |title=Growth of the British Cotton Trade 1780–1815 |publisher=Augustus M Kelley Pubs |page=37 |isbn=0-678-06775-9}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Marshall |first=P.

== Uses ==
=== Dress-making and sewing ===
[[File:Muslin-Dresses-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Advantages of wearing Muslin Dresses!'' (1802), [[James Gillray]] caricatured a hazard of untreated muslin: its flammability.]]

When [[sewing]] clothing, a [[dressmaker]] may test the fit of a garment, using an inexpensive muslin fabric before cutting pieces from expensive fabric, thereby avoiding potential costly mistakes. This garment is often called a \"muslin,\" and the process is called \"making a muslin.\" In this context, \"muslin\" has become the generic term for a test or fitting garment, regardless of what it is made from.

Muslin is also often used as a backing or lining for quilts, and thus can often be found in wide widths in the quilting sections of fabric stores.

In Asia, Muslin is used for making sarees. Bengali or Dhakai Muslin Saree is popular in Asia. 

<br />

=== Shellac polishing ===
Muslin is used as a French polishing pad.

=== Culinary ===
{{main|Cheesecloth}}
Muslin can be used as a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]:
* In a funnel when decanting fine wine or port to prevent sediment from entering the decanter
* To separate liquid from mush (for example, to make apple juice: wash, chop, boil, mash, then filter by pouring the mush into a muslin bag suspended over a jug)
* To retain a liquidy solid (for example, in home cheese-making, when the milk has curdled to a gel, pour into a muslin bag and squash between two saucers (upside down under a brick) to squeeze out the liquid whey from the cheese curd)

Muslin is the material for the traditional [[pudding cloth|cloth]] wrapped around a [[Christmas pudding]].

Muslin is the fabric wrapped around the items in [[barmbrack]], a fruitcake traditionally eaten at Halloween in Ireland.

Muslin is used when making traditional [[Kava culture#Fiji|Fijian Kava]] as a filter.

[[beekeeping|Beekeepers]] use muslin to filter melted beeswax to clean it of particles and debris.

=== Theater and photography ===
Muslin is often the cloth of choice for theater sets. It is used to mask the background of [[set construction|sets]] and to establish the mood or feel of different scenes. It receives paint well and, if treated properly, can be made translucent.

It also holds dyes well. It is often used to create nighttime scenes because when dyed, it often gets a wavy look with the color varying slightly, such that it resembles a night sky. Muslin [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinks]] after it is painted or sprayed with water, which is desirable in some common techniques such as [[Flats (theater)|soft-covered flats]].

In video production as well, muslin is used as a cheap [[Chroma key|greenscreen or bluescreen]], either pre-colored or painted with latex paint (diluted with water). It is commonly used as a background for the [[chroma key]] technique.

Muslin is the most common backdrop material used by photographers for formal portrait backgrounds. These backdrops are usually painted, most often with an abstract mottled pattern.

In the early days of [[silent film]]-making, and up until the late 1910s, movie studios did not have the elaborate lights needed to illuminate indoor sets, so most interior scenes were sets built outdoors with large pieces of muslin hanging overhead to diffuse sunlight.

=== Medicine ===
[[File:Semplici medicamenti per i soldati.jpg|thumb|A [[first-aid]] packet of 5m of \"hydrophilic muslin\", given to Italian soldiers in World War I]]
Surgeons use muslin [[gauze]] in [[cerebrovascular]] [[neurosurgery]] to wrap around [[aneurysm]]s or intracranial vessels at risk for bleeding.<ref>{{citation |last=Pool |first=J. |date=1976 |title=Muslin gauze in intracranial vascular surgery.

It is often used for aneurysms that, due to their size or shape, cannot be microsurgically clipped or coiled.<ref>{{citation |last1=Berger |first1=C. |last2=Hartmann |first2=M. |last3=Wildemann |first3=B. |date=March 2003 |title=Progressive visual loss due to a muslinoma – report of a case and review of the literature |journal=European Journal of Neurology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=153–158 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-1331.2003.00546.x|pmid=12603290 }}</ref>

=== Early aviation ===
The Wright Brothers, in search of a light and strong covering for their gliders and the 1903 Wright Flyer (the first heavier-than-air powered aircraft), selected Pride of the West muslin as a covering for wings and control surfaces. A large piece of the fabric used on the original Wright Flyer (1903) was passed down to Wright descendants. The fabric was made available to The Wright Experience<ref>The Wright Experience</ref>(reproduction of the Wright gliders and Flyer and reenactment of the first flight on its 100th anniversary) for examination as it was no longer commercially available a century after its use by the Wrights. To create an authentic modern reproduction of the original fabric, three different companies were needed which produced the thread, the weaving, and the finishing.

Under British rule, the British East India company could not compete with local muslin with their own export of cloth to the Indian subcontinent. The colonial government favored imports of British textiles. Colonial authorities attempted to suppress the local weaving culture. Muslin production greatly declined and the knowledge of weaving was nearly eradicated. It is alleged that in some instances the weavers were rounded up and their thumbs chopped off, although this has been refuted as an alleged misreading of a report from 1772.<ref>{{citation |last1=Bolts |first1=William |date=1772 |title=Considerations on India affairs |publisher=J Almon |page=194 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Edwards |first=Michael |date=June 1976 |title=Growth of the British Cotton Trade 1780–1815 |publisher=Augustus M Kelley Pubs |page=37 |isbn=0-678-06775-9}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Marshall |first=P.

== Uses ==
=== Dress-making and sewing ===
[[File:Muslin-Dresses-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Advantages of wearing Muslin Dresses!'' (1802), [[James Gillray]] caricatured a hazard of untreated muslin: its flammability.]]

When [[sewing]] clothing, a [[dressmaker]] may test the fit of a garment, using an inexpensive muslin fabric before cutting pieces from expensive fabric, thereby avoiding potential costly mistakes. This garment is often called a \"muslin,\" and the process is called \"making a muslin.\" In this context, \"muslin\" has become the generic term for a test or fitting garment, regardless of what it is made from.

Muslin is also often used as a backing or lining for quilts, and thus can often be found in wide widths in the quilting sections of fabric stores.

In Asia, Muslin is used for making sarees. Bengali or Dhakai Muslin Saree is popular in Asia. 

<br />

=== Shellac polishing ===
Muslin is used as a French polishing pad.

=== Culinary ===
{{main|Cheesecloth}}
Muslin can be used as a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]:
* In a funnel when decanting fine wine or port to prevent sediment from entering the decanter
* To separate liquid from mush (for example, to make apple juice: wash, chop, boil, mash, then filter by pouring the mush into a muslin bag suspended over a jug)
* To retain a liquidy solid (for example, in home cheese-making, when the milk has curdled to a gel, pour into a muslin bag and squash between two saucers (upside down under a brick) to squeeze out the liquid whey from the cheese curd)

Muslin is the material for the traditional [[pudding cloth|cloth]] wrapped around a [[Christmas pudding]].

Muslin is the fabric wrapped around the items in [[barmbrack]], a fruitcake traditionally eaten at Halloween in Ireland.

Muslin is used when making traditional [[Kava culture#Fiji|Fijian Kava]] as a filter.

[[beekeeping|Beekeepers]] use muslin to filter melted beeswax to clean it of particles and debris.

=== Theater and photography ===
Muslin is often the cloth of choice for theater sets. It is used to mask the background of [[set construction|sets]] and to establish the mood or feel of different scenes. It receives paint well and, if treated properly, can be made translucent.

It also holds dyes well. It is often used to create nighttime scenes because when dyed, it often gets a wavy look with the color varying slightly, such that it resembles a night sky. Muslin [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinks]] after it is painted or sprayed with water, which is desirable in some common techniques such as [[Flats (theater)|soft-covered flats]].

In video production as well, muslin is used as a cheap [[Chroma key|greenscreen or bluescreen]], either pre-colored or painted with latex paint (diluted with water). It is commonly used as a background for the [[chroma key]] technique.

Muslin is the most common backdrop material used by photographers for formal portrait backgrounds. These backdrops are usually painted, most often with an abstract mottled pattern.

In the early days of [[silent film]]-making, and up until the late 1910s, movie studios did not have the elaborate lights needed to illuminate indoor sets, so most interior scenes were sets built outdoors with large pieces of muslin hanging overhead to diffuse sunlight.

=== Medicine ===
[[File:Semplici medicamenti per i soldati.jpg|thumb|A [[first-aid]] packet of 5m of \"hydrophilic muslin\", given to Italian soldiers in World War I]]
Surgeons use muslin [[gauze]] in [[cerebrovascular]] [[neurosurgery]] to wrap around [[aneurysm]]s or intracranial vessels at risk for bleeding.<ref>{{citation |last=Pool |first=J. |date=1976 |title=Muslin gauze in intracranial vascular surgery. Technical note. |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=127–128 |doi=10.3171/jns.1976.44.1.0127|pmid=1244428 }}</ref> The thought is that the gauze reinforces the artery and helps prevent rupture. It is often used for aneurysms that, due to their size or shape, cannot be microsurgically clipped or coiled.<ref>{{citation |last1=Berger |first1=C. |last2=Hartmann |first2=M. |last3=Wildemann |first3=B. |date=March 2003 |title=Progressive visual loss due to a muslinoma – report of a case and review of the literature |journal=European Journal of Neurology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=153–158 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-1331.2003.00546.x|pmid=12603290 }}</ref>

=== Early aviation ===
The Wright Brothers, in search of a light and strong covering for their gliders and the 1903 Wright Flyer (the first heavier-than-air powered aircraft), selected Pride of the West muslin as a covering for wings and control surfaces. A large piece of the fabric used on the original Wright Flyer (1903) was passed down to Wright descendants. The fabric was made available to The Wright Experience<ref>The Wright Experience</ref>(reproduction of the Wright gliders and Flyer and reenactment of the first flight on its 100th anniversary) for examination as it was no longer commercially available a century after its use by the Wrights. To create an authentic modern reproduction of the original fabric, three different companies were needed which produced the thread, the weaving, and the finishing.

==In popular culture==
In a Season 3 episode of ''[[Friends]]'', the character, [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] is seen holding a copy of this album and singing \"[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]\". The song was not a part of this release; however, the song now appears on the 2003 remastered edition as one of two bonus tracks (as a solo performance only).  At the time, \"Endless Love\" was available only on the original soundtrack to the 1981 [[Endless Love (1981 film)|movie of the same name]] starring [[Brooke Shields]], as well as Richie's compilation ''[[Back to Front (Lionel Richie album)|Back to Front]]'' and Diana Ross's ''[[One Woman: The Ultimate Collection]]''.

'''''Lionel Richie''''' is the eponymous debut solo [[studio album]] by American singer [[Lionel Richie]], released on October 6, 1982, on [[Motown Records]]. It was recorded and released while Richie was still a member of the [[Commodores]]; he left the group shortly after the album's release. The first single from the album, \"[[Truly (song)|Truly]]\", topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Follow-up single \"You Are\" reached number four, and \"My Love\" reached number five. The album was also a hit, reaching number one on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' albums chart on December 11, 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdb.hp.infoseek.co.jp/cb&bb/album%20no1/1982.htm |title=楽天が運営するポータルサイト ： 【インフォシーク】Infoseek |publisher=Msdb.hp.infoseek.co.jp |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref>

In 2003, ''Lionel Richie'' was re-released as part of a remaster series that saw two additional tracks added: a solo version of \"[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]\" and an instrumental version of \"You Are\".
[[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] member [[Joe Walsh]] provided the guitar solo for the song \"Wandering Stranger\".

==In popular culture==
In a Season 3 episode of ''[[Friends]]'', the character, [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] is seen holding a copy of this album and singing \"[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]\". The song was not a part of this release; however, the song now appears on the 2003 remastered edition as one of two bonus tracks (as a solo performance only).  At the time, \"Endless Love\" was available only on the original soundtrack to the 1981 [[Endless Love (1981 film)|movie of the same name]] starring [[Brooke Shields]], as well as Richie's compilation ''[[Back to Front (Lionel Richie album)|Back to Front]]'' and Diana Ross's ''[[One Woman: The Ultimate Collection]]''.

"",safe,Johnbandler,"A '''surrogate model''' is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured,{{disputed inline|Used when outcome cannot be directly measured?|date=January 2020}} so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.

One way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].

Though using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.

==Goals==

The scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:

* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)
* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias-variance trade-off)
* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.

The accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.

==Types of surrogate models==

Popular surrogate modeling approaches are: polynomial [[response surface]]s; [[kriging]]; [[gradient-enhanced kriging]] (GEK); [[radial basis function]]; [[support vector machine]]s; [[space mapping]] <ref name=\"space mapping\">[[John Bandler|J.W. Bandler]], Q. Cheng, S.A. Dakroury, A.S. Mohamed, M.H. Bakr, K. Madsen and J. Søndergaard, \"[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1262727 Space mapping: the state of the art],\" IEEE Trans.

For some problems, the nature of true function is not known a priori so it is not clear which surrogate model will be most accurate. In addition, there is no consensus on how to obtain the most reliable estimates of the accuracy of a given surrogate.
Many other problems have known physics properties. In these cases, physics-based surrogates such as [[space-mapping]] based models are the most efficient.<ref name=\"space mapping\" />

==Invariance properties==
Recently proposed comparison-based surrogate models (e.g. ranking [[support vector machine]]) for [[evolutionary algorithms]], such as [[CMA-ES]], allow to preserve some invariance properties of surrogate-assisted optimizers:

*1. Invariance with respect to monotonous transformations of the function (scaling)
*2. Invariance with respect to [[orthogonal transform]]ations of the search space (rotation).

==Applications==

An important distinction can be made between two different applications of surrogate models: design optimization and design space approximation (also known as emulation).

In surrogate model based optimization, an initial surrogate is constructed using some of the available budgets of expensive experiments and/or simulations. The remaining experiments/simulations are run for designs which the surrogate model predicts may have promising performance. The process usually takes the form of the following search/update procedure.

*1. Initial sample selection (the experiments and/or simulations to be run)
*2. Construct surrogate model
*3. Search surrogate model (the model can be searched extensively, e.g. using a [[genetic algorithm]], as it is cheap to evaluate)
*4. Run and update experiment/simulation at a new location(s) found by search and add to sample
*5. Iterate steps 2 to 4 until out of time or design 'good enough'

Depending on the type of surrogate used and the complexity of the problem, the process may converge on a local or global optimum, or perhaps none at all.<ref>Jones, D.R (2001), \"[http://www.ressources-actuarielles.net/EXT/ISFA/1226.nsf/9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6/e7dc33e4da12c5a9c12576d8002e442b/$FILE/Jones01.pdf A taxonomy of global optimization methods based on response surfaces],\" Journal of Global Optimization, 21:345–383.</ref>

In design space approximation, one is not interested in finding the optimal parameter vector but rather in the global behavior of the system. Here the surrogate is tuned to mimic the underlying model as closely as needed over the complete design space. Such surrogates are a useful, cheap way to gain insight into the global behavior of the system. Optimization can still occur as a post-processing step, although with no update procedure (see above) the optimum found cannot be validated.

== Surrogate modeling software ==
* Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT: https://github.com/SMTorg/smt): is a Python package that contains a collection of surrogate modeling methods, sampling techniques, and benchmarking functions. This package provides a library of surrogate models that is simple to use and facilitates the implementation of additional methods. SMT is different from existing surrogate modeling libraries because of its emphasis on derivatives, including training derivatives used for gradient-enhanced modeling, prediction derivatives, and derivatives with respect to the training data. It also includes new surrogate models that are not available elsewhere: kriging by partial-least squares reduction and energy-minimizing spline interpolation.<ref name = bouhlel2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Bouhlel | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Hwang | first2 = J.H. | last3 = Bartoli | first3 = Nathalie | last4 = Lafage |first4 = R. | last5 = Morlier | first5 = J. | last6 = Martins | first6 = J.R.R.A. | year = 2019 | title = A Python surrogate modeling framework with derivatives | journal = Advances in Engineering Software | volume = 135 | pages = 102662 | doi =10.1016/j.advengsoft.2019.03.005 | url = http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/content/python-surrogate-modeling-framework-derivatives }}</ref>

[[Category:Mathematical modeling]]","A '''surrogate model''' is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured,{{disputed inline|Used when outcome cannot be directly measured?|date=January 2020}} so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.

One way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].

Though using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.

==Goals==

The scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:

* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)
* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias-variance trade-off)
* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.

The accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.

==Types of surrogate models==

Popular surrogate modeling approaches are: polynomial [[response surface]]s; [[kriging]]; [[gradient-enhanced kriging]] (GEK); [[radial basis function]]; [[support vector machine]]s; [[space mapping]] <ref name=\"space mapping\">J.W. Bandler, Q. Cheng, S.A. Dakroury, A.S. Mohamed, M.H. Bakr, K. Madsen and J. Søndergaard, \"[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1262727 Space mapping: the state of the art],\" IEEE Trans.

For some problems, the nature of true function is not known a priori so it is not clear which surrogate model will be most accurate. In addition, there is no consensus on how to obtain the most reliable estimates of the accuracy of a given surrogate.
Many other problems have known physics properties. In these cases, physics-based surrogates such as [[space-mapping]] based models are the most efficient.<ref name=\"space mapping\" />

==Invariance properties==
Recently proposed comparison-based surrogate models (e.g. ranking [[support vector machine]]) for [[evolutionary algorithms]], such as [[CMA-ES]], allow to preserve some invariance properties of surrogate-assisted optimizers:

*1. Invariance with respect to monotonous transformations of the function (scaling)
*2. Invariance with respect to [[orthogonal transform]]ations of the search space (rotation).

==Applications==

An important distinction can be made between two different applications of surrogate models: design optimization and design space approximation (also known as emulation).

In surrogate model based optimization, an initial surrogate is constructed using some of the available budgets of expensive experiments and/or simulations. The remaining experiments/simulations are run for designs which the surrogate model predicts may have promising performance. The process usually takes the form of the following search/update procedure.

*1. Initial sample selection (the experiments and/or simulations to be run)
*2. Construct surrogate model
*3. Search surrogate model (the model can be searched extensively, e.g. using a [[genetic algorithm]], as it is cheap to evaluate)
*4. Run and update experiment/simulation at a new location(s) found by search and add to sample
*5. Iterate steps 2 to 4 until out of time or design 'good enough'

Depending on the type of surrogate used and the complexity of the problem, the process may converge on a local or global optimum, or perhaps none at all.<ref>Jones, D.R (2001), \"[http://www.ressources-actuarielles.net/EXT/ISFA/1226.nsf/9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6/e7dc33e4da12c5a9c12576d8002e442b/$FILE/Jones01.pdf A taxonomy of global optimization methods based on response surfaces],\" Journal of Global Optimization, 21:345–383.</ref>

In design space approximation, one is not interested in finding the optimal parameter vector but rather in the global behavior of the system. Here the surrogate is tuned to mimic the underlying model as closely as needed over the complete design space. Such surrogates are a useful, cheap way to gain insight into the global behavior of the system. Optimization can still occur as a post-processing step, although with no update procedure (see above) the optimum found cannot be validated.

[[Category:Mathematical modeling]]","A '''surrogate model''' is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured,{{disputed inline|Used when outcome cannot be directly measured?|date=January 2020}} so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.

One way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].

Though using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.

==Goals==

The scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:

* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)
* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias-variance trade-off)
* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.

The accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.

==Types of surrogate models==

Popular surrogate modeling approaches are: polynomial [[response surface]]s; [[kriging]]; [[gradient-enhanced kriging]] (GEK); [[radial basis function]]; [[support vector machine]]s; [[space mapping]] <ref name=\"space mapping\">[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1262727 J.W.

For some problems, the nature of true function is not known a priori so it is not clear which surrogate model will be most accurate. In addition, there is no consensus on how to obtain the most reliable estimates of the accuracy of a given surrogate.
Many other problems have known physics properties. In these cases, physics-based surrogates such as [[space-mapping]] based models are the most efficient.<ref name=\"space mapping\" />

==Invariance properties==
Recently proposed comparison-based surrogate models (e.g. ranking [[support vector machine]]) for [[evolutionary algorithms]], such as [[CMA-ES]], allow to preserve some invariance properties of surrogate-assisted optimizers:

*1. Invariance with respect to monotonous transformations of the function (scaling)
*2. Invariance with respect to [[orthogonal transform]]ations of the search space (rotation).

==Applications==

An important distinction can be made between two different applications of surrogate models: design optimization and design space approximation (also known as emulation).

In surrogate model based optimization, an initial surrogate is constructed using some of the available budgets of expensive experiments and/or simulations. The remaining experiments/simulations are run for designs which the surrogate model predicts may have promising performance. The process usually takes the form of the following search/update procedure.

*1. Initial sample selection (the experiments and/or simulations to be run)
*2. Construct surrogate model
*3. Search surrogate model (the model can be searched extensively, e.g. using a [[genetic algorithm]], as it is cheap to evaluate)
*4. Run and update experiment/simulation at a new location(s) found by search and add to sample
*5. Iterate steps 2 to 4 until out of time or design 'good enough'

Depending on the type of surrogate used and the complexity of the problem, the process may converge on a local or global optimum, or perhaps none at all.<ref>Jones, D.R (2001), \"[http://www.ressources-actuarielles.net/EXT/ISFA/1226.nsf/9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6/e7dc33e4da12c5a9c12576d8002e442b/$FILE/Jones01.pdf A taxonomy of global optimization methods based on response surfaces],\" Journal of Global Optimization, 21:345–383.</ref>

In design space approximation, one is not interested in finding the optimal parameter vector but rather in the global behavior of the system. Here the surrogate is tuned to mimic the underlying model as closely as needed over the complete design space. Such surrogates are a useful, cheap way to gain insight into the global behavior of the system. Optimization can still occur as a post-processing step, although with no update procedure (see above) the optimum found cannot be validated.

For some problems, the nature of true function is not known a priori so it is not clear which surrogate model will be most accurate. In addition, there is no consensus on how to obtain the most reliable estimates of the accuracy of a given surrogate.
Many other problems have known physics properties. In these cases, physics-based surrogates such as [[space-mapping]] based models are the most efficient.<ref name=\"space mapping\" />

==Invariance properties==
Recently proposed comparison-based surrogate models (e.g. ranking [[support vector machine]]) for [[evolutionary algorithms]], such as [[CMA-ES]], allow to preserve some invariance properties of surrogate-assisted optimizers:

*1. Invariance with respect to monotonous transformations of the function (scaling)
*2. Invariance with respect to [[orthogonal transform]]ations of the search space (rotation).

==Applications==

An important distinction can be made between two different applications of surrogate models: design optimization and design space approximation (also known as emulation).

In surrogate model based optimization, an initial surrogate is constructed using some of the available budgets of expensive experiments and/or simulations. The remaining experiments/simulations are run for designs which the surrogate model predicts may have promising performance. The process usually takes the form of the following search/update procedure.

*1. Initial sample selection (the experiments and/or simulations to be run)
*2. Construct surrogate model
*3. Search surrogate model (the model can be searched extensively, e.g. using a [[genetic algorithm]], as it is cheap to evaluate)
*4. Run and update experiment/simulation at a new location(s) found by search and add to sample
*5. Iterate steps 2 to 4 until out of time or design 'good enough'

Depending on the type of surrogate used and the complexity of the problem, the process may converge on a local or global optimum, or perhaps none at all.<ref>Jones, D.R (2001), \"[http://www.ressources-actuarielles.net/EXT/ISFA/1226.nsf/9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6/e7dc33e4da12c5a9c12576d8002e442b/$FILE/Jones01.pdf A taxonomy of global optimization methods based on response surfaces],\" Journal of Global Optimization, 21:345–383.</ref>

In design space approximation, one is not interested in finding the optimal parameter vector but rather in the global behavior of the system. Here the surrogate is tuned to mimic the underlying model as closely as needed over the complete design space. Such surrogates are a useful, cheap way to gain insight into the global behavior of the system. Optimization can still occur as a post-processing step, although with no update procedure (see above) the optimum found cannot be validated.

== Surrogate modeling software ==
* Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT: https://github.com/SMTorg/smt): is a Python package that contains a collection of surrogate modeling methods, sampling techniques, and benchmarking functions. This package provides a library of surrogate models that is simple to use and facilitates the implementation of additional methods. SMT is different from existing surrogate modeling libraries because of its emphasis on derivatives, including training derivatives used for gradient-enhanced modeling, prediction derivatives, and derivatives with respect to the training data. It also includes new surrogate models that are not available elsewhere: kriging by partial-least squares reduction and energy-minimizing spline interpolation.<ref name = bouhlel2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Bouhlel | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Hwang | first2 = J.H. | last3 = Bartoli | first3 = Nathalie | last4 = Lafage |first4 = R. | last5 = Morlier | first5 = J. | last6 = Martins | first6 = J.R.R.A. | year = 2019 | title = A Python surrogate modeling framework with derivatives | journal = Advances in Engineering Software | volume = 135 | pages = 102662 | doi =10.1016/j.advengsoft.2019.03.005 | url = http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/content/python-surrogate-modeling-framework-derivatives }}</ref>

Shortly after graduating, Wood moved to Los Angeles, where he worked as a studio assistant for two years for painter [[Laura Owens]] and then another two years for sculptor [[Matt Johnson (artist)|Matt Johnson]]. <ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/soanews/online/eblast-newsletters/october-2011/a-trio-of-artistic-trajectories/.|title=A Trio of Artistic Trajectories|website=School of Art News Events RSS}}</ref> While working as an assistant, Wood continued to make his own work. 

== Process ==
During his student years, he explored making collage-like works based on montaged photographs that he took of himself, his friends, and their surroundings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsandculturetx.com/painting-toward-intimacy-jonas-wood-at-dallas-museum-of-art/|title=Painting Toward Intimacy: Jonas Wood at Dallas Museum of Art|last1=August|first1=Laura|website=Arts & Culture Texas}}</ref> Wood now paints from studies ([[collage]]s and [[drawing]]s) and sometimes uses [[photography]], but most of his works and studies are part of the larger plan of creating paintings.<ref name=\"QwAJW\" /> Wood states, \"I work from photos.

And a bunch of times, I’ll make a drawing from a found photo, a photo collage, or photo I took, and then make a painting from that drawing.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/jonas-wood-interview-1501156|title=I Was So Afraid for Way Too Long': Jonas Wood on How Going It Alone Helped Him Survive His Immense Art-Market Success|last1=Pobric|first1=Pac|website=Artnet News}}</ref> Wood has also done [[etching]]s.<ref name=\"SSF\" /> He maintains active drawing, [[printmaking]], and collage practices, each of which helps him generate techniques that he eventually uses in his paintings.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.davidkordanskygallery.com/artist/jonas-wood.|title=Jonas Wood|last1=Kordansky|first1=David|website=David Kordansky Gallery}}</ref>  

Wood's studio is filled with the objects that influence his work, such as his children's drawings, plants, vessels, and sport memorabilia. An example of this includes a giant basketball sculpture by [[Paa Joe]]. He also works in close proximity to his partner, Shio Kusaka, whose work he appropriates and collaborates with. Wood's influences are also auditory, as he tends to listen to basketball podcasts while he works.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/t-magazine/jonas-wood.html|title=An Artist on Finding Balance, and His Giant Basketball Sculpture|last1=Zara|first1=Janelle|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> 

A [[The New York Times|New York Times]] article by Janelle Zara states, \"the studio is where Wood culls various photographs from the internet or his own archive and uses them as source material for his paintings\". The appropriated imagery is organized in labeled folders in his studio to be physically accessible during his painting process. The images are printed out and pinned onto walls, then flattened and distilled into blocks of color. Wood then layers these \"dense graphic patterns, overlapping fields of stipples and stripes, circles, squares, dots and wood grains\".<ref name=\":4\" /> 

== Themes ==
Jonas Wood’s paintings, drawings, and prints can be described as a myriad of genres, such as domestic interiors, landscapes, still-life and sports scenes.<ref name=\"SSF\" /> Translating the three-dimensional world around him into flat color and line, he confounds expectations of scale and vantage point that reflect an instantly recognizable vision of the contemporary world.<ref name=\":0\" />

In an ''[[Architectural Digest]]'' story by Rebecca Bates, Wood claimed to paint to create new memories of his former residences: \"I'm interested in exploring the spaces that I’ve inhabited and the psychological impact they've had on me and my memories of them,...And then I can create a new memory of that space.\"<ref name=\"diges\">{{cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/blogs/daily/2013/09/jonas-wood-mosaics-anton-kern-gallery|title=Jonas Wood at Anton Kern Gallery|author=Bates, Rebecca|date=September 12, 2013|work=[[Architectural Digest]]|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref> The result is the perception that his work is very sincere.<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/arts/design/12gall.html|title=Art in Review|author=Johnson, Ken|date=December 11, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>

== Style ==
Wood's style is described as multidimensional. In ''[[T: The New York Times Style Magazine|T]]'', he was described as working \"With one foot in [[Modernist]] cool and the other in vibrant [[Pop Art]]\".<ref name=\"TI\" /> Similarly, [[Artspace]] describes his work as if he works \"With one foot rooted in [[Analytic Cubism]] and the other in Contemporary [[Pop art]]\".<ref name=\"JWA\" /> In ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' Wood is described in reminiscence of classic masters: \"Although Wood pays homage to [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] along with other abstract colorists like [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Keith Haring]], his works are decidedly modern... Both steeped in tradition yet completely fresh, Wood captures the impossible sharpness of modernity with the familiar feelings of home.\"<ref name=\"JWIYIHCWPI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/30/jonas-wood_n_4005422.html|title=Jonas Wood Invites You Into His Colorful, Warped Painted Interiors|author=Frank, Priscilla|date=September 30, 2013|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref> [[Roberta Smith]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' notes that \"his works negotiate an uneasy truce among the abstract, the representational, the photographic and the just plain weird.\"<ref name=\"PbJW\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/arts/design/paintings-by-jonas-wood-at-anton-kern-gallery-art-review.html|title=Paintings by Jonas Wood|author=Smith, Roberta|date=March 17, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>

== Marriage ==
Wood currently shares a studio with artist [https://gagosian.com/artists/shio-kusaka/ Shio Kusaka], his wife since 2002. Shio Kusaka, born in Japan, creates distinctive porcelain, and Wood then photographs and paints the pieces for co-operative exhibitions. The pair often work in tandem, motifs migrating from Kusaka’s ceramic vessels to Wood’s paintings and back again. He and Kusaka also incorporate imagery from their expansive art collection—including works by [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Michael Frimkess]] and [[Magdalena Suarez Frimkess]], [[Mark Grotjahn]], and [[Edward Ruscha|Ed Ruscha]]—as well as from their children’s storybooks and drawings.<ref name=\":2\" /> They co-author art books in a series with the pen name ''Wood Kusaka Studios''.<ref name=\"hampt\">{{cite web|url=http://hamptonsarthub.com/2013/05/22/jonas-wood-shio-kusaka-still-life-with-pots-opens-may-25-at-glenn-horowitz-bookseller/|title=\"Jonas Wood & Shio Kusaka: Still Life With Pots\" opens May 25 at Glenn Horowitz Bookseller|date=May 22, 2013|publisher=Hamptons Art Hub|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>

In 2015 [[Gagosian Gallery|Gagosian]] in Hong Kong presented Blackwelder, which brought together Wood’s and Kusaka’s works in a dedicated two-person exhibition. This was followed by the couple’s first collaborative museum exhibition, at [[Museum Voorlinden]], Wassenaar, Netherlands, in 2017.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Exhibitions ==
Black Dragon Society was the first gallery in Los Angeles to represent his work and give him a solo exhibition in 2006. Artist [[Mark Grotjahn]] saw Wood’s paintings at that show and told Anton Kern Gallery in New York City about it. The result was Anton Kern Gallery mounting a one-man exhibition for Wood during the summer of 2007, and then Shane Campbell Gallery in Chicago hosted a solo show two months later. From that point on, he has continued to exhibit his work regularly.<ref name=\":1\" />

Past solo exhibition have been held at at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] (2019); Museum Voorlinden, Wassenaar, the Netherlands (with Shio Kusaka, 2017); [[Lever House]], New York (2014); and [[Hammer Museum]], Los Angeles (2010).<ref name=\":3\" /> 

Other solo projects include Still Life with Two Owls (MOCA), the façade of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], Los Angeles (2016- 2018); Shelf Still Life, High Line Billboard, [[High Line Art]], New York (2014); and LAXART Billboard and Façade, LAXART, Los Angeles (2014).<ref name=\":3\" /> 

His work is included in the permanent collections of many institutions, among them the [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery|Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], Buffalo, New York; [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris; Dallas Museum of Art; Fundación Jumex, Mexico City; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; [[Marciano Art Foundation]], Los Angeles; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]; [[Solomon R.

Wood's influences are also auditory, as he tends to listen to basketball podcasts while he works.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/t-magazine/jonas-wood.html|title=An Artist on Finding Balance, and His Giant Basketball Sculpture|last1=Zara|first1=Janelle|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> 

A [[The New York Times|New York Times]] article by Janelle Zara states, \"the studio is where Wood culls various photographs from the internet or his own archive and uses them as source material for his paintings\". The appropriated imagery is organized in labeled folders in his studio to be physically accessible during his painting process. The images are printed out and pinned onto walls, then flattened and distilled into blocks of color. Wood then layers these \"dense graphic patterns, overlapping fields of stipples and stripes, circles, squares, dots and wood grains\".<ref name=\":4\" /> 

== Themes ==
Jonas Wood’s paintings, drawings, and prints can be described as a myriad of genres, such as domestic interiors, landscapes, still-life and sports scenes.<ref name=\"SSF\" /> Translating the three-dimensional world around him into flat color and line, he confounds expectations of scale and vantage point that reflect an instantly recognizable vision of the contemporary world.<ref name=\":0\" />

In an ''[[Architectural Digest]]'' story by Rebecca Bates, Wood claimed to paint to create new memories of his former residences: \"I'm interested in exploring the spaces that I’ve inhabited and the psychological impact they've had on me and my memories of them,...And then I can create a new memory of that space.\"<ref name=\"diges\">{{cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/blogs/daily/2013/09/jonas-wood-mosaics-anton-kern-gallery|title=Jonas Wood at Anton Kern Gallery|author=Bates, Rebecca|date=September 12, 2013|work=[[Architectural Digest]]|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref> The result is the perception that his work is very sincere.<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/arts/design/12gall.html|title=Art in Review|author=Johnson, Ken|date=December 11, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>

== Style ==
Wood's style is described as multidimensional. In ''[[T: The New York Times Style Magazine|T]]'', he was described as working \"With one foot in [[Modernist]] cool and the other in vibrant [[Pop Art]]\".<ref name=\"TI\" /> Similarly, [[Artspace]] describes his work as if he works \"With one foot rooted in [[Analytic Cubism]] and the other in Contemporary [[Pop art]]\".<ref name=\"JWA\" /> In ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' Wood is described in reminiscence of classic masters: \"Although Wood pays homage to [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] along with other abstract colorists like [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Keith Haring]], his works are decidedly modern... Both steeped in tradition yet completely fresh, Wood captures the impossible sharpness of modernity with the familiar feelings of home.\"<ref name=\"JWIYIHCWPI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/30/jonas-wood_n_4005422.html|title=Jonas Wood Invites You Into His Colorful, Warped Painted Interiors|author=Frank, Priscilla|date=September 30, 2013|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref> [[Roberta Smith]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' notes that \"his works negotiate an uneasy truce among the abstract, the representational, the photographic and the just plain weird.\"<ref name=\"PbJW\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/arts/design/paintings-by-jonas-wood-at-anton-kern-gallery-art-review.html|title=Paintings by Jonas Wood|author=Smith, Roberta|date=March 17, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>

== Marriage ==
Wood currently shares a studio with artist [https://gagosian.com/artists/shio-kusaka/ Shio Kusaka], his wife since 2002. Shio Kusaka, born in Japan, creates distinctive porcelain, and Wood then photographs and paints the pieces for co-operative exhibitions. The pair often work in tandem, motifs migrating from Kusaka’s ceramic vessels to Wood’s paintings and back again. Common subjects include plants, portraits, and sports imagery, all of which come together in Wood’s lush interiors and intricate still lifes. He and Kusaka also incorporate imagery from their expansive art collection—including works by [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Michael Frimkess]] and [[Magdalena Suarez Frimkess]], [[Mark Grotjahn]], and [[Edward Ruscha|Ed Ruscha]]—as well as from their children’s storybooks and drawings.<ref name=\":2\" /> They co-author art books in a series with the pen name ''Wood Kusaka Studios''.<ref name=\"hampt\">{{cite web|url=http://hamptonsarthub.com/2013/05/22/jonas-wood-shio-kusaka-still-life-with-pots-opens-may-25-at-glenn-horowitz-bookseller/|title=\"Jonas Wood & Shio Kusaka: Still Life With Pots\" opens May 25 at Glenn Horowitz Bookseller|date=May 22, 2013|publisher=Hamptons Art Hub|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>

In 2015 [[Gagosian Gallery|Gagosian]] in Hong Kong presented Blackwelder, which brought together Wood’s and Kusaka’s works in a dedicated two-person exhibition. This was followed by the couple’s first collaborative museum exhibition, at [[Museum Voorlinden]], Wassenaar, Netherlands, in 2017.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Exhibitions ==
Black Dragon Society was the first gallery in Los Angeles to represent his work and give him a solo exhibition in 2006. Artist [[Mark Grotjahn]] saw Wood’s paintings at that show and told Anton Kern Gallery in New York City about it. The result was Anton Kern Gallery mounting a one-man exhibition for Wood during the summer of 2007, and then Shane Campbell Gallery in Chicago hosted a solo show two months later. From that point on, he has continued to exhibit his work regularly.<ref name=\":1\" />

Past solo exhibition have been held at at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] (2019); Museum Voorlinden, Wassenaar, the Netherlands (with Shio Kusaka, 2017); [[Lever House]], New York (2014); and [[Hammer Museum]], Los Angeles (2010).<ref name=\":3\" /> 

Other solo projects include Still Life with Two Owls (MOCA), the façade of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], Los Angeles (2016- 2018); Shelf Still Life, High Line Billboard, [[High Line Art]], New York (2014); and LAXART Billboard and Façade, LAXART, Los Angeles (2014).<ref name=\":3\" /> 

His work is included in the permanent collections of many institutions, among them the [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery|Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], Buffalo, New York; [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris; Dallas Museum of Art; Fundación Jumex, Mexico City; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; [[Marciano Art Foundation]], Los Angeles; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]; [[Solomon R.

A '''sprain''', also known as a '''torn ligament''', is the stretching or tearing of [[ligaments]] within a [[joint]], often caused by trauma abruptly forcing the joint beyond its functional range of motion. Ligaments are inelastic [[collagen]] fibers that connect two or more bones to a joint and are important for joint stabilization and [[proprioception]], which is the body's sense of limb position and movement.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bahr|first=Roald|title=Types and Causes of Injuries|date=2012-06-22|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118467947.ch1|work=The IOC Manual of Sports Injuries|pages=1–24|editor-last=Bahr|editor-first=Roald|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|doi=10.1002/9781118467947.ch1|isbn=978-1-118-46794-7|access-date=2020-04-13|last2=Alfredson|first2=Håkan|last3=Järvinen|first3=Markku|last4=Järvinen|first4=Tero|last5=Khan|first5=Karim|last6=Kjaer|first6=Michael|last7=Matheson|first7=Gordon|last8=Maehlum|first8=Sverre}}</ref> The severity of sprains ranges from a minor injury that resolves with [[Conservative management|conservative treatment]] to a severe rupture or fracture leading to joint instability, which requires surgical fixation and prolonged immobilization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.physio-pedia.com/Ligament_Sprain|title=Ligament Sprain|website=Physiopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> Sprains can occur at any joint but are most common in the ankle and wrist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/health/reference/Home-Cyclopedia-Of-Health-And-Medicine/Sprained-Joints.html|title=Sprained Joints|work=Free Books|access-date=16 February 2010}}</ref> An equivalent injury to a [[muscle]] or a [[tendon]] is known as a [[Strain (injury)|strain]].

* [[Pain]]
* [[Swelling (medical)|Swelling]]
* [[bruise|Bruising]]
* Decreased ability to move the limb
* If a ligament ruptures, one may hear a cracking sound
* Difficulty using the affected [[Limb (anatomy)|extremity]]

== Causes ==
Sprains typically occur when the joint is taken beyond its functional range of motion.
[[File:Sprained wrist 8 days later (2).jpg|thumb|Sprain of wrist after fall while ice skating|150 px|right]]
There are certain factors which increase risk of sprains. [[fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]] of muscles generally leads to sprains. When one suddenly starts to exercise after a [[sedentary lifestyle]], sprains are quite common.
While scientific studies are lacking, it is often thought that not 'warming up' is a common cause of sprains in athletes {{Citation needed|reason=Often thought by whom?|date=August 2017}}. 'Warming up' is thought to loosen the joint, increasing [[blood flow]] and making the joint more flexible {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnosis of a sprain can often be made with a good degree of certainty by [[physical examination]] based on the clinical presentation and method of injury.  In some cases,  [[X-ray]]s are obtained to ensure that there is no [[bone fracture|fracture]]. In some cases, particularly if the injury is prolonged or does not appear to be resolving as expected, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is performed to look at surrounding [[soft tissue]]s and the [[ligament]].<ref>[http://mayoclinic.com/health/sprains-and-strains/DS00343/ Strains and sprains information]  Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref>

=== Classification ===
# First degree sprain (mild) – the fibres of the ligament are stretched but intact.
# Second degree sprain (moderate) – is a tear of part of a ligament, from a third to almost all its fibres.
# Third degree sprain (severe)– is a complete rupture of the ligament, sometimes [[avulsion fracture|avulsing]] a piece of bone.
[[File:Sprain SAG.jpg|thumb|300px| A 3D medical animation still shot illustrating a sprain|A 3D medical animation still shot illustrating a sprain]]

=== Joints involved ===
Although any joint can experience a sprain, some of the more common include:
 
* The [[ankle]]. It is the most common, and has been said that sprains such as serious ankle sprains are more painful and take longer to heal than actually breaking the bones in that area.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = David | last1 = Shier | first2 = Jackie | last2 = Butler | first3 = Ricki | last3 = Lewis | name-list-format = vanc |title=Hole's Human Anatomy & Physiology |date=2007 |publisher=McGraw Hill / Irwin |isbn=978-0-07-330555-4 |pages=157, 160 |edition=11th}}</ref> See [[sprained ankle]] for more details.
* The [[knee]]. One of the more talked about sprains is that to the [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) of the knee.  This is a disabling sprain common to athletes, especially in [[American football]], [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[pole vaulting]], [[softball]], [[baseball]] and some styles of [[martial arts]]. See [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury]].
* Ligaments between the spinal vertebrae
* The [[finger]]s.
* The [[wrist]].
* The [[toe]]s.

== Treatment ==
The first modality for a sprain can be remembered using the acronym [[RICE (medicine)|RICE]].<ref>{{MedicalMnemonics|235|||}}</ref> The treatment of sprains depends on the extent of injury and the joint involved. Medications like [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] can relieve pain. Topical NSAIDs appear to be as good as those taken by mouth.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Derry S, Moore RA, Gaskell H, McIntyre M, Wiffen PJ | title = Topical NSAIDs for acute musculoskeletal pain in adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = CD007402 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26068955 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007402.pub3 | pmc = 6426435 }}</ref> Research suggest PRICE, as a way of managing an ankle sprain.<ref name=\":1\" />

* '''Protect:''' It is important to protect the injured site from repetitive injury.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bleakley CM, O'Connor SR, Tully MA, Rocke LG, Macauley DC, Bradbury I, Keegan S, McDonough SM | title = Effect of accelerated rehabilitation on function after ankle sprain: randomised controlled trial | journal = BMJ | volume = 340 | issue = may10 1 | pages = c1964 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20457737 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c1964 }}</ref>

* '''Rest:''' The sprain should be rested. No additional force should be applied on site of the sprain.  In case of, for example, a [[sprained ankle]], [[walking]] should be kept to a minimum.<ref name=\"AAOS\">{{cite web|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00150 |title=Sprained Ankle |access-date=2008-04-01 |date=March 2005 |publisher=American [[Orthopedic]] Foot and Ankle Society }}</ref>
* '''Ice:''' Ice should be applied immediately to the sprain to reduce swelling and pain.  It can be applied for 10–15 minutes at a time, 3–4 times a day.  Ice can be combined with a wrapping to minimize swelling and provide support.<ref name=\"AAOS\" /> Ice to numb the pain is effective, but only for a short period of time (no more than twenty minutes.)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cramer H, Ostermann T, Dobos G | title = Injuries and other adverse events associated with yoga practice: A systematic review of epidemiological studies | journal = Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–154 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28958637 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsams.2017.08.026 }}</ref> Longer than 20 minutes can reduce the blood flow to the injured area and slow the healing process.{{medcn|date=March 2019}}
* '''Compression:''' Dressings, bandages, or ace-wraps should be used to immobilize the sprain and provide support. When wrapping the injury, more pressure should be applied at the far end of the injury and decrease in the direction of the heart; the reason for this is that it more easily causes unnecessary fluid to be flushed back up the blood stream in order to be recycled. Compression should not cut off the circulation of the limb.<ref name=\"AAOS\" />
* '''Elevation:''' Keeping the sprained joint elevated (in relation to the rest of the body) will also help minimize swelling.<ref name=\"AAOS\" />

Non operative treatments including continuous passive motion (a machine that puts the joint through range of motion) combined with a cryocuff, which applies cold and compression, are successful in reducing swelling and improving range of motion.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Temponi EF, Saithna A, de Carvalho LH, Teixeira BP, Sonnery-Cottet B | title = Nonoperative Treatment for Partial Ruptures of the Lateral Collateral Ligament Occurring in Combination With Complete Ruptures of the Anterolateral Ligament: A Common Injury Pattern in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Athletes With Acute Knee Injury | journal = Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 2325967118822450 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30719481 | pmc = 6348520 | doi = 10.1177/2325967118822450 }}</ref> Strength and functional training that is implemented as soon as the edema subsides also aids in increasing range of motion of the joint.<ref name=\":0\" />

Ice and compression ([[cold compression therapy]]) will not completely stop swelling and pain, but will help to minimize them as the sprain begins to heal itself.  Careful management of swelling is critical to the healing process as additional fluid may pool in the sprained area.

The joint should be exercised again fairly soon, in milder cases from 1 to 3 days after injury.<ref name=familydoctor>[http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/healthy/physical/injuries/010.html Ankle Sprains: Healing and Preventing Injury] Written by familydoctor.org editorial staff. American Academy of Family Physicians. Reviewed/Updated: 08/06. Created: 01/96</ref> Special exercises are sometimes needed in order to regain strength and help reduce the risk of ongoing problems. The joint may need to be supported by taping or bracing, helping protect it from re-injury.<ref name=familydoctor />

=== Functional rehabilitation ===
Prolonged [[Muscle immobilization|immobilization]] delays the healing of a sprain, as it usually leads to [[muscle atrophy]] and weakness. Mobilizing the limb soon after a sprain has been shown to promote healing by stimulating growth factors in musculoskeletal tissues linked to cellular multiplication and matrix remodeling.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The components of an effective rehabilitation program for all sprain injuries include increasing range of motion and progressive muscle strengthening exercise.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Although prolonged immobilization can  have a negative effect on recovery, recent studies suggest that the use of a brace can improve healing by alleviating pain and stabilizing the injury, which helps prevent further damage to the ligament.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Hsu|first=Hunter |last2=Siwiec |first2=Ryan M.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Forearm Splinting |date=2019 |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499980/ |work=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=29763155 |access-date=2019-03-12}}</ref> When using a brace, it is very important to apply the correct amount of pressure, as too much can cause complications.<ref name=\":2\" />

* '''Compression:''' Dressings, bandages, or ace-wraps should be used to immobilize the sprain and provide support. When wrapping the injury, more pressure should be applied at the far end of the injury and decrease in the direction of the heart; the reason for this is that it more easily causes unnecessary fluid to be flushed back up the blood stream in order to be recycled. Compression should not cut off the circulation of the limb.<ref name=\"AAOS\" />
* '''Elevation:''' Keeping the sprained joint elevated (in relation to the rest of the body) will also help minimize swelling.<ref name=\"AAOS\" />

Non operative treatments including continuous passive motion (a machine that puts the joint through range of motion) combined with a cryocuff, which applies cold and compression, are successful in reducing swelling and improving range of motion.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Temponi EF, Saithna A, de Carvalho LH, Teixeira BP, Sonnery-Cottet B | title = Nonoperative Treatment for Partial Ruptures of the Lateral Collateral Ligament Occurring in Combination With Complete Ruptures of the Anterolateral Ligament: A Common Injury Pattern in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Athletes With Acute Knee Injury | journal = Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 2325967118822450 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30719481 | pmc = 6348520 | doi = 10.1177/2325967118822450 }}</ref> Strength and functional training that is implemented as soon as the edema subsides also aids in increasing range of motion of the joint.<ref name=\":0\" />

Ice and compression ([[cold compression therapy]]) will not completely stop swelling and pain, but will help to minimize them as the sprain begins to heal itself.  Careful management of swelling is critical to the healing process as additional fluid may pool in the sprained area.

The joint should be exercised again fairly soon, in milder cases from 1 to 3 days after injury.<ref name=familydoctor>[http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/healthy/physical/injuries/010.html Ankle Sprains: Healing and Preventing Injury] Written by familydoctor.org editorial staff. American Academy of Family Physicians. Reviewed/Updated: 08/06. Created: 01/96</ref> Special exercises are sometimes needed in order to regain strength and help reduce the risk of ongoing problems. The joint may need to be supported by taping or bracing, helping protect it from re-injury.<ref name=familydoctor />

=== Functional rehabilitation ===
Prolonged [[Muscle immobilization|immobilization]] delays the healing of a sprain, as it usually leads to [[muscle atrophy]] and weakness. Mobilizing the limb soon after a sprain has been shown to promote healing by stimulating growth factors in musculoskeletal tissues linked to cellular multiplication and matrix remodeling.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The components of an effective rehabilitation program for all sprain injuries include increasing range of motion and progressive muscle strengthening exercise.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Although prolonged immobilization can  have a negative effect on recovery, recent studies suggest that the use of a brace can improve healing by alleviating pain and stabilizing the injury, which helps prevent further damage to the ligament.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Hsu|first=Hunter |last2=Siwiec |first2=Ryan M.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Forearm Splinting |date=2019 |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499980/ |work=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=29763155 |access-date=2019-03-12}}</ref> When using a brace, it is very important to apply the correct amount of pressure, as too much can cause complications.<ref name=\":2\" />

The feature was first identified in the initial image, first published on 8 July 2015, of Pluto returned after the ''[[New Horizons]]'' probe recovered from an anomaly that temporarily sent it into safe mode. NASA initially referred to it as '''the Whale''' in reference to its overall shape.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA's New Horizons: A 'Heart' from Pluto as Flyby Begins|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-new-horizons-a-heart-from-pluto-as-flyby-begins|publisher=NASA|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=8 July 2015}}</ref> By 14 July 2015, the provisional name \"[[Cthulhu]]\" was being used by the ''New Horizons'' team. It was named after the fictional deity from the works of [[H. P.

==Naming==
The feature was first identified in the initial image, first published on 8 July 2015, of Pluto returned after the ''[[New Horizons]]'' probe recovered from an anomaly that temporarily sent it into safe mode. NASA initially referred to it as '''the Whale''' in reference to its overall shape.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA's New Horizons: A 'Heart' from Pluto as Flyby Begins|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-new-horizons-a-heart-from-pluto-as-flyby-begins|publisher=NASA|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=8 July 2015}}</ref> By 14 July 2015, the provisional name \"[[Cthulhu]]\" was being used by the ''New Horizons'' team. It was named after the fictional deity from the works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and others.<ref name=\":0\" /> The character Cthulhu initially appeared in Lovecraft's 1928 short story \"[[The Call of Cthulhu]]\", as a malevolent entity hibernating within [[R'lyeh|an underwater city]] in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. In the book, it is the subject of worship by a number of human cults asserting that while it is currently trapped, Cthulhu will eventually return.<ref name=\"call\">{{cite web |url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Call_of_Cthulhu|title = The Call of Cthulhu|first = H.P|last = Lovecraft|authorlink = H.

Surface features of Pluto are being given provisional, informal names that are selected from a list generated from an online poll conducted earlier in 2015, along the theme of \"creatures related to underworld mythologies.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> \"Cthulhu\" was the most popular name in this category of the poll.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Will HP Lovecraft's deity give his name to a feature on Pluto?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jul/15/pluto-literary-cthulhu-name-features|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 23 July 2015|first = Alison|last = Flood}}</ref> The name received positive reaction from the press and social media,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title = How 'Mordor' and 'Cthulhu' found their way onto Pluto and its moons|url = http://mashable.com/2015/07/16/pluto-charon-mordor-cthulu/|website = Mashable|accessdate = 23 July 2015}}</ref> with a ''Chicago Tribune'' editorial supporting the name and its democratic origin.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tolkien and Lovecraft got spots on Pluto.

''Beware of Dog'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. [[AllMusic]] editor Jason Birchmeier praised the tracks for encapsulating the album with endearing charm in its pop-rap material despite doubting Lil Bow Wow's actual writing credits, concluding that \"All the same, there's no denying the charm and vocal dexterity of Lil Bow Wow, who proves himself genuinely talented, if not exactly a prodigy.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> An editor from ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said that despite Lil Bow Wow's age showing in his lyrics, found potential in his ability to deliver tough lyricism with \"Bow Wow (That's My Name)\" being a great starting point, concluding that \"''Beware of Dog'' is a definite keeper and a trademark to the [[So So Def Recordings|So So Def]] dynasty. This album is clear cut winner in my opinion to potentially be rated for best debut album of the year.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] graded the album as a \"dud\",<ref name=\"Christgau\"/> indicating \"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|year=2000|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php|title=Key to Icons|website=RobertChristgau.com|accessdate=February 5, 2016}}</ref>

==Early life==
Stiles was born on June 20, 1979 in [[Massachusetts]] and was later raised in [[Strafford, New Hampshire]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/playbillcoms-cue-a-sarah-stiles-com-175714 |title=PLAYBILL.COM'S CUE & A: Sarah Stiles |last=Blank |first=Matthew |date=February 1, 2011 |work=[[Playbill]] |publisher=TotalTheater |access-date=August 26, 2018 }}</ref> attending Strafford Elementary School. After middle school, Stiles began her high school career at [[Coe-Brown Northwood Academy]] in New Hampshire.

==Career==
At the age of twelve, Stiles started getting involved with theater productions in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. Her first role was when she played the titular character in ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the Seacoast Repertory Theater. As a teenager, Stiles played two other major roles while living in New Hampshire: [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and [[Cinderella]] in ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''. Stiles loved the performing arts so much that she spent her summers working at the [[Prescott Park (New Hampshire)|Prescott Park]] Arts Festival in Portsmouth.

Before she got involved with Broadway productions, she trained at the [[American Musical and Dramatic Academy]] in New York City. Stiles is known for her two roles in the Off-Broadway production ''Avenue Q'', which is the story of a college student who moves to New York City with big dreams but lives on Avenue Q and has very little money. Stiles plays Kate Monster and Lucy the Slut, who are two [[puppet]]s that she controls throughout the show. 

After Stiles spent much of her time in the production of ''Avenue Q'', she later was offered the role of Joanne in ''Vanities'', a project that Stiles had been involved with for a period of two years. ''Vanities'' was located at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]], but eventually was moved to [[Second Stage Theatre|Second Stage]] in New York. This role in ''Vanities'' eventually led Stiles to be involved in recording an album for the songs.

She played the role of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] in [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]]'s musical ''[[Into the Woods]]'' at the [[Delacorte Theater]] in New York as part of [[Shakespeare in the Park]]. She stars opposite [[Academy Award]] nominee [[Amy Adams]] and [[Tony Award]] winners [[Donna Murphy]] and [[Denis O'Hare]].

In 2017, Stiles appeared in the [[Epix]] television series ''[[Get Shorty (TV series)|Get Shorty]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/get-shorty-sarah-stiles-cast-epix-series-ray-romano-chris-odowd-1201850420/ |title=‘Get Shorty’: Sarah Stiles Joins Cast Of Epix Series |last=Petski |first=Denise |date=November 7, 2016 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]  |access-date=May 16, 2017 }}</ref> Stiles appeared in the 2018 film ''[[Unsane (film)|Unsane]]''.

She appeared in the [[Tootsie (musical)|stage musical]] version of the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' beginning in September 2018, which premiered in Chicago at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from September 11 to October 14, 2018. The musical opened on Broadway in April 2019. In the third season of the Epix television series ''Get Shorty'' Stiles character Gladys, a singer/actress, is cast in the Broadway musical ''Tootsie'' playing the character Stiles actually played in the musical. This plot development allowed Stiles to recreate one of her numbers from the Broadway show on the TV series.

In 2019, Stiles voiced the character of Spinel, the main antagonist from the [[Cartoon Network]] television film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', based on the series ''[[Steven Universe]]''. The performance received high critisizim from audiences and critics and extreme hatred from internet viewers.

==Discography==
Along with having performed on many different stages in various off-Broadway shows, Stiles has found the time to be involved in three different albums for three plays. Her first album recording was singing for the role of Joanne, for the musical, ''Vanities the Musical''. Her second album recording was when she sang the character Nazirah for the musical, ''The Road to Qatar''. Most recently, she can be heard on the album for the musical adaptation of Roald Dahl's ''James and the Giant Peach'' as the Spider. Aside from album recordings, Stiles and her friend Howie have been working on their sketches for their comedy channel on YouTube. The YouTube channel is called Sillyocity, and together, the two of them combine their ideas to make short comedic [[webisode]]s.

==Early life==
Stiles was born on June 20, 1979 in [[Massachusetts]] and was later raised in [[Strafford, New Hampshire]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/playbillcoms-cue-a-sarah-stiles-com-175714 |title=PLAYBILL.COM'S CUE & A: Sarah Stiles |last=Blank |first=Matthew |date=February 1, 2011 |work=[[Playbill]] |publisher=TotalTheater |access-date=August 26, 2018 }}</ref> attending Strafford Elementary School. After middle school, Stiles began her high school career at [[Coe-Brown Northwood Academy]] in New Hampshire.

==Career==
At the age of twelve, Stiles started getting involved with theater productions in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. Her first role was when she played the titular character in ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the Seacoast Repertory Theater. As a teenager, Stiles played two other major roles while living in New Hampshire: [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and [[Cinderella]] in ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''. Stiles loved the performing arts so much that she spent her summers working at the [[Prescott Park (New Hampshire)|Prescott Park]] Arts Festival in Portsmouth.

Before she got involved with Broadway productions, she trained at the [[American Musical and Dramatic Academy]] in New York City. Stiles is known for her two roles in the Off-Broadway production ''Avenue Q'', which is the story of a college student who moves to New York City with big dreams but lives on Avenue Q and has very little money. Stiles plays Kate Monster and Lucy the Slut, who are two [[puppet]]s that she controls throughout the show. 

After Stiles spent much of her time in the production of ''Avenue Q'', she later was offered the role of Joanne in ''Vanities'', a project that Stiles had been involved with for a period of two years. ''Vanities'' was located at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]], but eventually was moved to [[Second Stage Theatre|Second Stage]] in New York. This role in ''Vanities'' eventually led Stiles to be involved in recording an album for the songs.

She played the role of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] in [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]]'s musical ''[[Into the Woods]]'' at the [[Delacorte Theater]] in New York as part of [[Shakespeare in the Park]]. She stars opposite [[Academy Award]] nominee [[Amy Adams]] and [[Tony Award]] winners [[Donna Murphy]] and [[Denis O'Hare]].

In 2017, Stiles appeared in the [[Epix]] television series ''[[Get Shorty (TV series)|Get Shorty]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/get-shorty-sarah-stiles-cast-epix-series-ray-romano-chris-odowd-1201850420/ |title=‘Get Shorty’: Sarah Stiles Joins Cast Of Epix Series |last=Petski |first=Denise |date=November 7, 2016 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]  |access-date=May 16, 2017 }}</ref> Stiles appeared in the 2018 film ''[[Unsane (film)|Unsane]]''.

She appeared in the [[Tootsie (musical)|stage musical]] version of the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' beginning in September 2018, which premiered in Chicago at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from September 11 to October 14, 2018. The musical opened on Broadway in April 2019. In the third season of the Epix television series ''Get Shorty'' Stiles character Gladys, a singer/actress, is cast in the Broadway musical ''Tootsie'' playing the character Stiles actually played in the musical. This plot development allowed Stiles to recreate one of her numbers from the Broadway show on the TV series.

In 2019, Stiles voiced the character of Spinel, the main antagonist from the [[Cartoon Network]] television film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', based on the series ''[[Steven Universe]]''. The performance received high praise from audiences and critics.

==Discography==
Along with having performed on many different stages in various off-Broadway shows, Stiles has found the time to be involved in three different albums for three plays. Her first album recording was singing for the role of Joanne, for the musical, ''Vanities the Musical''. Her second album recording was when she sang the character Nazirah for the musical, ''The Road to Qatar''. Most recently, she can be heard on the album for the musical adaptation of Roald Dahl's ''James and the Giant Peach'' as the Spider. Aside from album recordings, Stiles and her friend Howie have been working on their sketches for their comedy channel on YouTube. The YouTube channel is called Sillyocity, and together, the two of them combine their ideas to make short comedic [[webisode]]s.

'''Mad Housers, Inc.''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit corporation]] based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and engaged in [[Charity (practice)|charitable work]], research and education. The Mad Housers are perhaps best known for a hands-on, pragmatic approach to providing shelter to [[homelessness|homeless]] people, in particular through the design, construction and provision of small (6'x8'x10') [https://web.archive.org/web/20071124102705/http://www.madhousers.org/shelter.shtml frame-and-plywood huts]. These shelters, though not meant as permanent housing, provide \"privacy, security, protection from the elements, and stability,\" all of which the organization believes are vital to helping people escape homelessness. Unlike the \"[[sweat equity]]\" required by which some housing programs such as [[Habitat for Humanity]] (where inhabitants are required to take part in the construction of their future dwelling), Mad Houser shelters are provided free of any charge or obligation to their inhabitants. The name \"Mad Housers\" came from the [[Mad Bomber]] in New York.  The idea was that he struck in secret, just as they came in secret to erect huts for the homeless.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\">Personal Interview: Bailey Pope and Brian Finkle 2007-11-20</ref>

== Early history (1987&ndash;1992) ==

The Mad Housers first emerged in 1987, founded by graduate students, Michael Connor and Brian Finkel, of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech's College of Architecture]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070909163219/http://other90.cooperhewitt.org/design/mad-housers-hut] Mad Housers Hut. Design for the Other 90%. Retrieved on 2007-08-03.</ref>  to address the problem of homelessness in Atlanta.  Their first projects were based on their vision of improving upon other types of marginal housing being erected for the homeless.  Even in the early years, the group grew, changed and progressed in physical hut design, group organization and their methods of operation.

Based on their research and plans, Connor, Finkel and three other architecture students built the first hut.<ref name=\"Anderson\">Anderson, Kristine F. \"`Mad Housers' Deliver Shelter for the Homeless :[Orange County Edition]. \" Los Angeles Times (pre-1997 Fulltext)  [Los Angeles, Calif.] 20  Jul 1989,8. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  It was a small 6' by 8' by 6' plywood box \"outfitted with a bed and shelves for [the client's] belongings\".<ref name=\"AJC\">\"Raising the Roof to Aid the Homeless.\" Atlanta Journal Constitution.  15 March 1988:  A,16. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  However, it was dry and kept \"out the wind and the rain.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  This first experiment at housing the homeless was different than their later attempts: they built the house at a particular location and left it there to see what would happen.  After two days, someone had claimed the house, moved it to a more concealed location and \"reassembled [it] more practically than the prototype\".<ref name=\"AJC\" />  The group no longer builds haphazardly like this though.  They \"select clients beforehand, making sure they actually want huts and usually getting them to assist in construction\".<ref name=\"Newsweek\">\"A Holiday for Heroes.\" Newsweek.  4 July 1988:  34. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  They also try to choose their build sites based on where the homeless already live.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  In the philosophical terminology of [[Martin Heidegger]], dwelling precedes building.  The group also became much more efficient in just their first year.  They were able to erect a hut in just 20 minutes and began to use salvaged materials to build the huts \"cutting the cost from 'the $200 [they] spent on the first hut to $25 to $40 each'\".<ref name=\"AJC\" />

== Inspiration ==

The Mad Housers first began their work with no political motives.  They were only concerned about the plight of the homeless in Atlanta.  Seeing a homeless shelter called \"The Center\" on the corner of Peachtree and Pine made the plight of the homeless real to Finkle and changed the course of Connor's research leading to the creation of the Mad Housers.  The group was also \"completely non-denominational – it was not born out of spirituality.\"  Pope emphasized the primary mission of the group was to help give the clients a home, not to convert them.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\"/>

== Media and public perception ==

The way in which the media treated the Mad Housers in the early years is very interesting.  The newspaper and magazine articles of the late 1980s tended to emphasize the secretive nature of the organization describing them as \"guerilla hut-builders\",<ref name=\"Morris\">Morris, Holly. \"Atlanta Group's Tents with Privacy Are Big Hit with Hurricane Victims. \" The Atlanta Constitution  [Atlanta, Ga.] 1  Oct. 1992,A3.  National Newspapers (27). Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref> a \"secret society of sorts,\" and having \"the air of a fraternity prank\".<ref name=\"AJC\" />  This image of secrecy was in fact an integral component of the organization for the first couple years.  One Mad Houser explained in a newspaper article, \"secrecy was necessary […] to avoid arrest and prevent the Georgia Department of Transportation […] from tearing them down\".<ref name=\"Morris\" />  Today, they are not quite as furtive, but they do still try to remain under the radar for the most part to protect their clients.  After the first couple years of absolute secrecy, they began to come into the open and to attract the attention of various media groups and other organizations.

Their site on Techwood was a turning point in their level of exposure. Although the site was difficult to get to, it was visible from the interstate and brought the media into contact with the Mad Housers.  One day, a fight broke out between the residents and one person was knifed.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  The Department of Transportation, who owned the land, decided that it was an unacceptable risk to allow the huts to remain.  A debate ensued among the Mad Housers as to what to do about the situation.  Pope wanted to go to the media and publicize the injustice of kicking the people out.  However, they ended up following Finkel's suggestion to not make a big deal out of it and simply move the huts somewhere safe.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  In July 1988, they participated in a demonstration for the homeless at the [[Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"Morris\" />  Since then, they have continued to bring \"the plight of the homeless to public attention\".<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  Then, in 1990, an hour-long documentary aired on 90 TV stations around the nation dramatizing the Mad Houser's work.<ref name=\"Krasner\">Krasner, Mike. \"'The Mad Housers' grapples with issue of homelessness :[ALL Edition]. \" Telegram & Gazette  [Worcester, Mass.] 28  Mar. 1990, D5. ABI/INFORM Trade & Industry. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  However Bailey Pope, one of the founders, said that this documentary is not a very accurate representation of the organization.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />

However, the problem with the increasing amount of public exposure was the fact that their work is technically illegal.  There have been several occasions when city officials and the Department of Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Affairs have torn down huts considering them \"infractions of the law\".<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  Important city events such as the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]] (and presumably the [[1996 Olympics]]) also created tension between the city and the Mad Housers by clearing out several sites.<ref name=\"LeeMay\">May, Lee. \"Almost Homeless: `Mad Housing' in Atlanta Their volunteer-built shacks are in hidden spots but hut-dwellers fear they are living on borrowed time :[Home Edition]. \" Los Angeles Times (pre-1997 Fulltext)  [Los Angeles, Calif.] 18  Jun 1990,5. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  However, the Mad Housers were able to reach an \"informal alliance with local officials and the city police\".<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  As one article pointed out, \"the mayors seem to have realized these are not normal times. We can't deal in niceties and fine points here\".<ref name=\"UPI\">\"Homeless Group Vows too Face Bulldozer.\" United Press International  25 May 1992:  BC Cycle. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  In a [[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]] interview, [[Atlanta]]'s [[Andrew Young|mayor]] said that the Mad Housers perform \"the kind of civil disobedience I can get behind\"<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" /> making a reference to [[Thoreau]].  In 1989, the mayor promised them a $30,000 grant, but the group had trouble obtaining the tax exempt status required for them to accept the grant.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  By 2002, they had achieved [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status, and were able to work the situation out.<ref name=\"MHYahoo\">Mad Housers Yahoo Group: https://groups.yahoo.com/group/madhousers 1 April 2002</ref>

== Recent history ==

The organization had a major shift in the mid-90s as some of the original Mad Housers left the group for various reasons such as graduating or moving away and the next generation of volunteers joined.  Another factor contributing to the lull in the group's activity was the [[1996 Olympics]] when most of the homeless in Atlanta were removed from the city.  Pope said that the group became more focused on maintaining the current huts.  While they still built huts, they \"became more of a [[landlord]] than a development organization.\"  Frank Jeffers, a longtime member and president of the organization for many years helped develop items such as a [[cogeneration]] power generator out of a lawnmower and a wood stove to heat the huts.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />
Today the Mad Housers are still very active in providing shelter for the homeless and have panel builds and hut raisings regularly.  They also do site recon trips to find new sites and \"[[winterization]]\" of the huts when they prepare the huts for the impending cold weather.  In 2002, to raise awareness about homelessness in Atlanta, they built a hut on the [[Georgia Tech]] campus and slept in it that night.<ref name=\"MHYahoo\" />

== Phenomenology of the huts ==

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], as described by David Seamon, \"seeks to understand how people live in relation to everyday places, spaces, and environments.\" <ref name=\"Seamon\">Seamon, David. \"Body Subject, Time-Space Routines, and Place-Ballets\"</ref>  This concept certainly applies to the clients of the Mad Housers.  Multiple accounts describe how the clients interact with their new space and repurpose it.  The clients were skeptical at first about whether it was too good to be true, but once they were convinced, they were very enthusiastic about their new homes.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  Several articles mention how the clients arrange their personal possessions in their hut with special significance because they did not have that luxury before.<ref name=\"AJC\" /><ref name=\"Anderson2\">Anderson, Kristine F. \"A Hut Resident and a Mad Houser Coordinator.\" The Christian Science Monitor  14  June 1989,13. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  Having a hut is a transformational experience for the clients.  One hut dweller said \"the power of a hut is what it does for your self-esteem. In a shelter, you can't make someone a cup of instant coffee, invite them in, ask them if they read this article or this book. When you have a hut, you can say, 'This is my place.\"<ref name=\"Progressive\">\"The Power of the Hut. \" The Progressive  1 November 1992:  13. Research Library. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  Another client said, \"It's a lot more than shelter, It's a sense of dignity, a sense of space, and a sense of privacy.\"<ref name=\"Morris\" />  Also according to Pope, having huts gave the residents political stature.  The communities were given police and sanitation service.  Pope realized the extent to which the huts were transformational when he saw one of the clients sitting on his porch watching the sunset.  Pope said the man \"couldn't have been happier.\"<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />

'''Mad Housers, Inc.''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit corporation]] based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and engaged in [[Charity (practice)|charitable work]], research and education. The Mad Housers are perhaps best known for a hands-on, pragmatic approach to providing shelter to [[homelessness|homeless]] people, in particular through the design, construction and provision of small (6'x8'x10') [https://web.archive.org/web/20071124102705/http://www.madhousers.org/shelter.shtml frame-and-plywood huts]. These shelters, though not meant as permanent housing, provide \"privacy, security, protection from the elements, and stability,\" all of which the organization believes are vital to helping people escape homelessness. Unlike the \"[[sweat equity]]\" required by which some housing programs such as [[Habitat for Humanity]] (where inhabitants are required to take part in the construction of their future dwelling), Mad Houser shelters are provided free of any charge or obligation to their inhabitants. The name \"Mad Housers\" came from the [[Mad Bomber]] in New York.  The idea was that he struck in secret, just as they came in secret to erect huts for the homeless.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\">Personal Interview: Bailey Pope and Brian Finkle 2007-11-20</ref>

== Early history (1987&ndash;1992) ==

The Mad Housers first emerged in 1987, founded by graduate students, Michael Connor and Brian Finkel, of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech's College of Architecture]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070909163219/http://other90.cooperhewitt.org/design/mad-housers-hut] Mad Housers Hut. Design for the Other 90%. Retrieved on 2007-08-03.</ref>  to address the problem of homelessness in Atlanta.  Their first projects were based on their vision of improving upon other types of marginal housing being erected for the homeless.  Even in the early years, the group grew, changed and progressed in physical hut design, group organization and their methods of operation.

Based on their research and plans, Connor, Finkel and three other architecture students built the first hut.<ref name=\"Anderson\">Anderson, Kristine F. \"`Mad Housers' Deliver Shelter for the Homeless :[Orange County Edition]. \" Los Angeles Times (pre-1997 Fulltext)  [Los Angeles, Calif.] 20  Jul 1989,8. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  It was a small 6' by 8' by 6' plywood box \"outfitted with a bed and shelves for [the client's] belongings\".<ref name=\"AJC\">\"Raising the Roof to Aid the Homeless.\" Atlanta Journal Constitution.  15 March 1988:  A,16. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  However, it was dry and kept \"out the wind and the rain.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  This first experiment at housing the homeless was different than their later attempts: they built the house at a particular location and left it there to see what would happen.  After two days, someone had claimed the house, moved it to a more concealed location and \"reassembled [it] more practically than the prototype\".<ref name=\"AJC\" />  The group no longer builds haphazardly like this though.  They \"select clients beforehand, making sure they actually want huts and usually getting them to assist in construction\".<ref name=\"Newsweek\">\"A Holiday for Heroes.\" Newsweek.  4 July 1988:  34. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  They also try to choose their build sites based on where the homeless already live.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  In the philosophical terminology of [[Martin Heidegger]], dwelling precedes building.  The group also became much more efficient in just their first year.  They were able to erect a hut in just 20 minutes and began to use salvaged materials to build the huts \"cutting the cost from 'the $200 [they] spent on the first hut to $25 to $40 each'\".<ref name=\"AJC\" />

== Inspiration ==

The Mad Housers first began their work with no political motives.  They were only concerned about the plight of the homeless in Atlanta.  Seeing a homeless shelter called \"The Center\" on the corner of Peachtree and Pine made the plight of the homeless real to Finkle and changed the course of Connor's research leading to the creation of the Mad Housers.  The group was also \"completely non-denominational – it was not born out of spirituality.\"  Pope emphasized the primary mission of the group was to help give the clients a home, not to convert them.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\"/>

== Media and public perception ==

The way in which the media treated the Mad Housers in the early years is very interesting.  The newspaper and magazine articles of the late 1980s tended to emphasize the secretive nature of the organization describing them as \"guerilla hut-builders\",<ref name=\"Morris\">Morris, Holly. \"Atlanta Group's Tents with Privacy Are Big Hit with Hurricane Victims. \" The Atlanta Constitution  [Atlanta, Ga.] 1  Oct. 1992,A3.  National Newspapers (27). Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref> a \"secret society of sorts,\" and having \"the air of a fraternity prank\".<ref name=\"AJC\" />  This image of secrecy was in fact an integral component of the organization for the first couple years.  One Mad Houser explained in a newspaper article, \"secrecy was necessary […] to avoid arrest and prevent the Georgia Department of Transportation […] from tearing them down\".<ref name=\"Morris\" />  Today, they are not quite as furtive, but they do still try to remain under the radar for the most part to protect their clients.  After the first couple years of absolute secrecy, they began to come into the open and to attract the attention of various media groups and other organizations.

Their site on Techwood was a turning point in their level of exposure. Although the site was difficult to get to, it was visible from the interstate and brought the media into contact with the Mad Housers.  One day, a fight broke out between the residents and one person was knifed.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  The Department of Transportation, who owned the land, decided that it was an unacceptable risk to allow the huts to remain.  A debate ensued among the Mad Housers as to what to do about the situation.  Pope wanted to go to the media and publicize the injustice of kicking the people out.  However, they ended up following Finkel's suggestion to not make a big deal out of it and simply move the huts somewhere safe.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  In July 1988, they participated in a demonstration for the homeless at the [[Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"Morris\" />  Since then, they have continued to bring \"the plight of the homeless to public attention\".<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  Then, in 1990, an hour-long documentary aired on 90 TV stations around the nation dramatizing the Mad Houser's work.<ref name=\"Krasner\">Krasner, Mike. \"'The Mad Housers' grapples with issue of homelessness :[ALL Edition]. \" Telegram & Gazette  [Worcester, Mass.] 28  Mar. 1990, D5. ABI/INFORM Trade & Industry. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  However Bailey Pope, one of the founders, said that this documentary is not a very accurate representation of the organization.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />

However, the problem with the increasing amount of public exposure was the fact that their work is technically illegal.  There have been several occasions when city officials and the Department of Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Affairs have torn down huts considering them \"infractions of the law\".<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  Important city events such as the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]] (and presumably the [[1996 Olympics]]) also created tension between the city and the Mad Housers by clearing out several sites.<ref name=\"LeeMay\">May, Lee. \"Almost Homeless: `Mad Housing' in Atlanta Their volunteer-built shacks are in hidden spots but hut-dwellers fear they are living on borrowed time :[Home Edition]. \" Los Angeles Times (pre-1997 Fulltext)  [Los Angeles, Calif.] 18  Jun 1990,5. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  However, the Mad Housers were able to reach an \"informal alliance with local officials and the city police\".<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  As one article pointed out, \"the mayors seem to have realized these are not normal times. We can't deal in niceties and fine points here\".<ref name=\"UPI\">\"Homeless Group Vows too Face Bulldozer.\" United Press International  25 May 1992:  BC Cycle. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  In a [[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]] interview, [[Atlanta]]'s [[Andrew Young|mayor]] said that the Mad Housers perform \"the kind of civil disobedience I can get behind\"<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" /> making a reference to [[Thoreau]].  In 1989, the mayor promised them a $30,000 grant, but the group had trouble obtaining the tax exempt status required for them to accept the grant.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />  By 2002, they had achieved [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status, and were able to work the situation out.<ref name=\"MHYahoo\">Mad Housers Yahoo Group: https://groups.yahoo.com/group/madhousers 1 April 2002</ref>

== Recent history ==

The organization had a major shift in the mid-90s as some of the original Mad Housers left the group for various reasons such as graduating or moving away and the next generation of volunteers joined.  Another factor contributing to the lull in the group's activity was the [[1996 Olympics]] when most of the homeless in Atlanta were removed from the city.  Pope said that the group became more focused on maintaining the current huts.  While they still built huts, they \"became more of a [[landlord]] than a development organization.\"  Frank Jeffers, a longtime member and president of the organization for many years helped develop items such as a [[cogeneration]] power generator out of a lawnmower and a wood stove to heat the huts.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />
Today the Mad Housers are still very active in providing shelter for the homeless and have panel builds and hut raisings regularly.  They also do site recon trips to find new sites and \"[[winterization]]\" of the huts when they prepare the huts for the impending cold weather.  In 2002, to raise awareness about homelessness in Atlanta, they built a hut on the [[Georgia Tech]] campus and slept in it that night.<ref name=\"MHYahoo\" />

== Phenomenology of the huts ==

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], as described by David Seamon, \"seeks to understand how people live in relation to everyday places, spaces, and environments.\" <ref name=\"Seamon\">Seamon, David. \"Body Subject, Time-Space Routines, and Place-Ballets\"</ref>  This concept certainly applies to the clients of the Mad Housers.  Multiple accounts describe how the clients interact with their new space and repurpose it.  The clients were skeptical at first about whether it was too good to be true, but once they were convinced, they were very enthusiastic about their new homes.<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />  Several articles mention how the clients arrange their personal possessions in their hut with special significance because they did not have that luxury before.<ref name=\"AJC\" /><ref name=\"Anderson2\">Anderson, Kristine F. \"A Hut Resident and a Mad Houser Coordinator.\" The Christian Science Monitor  14  June 1989,13. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  Having a hut is a transformational experience for the clients.  One hut dweller said \"the power of a hut is what it does for your self-esteem. In a shelter, you can't make someone a cup of instant coffee, invite them in, ask them if they read this article or this book. When you have a hut, you can say, 'This is my place.\"<ref name=\"Progressive\">\"The Power of the Hut. \" The Progressive  1 November 1992:  13. Research Library. Retrieved 2007-09-20.</ref>  Another client said, \"It's a lot more than shelter, It's a sense of dignity, a sense of space, and a sense of privacy.\"<ref name=\"Morris\" />  Also according to Pope, having huts gave the residents political stature.  The communities were given police and sanitation service.  Pope realized the extent to which the huts were transformational when he saw one of the clients sitting on his porch watching the sunset.  Pope said the man \"couldn't have been happier.\"<ref name=\"PopeFinkleInt\" />

The '''Teapot Dome scandal''' was a [[bribery]] scandal involving the administration of United States President [[Warren G. Harding]] from 1921 to 1923. [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Albert Bacon Fall]] had leased [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[petroleum]] reserves at [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome]] in [[Wyoming]], and two locations in [[California]], to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding. The leases were the subject of a seminal investigation by Senator [[Thomas J. Walsh]]. Convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies, Fall became the first [[Cabinet of the United States|presidential cabinet]] member to go to prison; no one was convicted of paying the bribes.

==History==
[[File:Teapot Rock postcard crop.jpg|thumb|Teapot Dome around the time of the scandal, featuring Teapot Rock (from postcard c. 1922)]]

In the early 20th century, the U.S. Navy largely converted from [[coal]] to [[fuel oil]]. To ensure that the Navy would always have enough fuel available, several oil-producing areas were designated as naval oil reserves by [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]]. In 1921, President Harding issued an [[executive order]] that transferred control of [[Teapot Rock|Teapot Dome Oil Field]] in [[Natrona County, Wyoming]], and the [[Elk Hills Oil Field|Elk Hills]] and [[Buena Vista Oil Field]]s in [[Kern County, California]], from the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. This was not implemented until 1922, when Interior Secretary Fall persuaded [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Edwin Denby (politician)|Edwin C. Denby]] to transfer control.

Later in 1922, Interior Secretary Albert Fall leased the oil production rights at Teapot Dome to [[Harry Ford Sinclair|Harry F. Sinclair]] of Mammoth Oil, a subsidiary of [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]]. He also leased the Elk Hills reserve to [[Edward L. Doheny]] of [[Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company]]. Both leases were issued without competitive bidding. This manner of leasing was legal under the [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ut/vernal_fo/lands___minerals.Par.6287.File.dat/MineralLeasingAct1920.pdf | title= Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 as Amended (re-transcribed 2007-08-07) | publisher= Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior | accessdate=2014-09-08 }}</ref>

The lease terms were very favorable to the oil companies, which secretly made Fall a rich man. Fall had received a no-interest loan from Doheny of $100,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|100000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn |US}}) in November 1921. He received other gifts from Doheny and Sinclair totaling about $404,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|404000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn|US}}). This money changing hands was illegal, not the leases. Fall attempted to keep his actions secret, but the sudden improvement in his standard of living was suspect.

==Investigation and outcome==
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}
In April 1922, a Wyoming oil operator wrote to his Senator, [[John B. Kendrick]], angered that Sinclair had been given a contract to the lands in a secret deal. Kendrick did not respond, but two days later on April 15, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the deal.<ref>{{cite book | author = Davis, Margaret L | title= Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L.

La Follette Sr.]] of [[Wisconsin]] led an investigation by the Senate Committee on Public Lands. At first, La Follette believed Fall was innocent. However, his suspicions were aroused after his own office in the [[Senate Office Building]] was ransacked.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Investigates_the_Teapot_Dome_Scandal.htm|title=Senate Investigates the \"Teapot Dome\" Scandal |work= Historical Minutes: 1921–1940|publisher=Art & History, United States Senate}}</ref>

[[File:Albert B. Fall with map background.jpg|thumb|[[Albert B. Fall]] was the first U.S. cabinet official sentenced to prison.]]

Democrat [[Thomas J. Walsh]] of [[Montana]], the most junior minority member, led a lengthy inquiry. For two years, Walsh pushed forward while Fall stepped backward, covering his tracks as he went. No evidence of wrongdoing was initially uncovered, as the leases were legal enough, but records kept disappearing mysteriously. Fall had made the leases appear legitimate, but his acceptance of the money was his undoing. By 1924, the remaining unanswered question was how Fall had become so rich so quickly and easily.

Money from the bribes had gone to Fall's cattle ranch and investments in his business. Finally, as the investigation was winding down with Fall apparently innocent, Walsh uncovered a piece of evidence Fall had failed to cover up: Doheny's $100,000 loan to Fall. This discovery broke open the scandal. Civil and criminal suits related to the scandal continued throughout the 1920s. In 1927, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained. The Court invalidated the Elk Hills lease in February 1927, and the Teapot Dome lease in October. Both reserves were returned to the Navy.<ref name=revenues/>

In 1929, Fall was found guilty of accepting bribes from Doheny. Conversely, in 1930, Doheny was acquitted of paying bribes to Fall. Further, Doheny's corporation foreclosed on Fall's home in [[Tularosa Basin]], New Mexico, because of \"unpaid loans\" that turned out to be that same $100,000 bribe. Sinclair served six months in jail on a charge of [[jury tampering]].<ref>{{cite book |last=McCartney |first=Laton |title=The Teapot Dome Scandal: How Big Oil Bought the Harding White House and Tried to Steal the Country |location=New York |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4000-6316-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/teapotdomescanda00mcca }}</ref>

Although Fall was to blame for this scandal, Harding's reputation was sullied because of his involvement with the wrong people. Evidence proving Fall's guilt only arose after Harding's death in 1923.<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Scott B.|last2=Hughes|first2=Jane E.|title=Separating Fools from Their Money: A History of American Financial Scandals|orig-year=1st pub. 2007|publisher=Transaction|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=978-0-7658-0356-6|date=2015|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/separat_mac_2007_00_2620}}</ref>

Another significant outcome was the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[McGrain v. Daugherty]]'' (1927) which, for the first time, explicitly established that [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] had the power to compel testimony.<ref name=\"oyez\">{{Cite web | title = McGrain v.

The oil field was then idled for 49 years, but went back into production in 1976. After earning over $569 million in revenue having extracted {{convert|22|e6oilbbl|lk=in}} of oil over the previous 39 years, in February 2015, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] sold the oil field for $45 million to New York-based Stranded Oil Resources Corp.<ref name=revenues>[http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/30/government-sells-scandalized-teapot-dome-oilfield-for-45-million Government sells scandalized Teapot Dome oilfield for $45 million], ''[[Denver Post]]'', [[Associated Press]]'', January 30, 2015.

==Comparison==

The Teapot Dome scandal has historically been regarded as the worst such scandal in the United States – the \"[[high water mark]]\" of cabinet corruption. It is often used as a benchmark for comparison with subsequent scandals. In particular it has been compared to the [[Watergate scandal]], in which a cabinet member, Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], went to prison, the second time in American history that a member of cabinet has been incarcerated.<ref>{{cite book|title=Watergate & the Teapot Dome Scandal: The History and Legacy of America's Most Notorious Government Scandals|date=November 2, 2016|publisher=Charles River Editors |edition=Kindle |asin=B01N9IMB2P}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Uncovering a Coverup on Teapot Dome|last=Roberts|first=Chalmers M.|date=June 9, 1977|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

Later in 1922, Interior Secretary Albert Fall leased the oil production rights at Teapot Dome to [[Harry Ford Sinclair|Harry F. Sinclair]] of Mammoth Oil, a subsidiary of [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]]. He also leased the Elk Hills reserve to [[Edward L. Doheny]] of [[Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company]]. Both leases were issued without competitive bidding. This manner of leasing was legal under the [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ut/vernal_fo/lands___minerals.Par.6287.File.dat/MineralLeasingAct1920.pdf | title= Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 as Amended (re-transcribed 2007-08-07) | publisher= Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior | accessdate=2014-09-08 }}</ref>

The lease terms were very favorable to the oil companies, which secretly made Fall a rich man. Fall had received a no-interest loan from Doheny of $100,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|100000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn |US}}) in November 1921. He received other gifts from Doheny and Sinclair totaling about $404,000 (about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|404000|1921}}}} today{{inflation-fn|US}}). This money changing hands was illegal, not the leases. Fall attempted to keep his actions secret, but the sudden improvement in his standard of living was suspect.

==Investigation and outcome==
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}
In April 1922, a Wyoming oil operator wrote to his Senator, [[John B. Kendrick]], angered that Sinclair had been given a contract to the lands in a secret deal. Kendrick did not respond, but two days later on April 15, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the deal.<ref>{{cite book | author = Davis, Margaret L | title= Dark Side of Fortune: Triumph and Scandal in the Life of Oil Tycoon Edward L.

La Follette Sr.]] of [[Wisconsin]] led an investigation by the Senate Committee on Public Lands. At first, La Follette believed Fall was innocent. However, his suspicions were aroused after his own office in the [[Senate Office Building]] was ransacked.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Investigates_the_Teapot_Dome_Scandal.htm|title=Senate Investigates the \"Teapot Dome\" Scandal |work= Historical Minutes: 1921–1940|publisher=Art & History, United States Senate}}</ref>

[[File:Albert B. Fall with map background.jpg|thumb|[[Albert B. Fall]] was the first U.S. cabinet official sentenced to prison.]]

Democrat [[Thomas J. Walsh]] of [[Montana]], the most junior minority member, led a lengthy inquiry. For two years, Walsh pushed forward while Fall stepped backward, covering his tracks as he went. No evidence of wrongdoing was initially uncovered, as the leases were legal enough, but records kept disappearing mysteriously. Fall had made the leases appear legitimate, but his acceptance of the money was his undoing. By 1924, the remaining unanswered question was how Fall had become so rich so quickly and easily.

Money from the bribes had gone to Fall's cattle ranch and investments in his business. Finally, as the investigation was winding down with Fall apparently innocent, Walsh uncovered a piece of evidence Fall had failed to cover up: Doheny's $100,000 loan to Fall. This discovery broke open the scandal. Civil and criminal suits related to the scandal continued throughout the 1920s. In 1927, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained. The Court invalidated the Elk Hills lease in February 1927, and the Teapot Dome lease in October. Both reserves were returned to the Navy.<ref name=revenues/>

In 1929, Fall was found guilty of accepting bribes from Doheny. Conversely, in 1930, Doheny was acquitted of paying bribes to Fall. Further, Doheny's corporation foreclosed on Fall's home in [[Tularosa Basin]], New Mexico, because of \"unpaid loans\" that turned out to be that same $100,000 bribe. Sinclair served six months in jail on a charge of [[jury tampering]].<ref>{{cite book |last=McCartney |first=Laton |title=The Teapot Dome Scandal: How Big Oil Bought the Harding White House and Tried to Steal the Country |location=New York |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4000-6316-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/teapotdomescanda00mcca }}</ref>

Although Fall was to blame for this scandal, Harding's reputation was sullied because of his involvement with the wrong people. Evidence proving Fall's guilt only arose after Harding's death in 1923.<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Scott B.|last2=Hughes|first2=Jane E.|title=Separating Fools from Their Money: A History of American Financial Scandals|orig-year=1st pub. 2007|publisher=Transaction|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=978-0-7658-0356-6|date=2015|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/separat_mac_2007_00_2620}}</ref>

Another significant outcome was the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[McGrain v. Daugherty]]'' (1927) which, for the first time, explicitly established that [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] had the power to compel testimony.<ref name=\"oyez\">{{Cite web | title = McGrain v.

The oil field was then idled for 49 years, but went back into production in 1976. After earning over $569 million in revenue having extracted {{convert|22|e6oilbbl|lk=in}} of oil over the previous 39 years, in February 2015, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] sold the oil field for $45 million to New York-based Stranded Oil Resources Corp.<ref name=revenues>[http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/30/government-sells-scandalized-teapot-dome-oilfield-for-45-million Government sells scandalized Teapot Dome oilfield for $45 million], ''[[Denver Post]]'', [[Associated Press]]'', January 30, 2015.

==Comparison==

The Teapot Dome scandal has historically been regarded as the worst such scandal in the United States – the \"[[high water mark]]\" of cabinet corruption. It is often used as a benchmark for comparison with subsequent scandals. In particular it has been compared to the [[Watergate scandal]], in which a cabinet member, Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], went to prison, the second time in American history that a member of cabinet has been incarcerated.<ref>{{cite book|title=Watergate & the Teapot Dome Scandal: The History and Legacy of America's Most Notorious Government Scandals|date=November 2, 2016|publisher=Charles River Editors |edition=Kindle |asin=B01N9IMB2P}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Uncovering a Coverup on Teapot Dome|last=Roberts|first=Chalmers M.|date=June 9, 1977|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

'''Manicaland''' is a [[Provinces of Zimbabwe|province]] in eastern [[Zimbabwe]]. After [[Harare Province]], it is the country's second-most populous province, with a population of 1.75 million, as of the [[2012 Zimbabwe census|2012 census]]. After Harare and [[Bulawayo]] provinces, it is Zimbabwe's third-most densely populated province. Manicaland was one of five original provinces established in [[Southern Rhodesia]] in the early colonial period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepatriot.co.zw/old_posts/changing-the-names-of-provinces/|title=Changing the names of provinces|last=Chakamwe|first=Chakamwe|date=2014-05-01|website=The Patriot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}</ref> The province is divided into ten administrative subdivisions of seven rural districts and three towns/councils, including the provincial capital, [[Mutare]]. The name Manicaland is derived from the province's largest ethnic group, the [[Manyika tribe|Manyika]], a [[Shona people|Shona]] subgroup who speak a distinct [[Shona language|Shona]] dialect, [[Manyika dialect|Manyika]].

Manicaland is bordered by [[Mashonaland East Province]] to the northwest, [[Midlands Province]] to the west, [[Masvingo Province]] to the southwest, and [[Mozambique]] to the east. It has an area of {{convert|36,459|km2|mi2}},<ref>[http://www.geohive.com/cntry/zimbabwe.aspx Surface Area of Manicaland District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217021255/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/zimbabwe.aspx|date=2013-12-17}}</ref> equal to 9.28% of the total area of Zimbabwe. It is the sixth-largest in area of Zimbabwe's ten provinces. Its economy is largely centered around [[industry]] and [[agriculture]], particularly [[manufacturing]], [[diamond]] and [[gold]] mining, [[Lumber|timber]], [[tea]] and [[coffee]] plantations, and [[tourism]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialgazette.co.zw/manicaland-industries-collapse/|title=Manicaland industries collapse|last=Matimaire|first=Kenneth|date=2017-03-23|work=The Financial Gazette|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}</ref> In recent years, Manicaland's economy has declined as [[manufacturing]] firms and mines continue to fold,<ref name=\":0\" /> and the province now lags behind other Zimbabwean provinces economically and developmentally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestandard.co.zw/2012/11/18/manicaland-is-also-for-devolution/|title=Manicaland is also for devolution|last=Zimunya|first=Itai|date=2012-11-18|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name Manicaland derives from the fact that the area has been occupied in recent history by the [[Manyika]] people. The Manyika are a [[Shona people|Shona]] sub-tribal grouping with their own language variant, the [[Manyika language]].

Manicaland is the second most populated province in Zimbabwe. It has a population of about 1,755,000 which constitutes about 13.5% of the country's total population.

The people of Manicaland speak [[Shona language|Shona]], but different districts have own sub-dialects. For example, [[Mutasa District]] uses the [[Manyika]] sub-dialect. In [[Makoni District]], the people use the [[Maungwe]] dialect, [[Chipinge]], the [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and [[Mutare]], the [[Bocha dialect|Bocha]] and [[Jindwi]] dialects.

A great number of the population practise their own traditional way of worshipping, but many also practice [[Christianity]] (about 65%). The majority falling under the traditional churches: [[Methodist Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Anglican Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The Pentecostal churches have large followings in the urban areas of Mutare and a few other growth points. Some gatherings fall under the Apostolic Churches, with a notably higher proportion of the Apostolic followers in Mutare and Buhera district. Polygamy is quite prevalent among church members.

==Schools in Manicaland==
Manicaland boasts of some of the best performing schools in the country{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. Schools such as St Augastines (Tsambe), '''St Faith's School, Rusape'''  (Fisco-'Madetere') (Currently the best performing school 2012 at 'O' level and 'A' level in Zimbabwe), Marist Brothers (Nyanga High), St Marys, Bonda High, Emmanuel High, Kriste Mambo, Mutare Boys' High School, Mutare Girls High (The Shumbas), St Dominics Mutare, Marange High, Hartzell High, Lydia Chimonyo, [[Sakubva High School|Sakubva High]], Dangamvura High. These have produced exceptional results over the years and a great number of academics renowned internationally.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The privately run [[Africa University]] provides some relief (albeit to a lesser extent), but it simply cannot absorb the huge numbers of school leavers with high grades.

In general, there is a school within a {{convert|5|km|mi}} radius across Manicaland.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} There are numerous primary and secondary schools scattered across the province. The distribution of schools by district is shown in the table below.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
