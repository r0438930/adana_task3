The law firm interviewed more than 150 people and reviewed more than 200,000 pages of documents.\n\nOn August 16, 2018, the firm released its report, which found that seven former faculty members had abused students for years, yet school administrators took no action, even when made aware of the [[sexual misconduct]]. The report said that the abuse, stretching from 1969 through 1992, involved at least 16 students and consisted of intercourse and unnecessary \"medical gynecological\" exams.\n\nA former headmaster who had been serving on the Board of Trustees resigned after cooperating with investigators. Board of Trustee representatives said the information would be turned over to law enforcement officials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hotchkiss-school-sexual-abuse_n_5b79b46ee4b018b93e94eb31|title=Connecticut Boarding School Says 7 Former Staffers Sexually Abused Students|date=Aug 19, 2018|website=HuffPost|accessdate=Aug 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nOperating on a semester schedule, Hotchkiss offers a [[classical education movement|classical education]],<ref name=WhoWeAreTraditions /> 224 courses, 7 foreign languages (Chinese, French, German, Greek, Latin, Russian and Spanish),<ref name=WhoWeAre /> and study abroad programs.<ref name=Intl>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotchkiss.org/abouthotchkiss/international-programs/index.aspx|title=About Hotchkiss: International Programs|publisher=The Hotchkiss School|accessdate=November 19, 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129051945/http://www.hotchkiss.org/abouthotchkiss/international-programs/index.aspx|archivedate=November 29, 2014}}</ref> In 1991, the ''[[New York Times]]'' recognized Hotchkiss' summer program as, \"Summer School for the Very Ambitious\"<ref name=NYT-1991>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/15/nyregion/summer-school-for-the-very-ambitious.html|title=Summer School for the Very Ambitious|first=George|last=Judson|work=New York Times |date=August 15, 1991|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> and in 2011, as a private school leader in the [[farm-to-table]] movement,<ref name=NYT-2011>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/nyregion/prep-schools-encourage-students-to-learn-to-farm.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=At Prep School, Rolling Up Sleeves and Working the Soil|first=Wendy|last=Carlson|work=New York Times|date=November 18, 2011|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> by incorporating agriculture into the curriculum since 2008.<ref name=Farm-NAIS>{{cite web|url=http://inspirationlab.org/story/4023|title=Hotchkiss's Fairfield Farm Grows Up|first=|last=|publisher=National Association of Independent Schools|date=September 10, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref> The year prior, the ''[[Deerfield Academy|Deerfield]] Scroll'' featured that \"many consider The Hotchkiss School to be the leader in environmental awareness among the top prep schools in the country.\"<ref name=DeerfieldScroll-2010>{{cite web|url=http://deerfield.edu/scroll/2010/01/are-they-greener-on-the-other-side-part-three-the-hotchkiss-school/|title=Are They Greener on the Other Side?
