St. Hieronymus elsewhere relates, that this tree had existed from the beginning of the world to the reign of the Emperor Constantine; but he did not say that it had utterly perished, perhaps because at that time, although the whole of that vast tree was not to be seen as it had been formerly, yet a spurious trunk still remained rooted in the ground, protected under the roof of the church, of the height of two men; from this wasted spurious trunk, which has been cut on all sides by axes, small chips are carried to the different provinces of the world, on account of the veneration and memory of that oak, under which, as has been mentioned above, that famous and notable visit of the Angels was granted to the patriarch Abraham.'' <ref name=\"PPTS\">{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti03paleuoft#page/n57/mode/2up/search/hebron |title=The Pilgrimage of Arculfus in the Holy Land (About the Year A.D. 670) |author=Arculf |website=archive.org |publisher=[[Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society]] |location=London |date=1895 |pages=33\u201334 |access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA vignette of the Constantinian basilica with its colonnaded atrium appears on the 6th-century [[Madaba Map]], under the partially preserved Greek caption \"Arbo, also the Terebinth.
