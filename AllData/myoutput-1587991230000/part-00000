Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Mohegan-Pequot language|Mohegan-Pequot]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\".<ref name=\"SOTS\" /> It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States (see [[Connecticut Compromise]]).\n\nThe Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton).

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore]] presides.

Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Mohegan-Pequot language|Mohegan-Pequot]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.
