Matthews]] recalled the \"primitive state of things existing\" in church matters when he reached the Diamond Fields in November 1871: worshippers gathered in a canvas tent billiard-room:\n\n<blockquote>\"On entering I beheld a full-robed clergyman officiating at one end of a billiard-table, which served for his reading desk, whilst a large and attentive crowd sat around the other end, some on rude benches which were fixed along the walls, others perched upon gin cases, buckets reversed, or any other {{sic|nolink=yes|make-shift}} that came to hand. The congregation behaved with suitable decorum, but I confess it was not easy to keep the mind from wandering to the incongruity of the surroundings. ..When the parson was praying or the people singing, it was not particularly edifying to be interrupted by the lively chaff and occasional bursts of blasphemy, which we could plainly hear through the canvas party-walls, which separated us from the adjoining bar and its half tipsy occupants\".<ref name=\"Matthews1887\">{{cite book|author=Josiah Wright Matthews|title=Incwadi Yami|url=https://archive.org/details/incwadiyamiortwe00matt|accessdate=17 September 2013|year=1887|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Searle & Rivington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/incwadiyamiortwe00matt/page/394 394]\u20135}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRickards promoted the cause of [[education]] in Kimberley (three schools originated from this work).
