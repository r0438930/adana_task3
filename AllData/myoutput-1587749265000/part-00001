He is considered a key figure of the Spanish techno of the 1990s, and his works feature electronic instruments and repetitions, as in the refrains of ''Exta s\u00ed, exta no'' or ''As\u00ed me gusta a m\u00ed''. Chimo Bayo defines himself as World Heritage<ref>https://www.eldiario.es/cultura/libros/entrevista-chimo-bayo_0_573593684.html</ref> and specializes in the bakalao music genre (a type of electronic music born in Spain in the mid 80s).<ref>https://www.theransomnote.com/music/interviews/bacalao-the-untold-story-of-valencias-pioneering-80s-90s-rave-scene/</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nHe lived in [[Rubielos de Mora]] in the [[province of Teruel]] before he moved to [[Valencia]], where his mother was from.\n\nIn his youth, he was a motocross competition rider, but a spinal injury ended his career. Later, as a [[DJ]], he spent ten years mixing [[electronic music]] in the 1980s; his musical style goes from dance to [[Industrial music|industrial]]/[[Electronic body music|EBM]], resembling the bands [[Front 242]] or [[Renegade Soundwave]]. He gained popularity as a DJ at the clubs of ''Arsenal'' in [[Oliva]] and ''El Templo'' (later known as Paris-Texas) in [[Cullera]].\n\nThe clothes chosen for his performances were always extravagant: he wore a motocross-style jacket, sunglasses with lights on them, and a cap with his name or the acronym \"[[CCCP]]\" that stands for the [[Soviet Union]] in Russian.\n\nHis daughter, Tanya Bayo, born in 1992, also works in the music industry.<ref>https://cadenaser.com/emisora/2016/05/31/radio_valencia/1464713803_971354.html</ref>\n\n== Musical career== \n\nChimo Bayo started his professional musical career as a DJ in the early 1980s, but it wasn't until 1987 that he released his first mixtape of [[electronic music]]. ''R\u00e1yate'', the cover of which was styled as a [[Smoking (rolling paper)|Smoking]] brand of rolling paper, sold over 20 million copies at that time. Later, his company ''Raya Records'' (Valencia) released ''R\u00e1yate 2'', which also brought oustanding commercial success.\n\nHis first hit was the [[Single (music)|single]] ''As\u00ed me gusta a m\u00ed'' (1991), which sold more than a million copies all over the world, reaching number one in [[Japan]] and [[Israel]]. It was the best selling [[maxi single]] in the history of Spain. An [[Israel|Israeli]] [[singer]], [[Dana International]], [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] this song in her hit ''Saida Sultana'' in 1993.\n\nDue to his rising popularity, he started touring around Europe and Asia, giving more than 100 performances. His most outstanding performance took place in [[Japan]], gathering more than 55.000 people in [[Tokyo Dome]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOtU8hS211Q</ref>\n\nAfter his first grand hit, Chimo Bayo released the [[singles]] ''Qu\u00edmica'' and ''Bombas'', his first No. 1 in [[Japan]] and his most selling record worldwide. Germ\u00e1n Bou is the composer behind Chimo Bayo's hits, being Bayo the author of the lyrics. \n\nHe attended the [[MIDEM]] of [[Cannes]], the prestigious international music festival, as a guest artist representing Spanish [[DJs]] and dance music artists in 1994, named the MIDEM Latino that year.  \n\nHis last successful records were ''La T\u00eda Enriqueta'' and ''La T\u00eda Enriqueta remix'' (1994). \n\nThe downfall of the so-called ''Sonido de Valencia'' and the unpopularity of the best known as ''Ruta Destroy'' in the mid-1990s ended up marking the end of Chimo Bayo's career. His posterior work included hits such as ''B\u00fascala'' and ''Vamos al espacio exterior'', among others. He tried to build an empire of discotheques as an entrepreneur (Planet Valencia, 1999) which ultimately failed. \n\nHe regularly participated in festivals and television shows. Among his latest appearances is his participation in the FEA 2005,  a festival that took place in [[Barcelona]]; in 2006 he recorded a single with the well-known television character [[Dinio]], under the title of ''Mira qu\u00e9 alegr\u00eda (otra vez la polic\u00eda)''.\n\nIn 2007, with his ''Hiper Dance Tour Tazo he performed in all the main cities of [[Spain]],  obtaining  a considerable great public success in his return to the scene of the ''technofiestas''. That same year, he was honoured  by the Mexican singer [[Alaska]] and the Spanish group [[Fangoria]] during the [[FIB]] 2007.\n\n== Chimo Bayo in media ==\n\nAt the end of the 90s, he decided to promote his facet as a showman on television. From 2000 to 2006 he hosted a local late-night show, ''Esto se mueve''. He has been interviewed on [[MTV]], [[Paramount Comedy]], [[Cuatro]] and [[TV3]].\n\nOn March 30, 2007, he made an appearance on [[Antena 3]] where he performed at the late-night show ''Buenafuente'' while on tour in [[Valencia]]. Also that year, he became a protagonist of ''[[La Hora Chanante]]'' in the section \"''Los consejos de Chimo Bayo''\", in which a cartoon character parodied the singer. In fact, this program turned him into an idol in a person of a passionate young man Vicent\u00edn, with whom he danced in the famous Florida Park in [[Madrid]] as a part of ''Fiestaca de la Hora Chanante'' event on [[Comedy Central Spain]].\n\nIn 2008, he appeared on the ''Buenafuente'' TV show on [[LaSexta]] to give an interview and perform for the audience. Later, he composed the popular musical theme ''Zascatronic'', a song that had a great impact on the Internet and was recorded with the invaluable help of [[Berto Romero]].\n\nIn March 2009, ''[[S\u00e9 lo que hicisteis...]]'' show of [[La Sexta]] invited him to star in one of the best TV reports of Pilar Rubio and drive a custom three-seater [[Formula 1]] car in [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo]] in [[Valencia]]. In [[2009]], he also participated in some comedy shows, like in a [[Muchachada Nui|''Muchachada Nui'']] sketch and in an episode of the ''Socarrats'' TV show on [[Canal Nou]].\n\nFrom October 2009 to January 2010, Bayo was one of the jury on the talent scout show ''Un beso y una flor'' presented by [[Bert\u00edn Osborne]] on ''[[Radiotelevisi\u00f3 Valenciana]]''. In the last broadcast, Bayo even mixed a peculiar electronic version of the song of [[Nino Bravo]], the name of which was used as the name of the show. \n\nChimo Bayo has also left his mark in cinematography. His tunes were used to advertise several movies. Just like in his movie [[Jam\u00f3n, jam\u00f3n|''Jam\u00f3n, jam\u00f3n'']] of 1992, [[Bigas Luna]] included the legendary ''As\u00ed me gusta a m\u00ed'' in the trailer and the film [[Yo soy la Juani|''Yo soy la Juani'']].\n\nNowadays he performs on a radio program called ''La casa de la T\u00eda Enriqueta'' (produced by Javier Fern\u00e1ndez) on the local ''Radio Express Valencia. That broadcaster has a website where the program can be followed from across [[Europe]]\n\nIn 2012, in the television show [[Tu cara me suena|''Tu cara me suena,'']] broadcast on the Spanish channel [[Antena 3]], Arturo Valls, a host and an actor, imitated the figure of Chimo Bayo. After that, Chimo regained his popularity. \n\nIn 2016 Chimo Bayo published his first novel, with the journalist Emma Zaf\u00f3n:''No iba a salir y me li\u00e9'', they show their experiences on the Ruta del Bakalao in the form of fiction.\n\n== Eurovision 2010 ==\nIn January 2010 he was a candidate for [[Eurovision]] 2010 with the song ''La Fiesta del Fuego.''
