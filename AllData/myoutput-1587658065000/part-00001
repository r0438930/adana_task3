He is nicknamed \"The Greaseman\". Allegations of racial insensitivity have repeatedly derailed his career as a radio host.\n\n==Personal==\nTracht was born and grew up in the [[South Bronx]] ([[New York City]]) with his younger sister, Diana, and parents, Alfred and Gertrude Tracht. His father was a native New Yorker who sold dental supplies; his mother was a Lutheran immigrant from Germany who stayed home to raise her two children until they were in high school, then became a noted educator.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/2008-05-18/news/obit_2185570v1d0518_1_alzheimer-s-foundation-enfield-family \"TRACHT, Gertrude 'Trudie'\"] Hartford Courant, May 18, 2008.</ref> Tracht attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] and graduated in 1968. He majored in broadcasting at [[Ithaca College]] and landed a job at the college radio station. \"From the first day I got on the air, I was trying to do comedy bits and tell jokes. After my first year in college, I had this station ([[WWWS|WYSL]]) in Buffalo, New York, offer me a big time job.\" Tracht got a job at [[WNYY|WTKO]], a low-power top-40 station in Ithaca. The following year, he had moved up to night DJ at a larger station in Binghamton, New York, WENE.<ref name=PENT /> Tracht graduated from Ithaca College in 1972<ref name=ITHACA>{{cite news |work=[[The Ithacan]] |via=digitalcommons.ithaca.edu |date=March 4, 1999 |first=Kevin |last=Rettig |title=Alumnus 'Greaseman' wiped off D.C. airwaves |url=https://digitalcommons.ithaca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=ithacan_1998-99}}</ref>\nand married Marie Massara who was the sales secretary at WENE.<ref>[http://www.greaseman.org/ \"A Greaseman Biography\"] Greaseman website.</ref>\n\n==The name==\nThe Greaseman pseudonym originated while he was in college. \"In those days of top 40, everybody who was on the radio was 'cookin'; cookin' with the Temptations, cookin' Four Tops, that kind of thing. Which meant they were really rockin'. One day I said I was cookin' with heavy grease. It was my way of saying I was out-cookin' the other guys. I said it enough times, so one day one of the other deejays referred to me as the Greaseman.\"<ref name=PENT />\nHis radio name had been ''Dougie T'', but when he became ''the Greaseman'', a different personality surfaced. His voice deepened and he projected the image of a middle-aged tattooed truck driver with a beer belly and a cigar.<ref name=COMEBACK /> In reality, Tracht was 6 foot 2 and 150 pounds. He used the radio as an alter ego; a guy with a swaggering bravado.<ref name=PENT /> At WENE, he was asked to do remote broadcasts from a sponsor's business and listeners were disappointed to see that he looked like a wimp.<ref name=SCHIZO />  In later years, Tracht took up bodybuilding to improve his physique.<ref name=PENT />\n\n==The show==\n\"The Greaseman Show\" is a fast-paced array of what he terms \"bits.\" Calls from listeners inevitably lead to a story of a recurring character from his repertoire, and no topic is taboo. He calls his deep voice his \"basso grosso\" or \"basso profundo.\"<ref name=PENT />\nAs The Greaseman, Tracht invented a clever way of getting around limits on indecent language by using slang terms for body parts and functions that he invented. His listeners knew the meanings of the terms. In this way, he managed to directly discuss very explicitly adult topics without alerting censors, or alarming parents who did not understand the private language.\n\n== Career ==\n\n===Early career===\nTracht went through a string of stations including [[WHIC|WAXC]] in [[Rochester, New York]], [[WTEM|WRC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[WPOP]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. He lost his job at WPOP when that station switched its format from pop music to all news in 1975. He lost the job at WRC because program director Gordon Peil wanted Tracht to drop the Greaseman personality. The frequent moves from city to city were a major reason for the end of his first marriage, after less than two years.<ref name=SCHIZO /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.98wrc.com/greaseman.htm|title=\"Skip McCloskey Remembers:Greaseman\"}}</ref>\n\n===Success===\nTracht found a home at [[WOKV (AM)|WAPE]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in August 1975 and became the dominant radio personality not just in northeast Florida,<ref name=OFF>Patton, Charlie: [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/012298/S0122Gon.html \"Greaseman's off local radio dial once again\"] Florida Times-Union, January 22, 1998.</ref> but in the Southeastern United States<ref name=PENT /> While in Jacksonville, his true identity was kept confidential because the public was disappointed that the booming, macho voice belonged to a young guy who was skinny and shy. The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung in the window of the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.<ref name=SCHIZO />\n\nHe was an early [[shock jock]], but Tracht denies the label: \"I'm telling jokes. The bottom line\u2014it's a comedy show.\"<ref name=PENT /> \"I'm creating characters and stories, I'm weaving a tapestry of humor. The others are just saying nasty things.\"<ref name=SCHIZO />\nHowever, his show was outrageous and edgy, which offended some people. Tracht kept his stories from violating FCC obscenity regulations by using \"code words\" for certain anatomical features (''hydraulics'' for male genitalia, ''fudge packing'' for anal sex, for instance) and sound effects for physical acts.\n\nAllen Moore, WAPE's news director, was also a [[bodybuilder]]. Tracht questioned Moore about his hobby, and Moore encouraged Tracht to try it. Tracht began a high protein diet of canned tuna, raw eggs, and milk; took vitamins; and lifted weights for 90 minutes a day. In the first three months, he added 25 pounds of muscle to his thin physique.<ref name=PENT /> After a year, he had gained 45 pounds, and people commented that he looked like [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref name=SCHIZO /> Tracht enrolled in an evening law enforcement training program, and after completing it, he volunteered as an auxiliary officer. He occasionally worked the night shift with the Clay County Sheriff's Office, then went directly to the station at 5:30&nbsp;a.m. for his morning show, still in uniform.<ref name=SCHIZO /> One of his most popular bits was stories portraying what it would be like to be a lawman. He would state \"What it must be like to strap on a gun, pin on a badge and become a lawman\" under the theme song to the TV program SWAT.\n\nOn May 25, 1979, Tracht gained national attention when he mocked convicted murderer [[John Spenkelink]], who was due to be executed in \"[[Old Sparky]],\" the [[Florida State Prison]] electric chair, that day. Tracht aired a recording of sizzling bacon and dedicated it to Spenkelink, telling him to get used to the sound.<ref>Michaud S, Aynesworth H (1999): ''The Only Living Witness''.

DC-101 was his first [[FM broadcast band|FM]] station. He purchased a home in nearby [[Potomac, Maryland]], continued working out, and overcame his dislike of public appearances. During that time, he was known for a series of publicity stunts, including his \"presidential campaign\" in 1984.\n\n===WMATA (DC subway rail service) audio-skit===\n\nOne of his audio-skits was a story of himself as an explorer being chased.  The story was complete with bongos playing in the background with intermittent screeches of wild jungle birds.  The implication was he was being chased by cannibals in the jungle.  The bongo drums became louder and louder as the story progressed, implying those chasing him were getting closer and closer and he was getting more and more desperate to escape.  The story ended just as he was about to be caught when he \"...jumped on the Red Line and went home!\"\n\n===Martin Luther King Day comment===\nIn January 1986, Tracht created an uproar by telling an on-air joke regarding the new federal holiday, [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day|Martin Luther King Day]].  Tracht said, \"Why don't we shoot four more and get the whole week off?\" followed by, \"Come on, now, you know I don't mean nothin'!\" He was suspended from the station for five days, publicly apologized, and donated money to create a scholarship at [[Howard University]] in honor of [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. King]].<ref name=SLIDE /> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted that he was the highest paid DJ in D.C. during 1987, making $400,000 a year.<ref name=SCHIZO>Smith, Gary: [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73859635.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+29%2C+1987&author=Gary+Smith&desc=I%27m+Almost+A+Trained+Schizo%27 \"I'm Almost A Trained Schizo'\"] Washington Post, November 29, 1987.</ref>\n\n===Syndication===\nHis show was [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] by [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]] for five years, from January 1993 until January 1998. Tracht moved to [[Los Angeles]], where his show originated from a private broadcasting studio in LA, and was carried by stations in Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and [[KLOS]] in Los Angeles, among others. During 1994 his audience was estimated at 2.5 million listeners each day.<ref name=PENT>Reifer, Susan: [http://www.greaseman.org/ph_199412.html \"GREASEMAN\"] Penthouse Magazine, December 1994.</ref>\n\nSyndication was not as successful as Infinity had hoped, so the contract was not extended beyond five years. In the last year of his Infinity contract, he was hired by [[WIAD|WARW-FM]] for $1 million per year and returned to Washington, D.C., where he again incorporated music into his show.<ref name=IMUS />\n\n===James Byrd comment===\nOn February 24, 1999, after a year at WARW (now [[WIAD]]), Tracht made a comment about [[James Byrd Jr.|James Byrd]], who was murdered in 1998 by being dragged behind a pickup truck by three men, two determined to be [[white supremacists]]. The day before, jurors had convicted John William King of Byrd's murder.<ref>Lyman, Rick: [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/us/texas-jury-picks-death-sentence-in-fatal-dragging-of-a-black-man.html?ref=john_william_king \"Texas Jury Picks Death Sentence In Fatal Dragging of a Black Man\"] New York Times, February 26, 1999.</ref> Tracht had been playing a sound bite of [[Lauryn Hill]] who had ten nominations at the [[41st Grammy Awards]]. Tracht then stated, \"No wonder people drag them behind trucks.\"<ref name=RACIST /> After the comment, he immediately stated that he \"didn't mean nothin'.\" This incident proved catastrophic to his radio career, igniting a firestorm of protest from listeners of all races, including [[Donnie Simpson]], who lambasted Tracht on his morning show on sister station [[WPGC-FM]]. Not only was Tracht quickly [[Firing|fired]] from WARW, but he also lost his position as a volunteer [[deputy sheriff]] in [[Falls Church, Virginia]].<ref name=RACIST>{{cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-571390.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106104206/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-571390.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=November 6, 2012|title='Greaseman' Suspended for Racist Remark; WARW Pulls Doug Tracht Off the Air, Offers Apology |newspaper=The Washington Post|date= February 25, 1999}}</ref>\n\n====Apology====\nRock Newman was a black businessman who knew Tracht before the incident. Newman felt that Tracht was truly sorry and accompanied Doug and his wife on a quest to apologize and show that he wasn't a racist.<ref name=IMUS /> The week following his firing, Tracht held a press conference and made an apology to his listeners, \"Every day you deserve my best, and last Wednesday I gave you my worst. This experience, compiled with my past transgressions upon racial and human decency, have forever taught me the value of respect and restraint.\"<ref name=ITHACA /> They spoke to several black organizations, then appeared on ''BET Tonight'' with [[Tavis Smiley]] on [[Black Entertainment Television]] where he faced angry questions. After being confronted by one caller, Tracht begged, \"Let me down off this cross, will you?\"<ref name=SLIDE /> Counseling was recommended. The show asked its audience what Tracht could do, but almost 75 percent said \"nothing.\"<ref name=IMUS />\n\n====Penance====\nA worker at [[DC Central Kitchen]] saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard his desire to show he was sorry. She thought that the \"Kitchen\" would be a good place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and cleaning bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: \"It's the kind of place where you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice.\"<ref name=IMUS />\n\nTracht began counseling with a psychologist at [[Howard University]]. After the counselor got to know his patient, he stated, \"I saw nothing consistent with what I would expect to find with someone who is a racist.\"<ref name=IMUS /> Tracht continued to see the therapist weekly for over a year.<ref name=SLIDE />\n\nIn February 2000, a station owner in [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands]], offered Tracht a DJ job. Tracht intended to make a new start, but when local residents found out about it, they objected. Local politicians talked to the station owner, who was \"persuaded\" to rescind the offer.<ref name=IMUS />\n\nTracht had a part in the [[Discovery Channel]]'s show ''The FBI Files'' and appeared in an [[infomercial]] for an internet dating site in 2000.<ref name=IMUS />\n\n===Later career===\nBy 2002 Tracht returned to the air from his home studio, broadcasting on [[WDMV]] AM 700 (previously WGOP) near [[Frederick, Maryland]], and was soon afterward [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to numerous other stations in the region. He then held the morning-show slot on [[WMET]] AM 1160 in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], until November 2, 2007. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has described this period as \"six years of broadcasting his morning show on tiny, unknown AM stations with signals so weak they dissolve under the static created by a car's ignition system.\"<ref name=SLIDE>Fisher, Marc: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112300491.html \"Imus Returning, but Greaseman Can't Stop His Long Slide\"] The Washington Post, November 25, 2007, page M05.</ref><ref name=IMUS>Ahrens, Frank: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-03/09/041r-030900-idx.html \"The Silenced Greaseman\"] The Washington Post, March 9, 2000, page C01.</ref>\n\n[[Marc Fisher]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist, wrote a story in November 2007 that questioned why Tracht hadn't been rehabilitated to the public like other broadcasters: [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]], [[Don Imus]], [[Marv Albert]], and [[Opie and Anthony]]. All were suspended for bad behavior, some of which was criminal, but all returned to the microphone. Fisher called Tracht \"the most talented of the shock jocks, a storyteller so verbally nimble, so fantastically imaginative that his showmanship seemed wasted on an audience of adolescent guys.\"<ref name=COMEBACK>Patton, Charlie: [http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/100108/met_338771561.shtml \"Greaseman begins his comeback in city today\"] Florida Times-Union, October 1, 2008.</ref><ref name=SLIDE />\n\nSelected Greaseman bits were heard during late [[Drive time|PM drive]] on WGRX-FM 104.5 in the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], area. On March 31, 2008, [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] announced that the Greaseman show would be returning on Saturday mornings beginning April 5, 2008, and that the run would go until October 2008, after [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] decided to have more \"music intensive\" weekends on DC101.\n\n====Jacksonville again====\nIn January 2008 David Israel, the vice president and general manager of [[Cox Radio]] in Jacksonville, brought back [[Bubba the Love Sponge]], who was fired in 2004 for indecency. When people asked about Tracht, another former Jacksonville radio personality, Israel tracked him down and they began discussing a job in August 2008.<ref name=COMEBACK /> On September 29, 2008, during the Bubba the Love Sponge show, it was announced that Tracht would be returning to [[Jacksonville]] to do the afternoon show.<ref name=COMEBACK /><ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Boyle |title='Greaseman' Returning To DC101 |url=http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebSite/NewsStoryPage.aspx?ContentID=jFLtl7QcI2g%3d&Version=0 |work=Radio and Records |accessdate=2008-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926203809/http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebSite/NewsStoryPage.aspx?ContentID=jFLtl7QcI2g%3D&Version=0 |archive-date=2008-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This wasn't his first time back since his 1982 departure from WAPE. In the fall of 1996, his show was broadcast via syndication in Jacksonville over [[WXXJ (FM)|WTLK-FM]] \"Real Radio\" 106.5, where it lasted until January 1998, when the station changed owners and formats. On October 1, 2008, the Greaseman began his 3\u20137 p.m. show on [[WOKV-FM|WFYV-FM]]. He planned to originate some of the shows from his Maryland home studio, with the Jacksonville station studio hosting most of the time. According to Tracht, \"It's a thrill, frankly, to be back in Jacksonville. This is where the Greaseman bloomed.\"<ref name=COMEBACK />\n\nOn August 10, 2010, the Greaseman didn't host his afternoon show. \"Jake\" from Kansas City was on the air, and there was no explanation on the WFYV website; all references to Tracht were removed, as well as another DJ, Cowhead.<ref>[http://rock105i.com/inside/personalities.html \"Personalities\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815212021/http://rock105i.com/inside/personalities.html |date=August 15, 2010}} Rock 105 WFYV.</ref>\nThis notice was posted on the greaseman.org website:\n<blockquote>\n\"The Grease Show is no longer airing on Rock105 in Jacksonville.

The frequent moves from city to city were a major reason for the end of his first marriage, after less than two years.<ref name=SCHIZO /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.98wrc.com/greaseman.htm|title=\"Skip McCloskey Remembers:Greaseman\"}}</ref>\n\n===Success===\nTracht found a home at [[WOKV (AM)|WAPE]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in August 1975 and became the dominant radio personality not just in northeast Florida,<ref name=OFF>Patton, Charlie: [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/012298/S0122Gon.html \"Greaseman's off local radio dial once again\"] Florida Times-Union, January 22, 1998.</ref> but in the Southeastern United States<ref name=PENT /> While in Jacksonville, his true identity was kept confidential because the public was disappointed that the booming, macho voice belonged to a young guy who was skinny and shy. The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung in the window of the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.<ref name=SCHIZO />\n\nHe was an early [[shock jock]], but Tracht denies the label: \"I'm telling jokes. The bottom line\u2014it's a comedy show.\"<ref name=PENT /> \"I'm creating characters and stories, I'm weaving a tapestry of humor. The others are just saying nasty things.\"<ref name=SCHIZO />\nHowever, his show was outrageous and edgy, which offended some people. Tracht kept his stories from violating FCC obscenity regulations by using \"code words\" for certain anatomical features (''hydraulics'' for male genitalia, ''fudge packing'' for anal sex, for instance) and sound effects for physical acts.\n\nAllen Moore, WAPE's news director, was also a [[bodybuilder]]. Tracht questioned Moore about his hobby, and Moore encouraged Tracht to try it. Tracht began a high protein diet of canned tuna, raw eggs, and milk; took vitamins; and lifted weights for 90 minutes a day. In the first three months, he added 25 pounds of muscle to his thin physique.<ref name=PENT /> After a year, he had gained 45 pounds, and people commented that he looked like [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref name=SCHIZO /> Tracht enrolled in an evening law enforcement training program, and after completing it, he volunteered as an auxiliary officer. He occasionally worked the night shift with the Clay County Sheriff's Office, then went directly to the station at 5:30&nbsp;a.m. for his morning show, still in uniform.<ref name=SCHIZO /> One of his most popular bits was stories portraying what it would be like to be a lawman. He would state \"What it must be like to strap on a gun, pin on a badge and become a lawman\" under the theme song to the TV program SWAT.\n\nOn May 25, 1979, Tracht gained national attention when he mocked convicted murderer [[John Spenkelink]], who was due to be executed in \"[[Old Sparky]],\" the [[Florida State Prison]] electric chair, that day. Tracht aired a recording of sizzling bacon and dedicated it to Spenkelink, telling him to get used to the sound.<ref>Michaud S, Aynesworth H (1999): ''The Only Living Witness''.

DC-101 was his first [[FM broadcast band|FM]] station. He purchased a home in nearby [[Potomac, Maryland]], continued working out, and overcame his dislike of public appearances. During that time, he was known for a series of publicity stunts, including his \"presidential campaign\" in 1984.\n\n===WMATA (DC subway rail service) audio-skit===\n\nOne of his audio-skits was a story of himself as an explorer being chased.  The story was complete with bongos playing in the background with intermittent screeches of wild jungle birds.  The implication was he was being chased by cannibals in the jungle.  The bongo drums became louder and louder as the story progressed, implying those chasing him were getting closer and closer and he was getting more and more desperate to escape.  The story ended just as he was about to be caught when he \"...jumped on the Red Line and went home!\"\n\n===Martin Luther King Day comment===\nIn January 1986, Tracht created an uproar by telling an on-air joke regarding the new federal holiday, [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day|Martin Luther King Day]].  Tracht said, \"Why don't we shoot four more and get the whole week off?\" followed by, \"Come on, now, you know I don't mean nothin'!\" He was suspended from the station for five days, publicly apologized, and donated money to create a scholarship at [[Howard University]] in honor of [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. King]].<ref name=SLIDE /> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted that he was the highest paid DJ in D.C. during 1987, making $400,000 a year.<ref name=SCHIZO>Smith, Gary: [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73859635.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+29%2C+1987&author=Gary+Smith&desc=I%27m+Almost+A+Trained+Schizo%27 \"I'm Almost A Trained Schizo'\"] Washington Post, November 29, 1987.</ref>\n\n===Syndication===\nHis show was [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] by [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]] for five years, from January 1993 until January 1998. Tracht moved to [[Los Angeles]], where his show originated from a private broadcasting studio in LA, and was carried by stations in Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and [[KLOS]] in Los Angeles, among others. During 1994 his audience was estimated at 2.5 million listeners each day.<ref name=PENT>Reifer, Susan: [http://www.greaseman.org/ph_199412.html \"GREASEMAN\"] Penthouse Magazine, December 1994.</ref>\n\nSyndication was not as successful as Infinity had hoped, so the contract was not extended beyond five years. In the last year of his Infinity contract, he was hired by [[WIAD|WARW-FM]] for $1 million per year and returned to Washington, D.C., where he again incorporated music into his show.<ref name=IMUS />\n\n===James Byrd comment===\nOn February 24, 1999, after a year at WARW (now [[WIAD]]), Tracht made a comment about [[James Byrd Jr.|James Byrd]], who was murdered in 1998 by being dragged behind a pickup truck by three men, two determined to be [[white supremacists]]. The day before, jurors had convicted John William King of Byrd's murder.<ref>Lyman, Rick: [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/us/texas-jury-picks-death-sentence-in-fatal-dragging-of-a-black-man.html?ref=john_william_king \"Texas Jury Picks Death Sentence In Fatal Dragging of a Black Man\"] New York Times, February 26, 1999.</ref> Tracht had been playing a sound bite of [[Lauryn Hill]] who had ten nominations at the [[41st Grammy Awards]]. Tracht then stated, \"No wonder people drag them behind trucks.\"<ref name=RACIST /> After the comment, he immediately stated that he \"didn't mean nothin'.\" This incident proved catastrophic to his radio career, igniting a firestorm of protest from listeners of all races, including [[Donnie Simpson]], who lambasted Tracht on his morning show on sister station [[WPGC-FM]]. Not only was Tracht quickly [[Firing|fired]] from WARW, but he also lost his position as a volunteer [[deputy sheriff]] in [[Falls Church, Virginia]].<ref name=RACIST>{{cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-571390.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106104206/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-571390.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=November 6, 2012|title='Greaseman' Suspended for Racist Remark; WARW Pulls Doug Tracht Off the Air, Offers Apology |newspaper=The Washington Post|date= February 25, 1999}}</ref>\n\n====Apology====\nRock Newman was a black businessman who knew Tracht before the incident. Newman felt that Tracht was truly sorry and accompanied Doug and his wife on a quest to apologize and show that he wasn't a racist.<ref name=IMUS /> The week following his firing, Tracht held a press conference and made an apology to his listeners, \"Every day you deserve my best, and last Wednesday I gave you my worst. This experience, compiled with my past transgressions upon racial and human decency, have forever taught me the value of respect and restraint.\"<ref name=ITHACA /> They spoke to several black organizations, then appeared on ''BET Tonight'' with [[Tavis Smiley]] on [[Black Entertainment Television]] where he faced angry questions. After being confronted by one caller, Tracht begged, \"Let me down off this cross, will you?\"<ref name=SLIDE /> Counseling was recommended. The show asked its audience what Tracht could do, but almost 75 percent said \"nothing.\"<ref name=IMUS />\n\n====Penance====\nA worker at [[DC Central Kitchen]] saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard his desire to show he was sorry. She thought that the \"Kitchen\" would be a good place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and cleaning bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: \"It's the kind of place where you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice.\"<ref name=IMUS />\n\nTracht began counseling with a psychologist at [[Howard University]]. After the counselor got to know his patient, he stated, \"I saw nothing consistent with what I would expect to find with someone who is a racist.\"<ref name=IMUS /> Tracht continued to see the therapist weekly for over a year.<ref name=SLIDE />\n\nIn February 2000, a station owner in [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands]], offered Tracht a DJ job. Tracht intended to make a new start, but when local residents found out about it, they objected. Local politicians talked to the station owner, who was \"persuaded\" to rescind the offer.<ref name=IMUS />\n\nTracht had a part in the [[Discovery Channel]]'s show ''The FBI Files'' and appeared in an [[infomercial]] for an internet dating site in 2000.<ref name=IMUS />\n\n===Later career===\nBy 2002 Tracht returned to the air from his home studio, broadcasting on [[WDMV]] AM 700 (previously WGOP) near [[Frederick, Maryland]], and was soon afterward [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to numerous other stations in the region. He then held the morning-show slot on [[WMET]] AM 1160 in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], until November 2, 2007. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has described this period as \"six years of broadcasting his morning show on tiny, unknown AM stations with signals so weak they dissolve under the static created by a car's ignition system.\"<ref name=SLIDE>Fisher, Marc: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112300491.html \"Imus Returning, but Greaseman Can't Stop His Long Slide\"] The Washington Post, November 25, 2007, page M05.</ref><ref name=IMUS>Ahrens, Frank: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-03/09/041r-030900-idx.html \"The Silenced Greaseman\"] The Washington Post, March 9, 2000, page C01.</ref>\n\n[[Marc Fisher]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist, wrote a story in November 2007 that questioned why Tracht hadn't been rehabilitated to the public like other broadcasters: [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]], [[Don Imus]], [[Marv Albert]], and [[Opie and Anthony]]. All were suspended for bad behavior, some of which was criminal, but all returned to the microphone. Fisher called Tracht \"the most talented of the shock jocks, a storyteller so verbally nimble, so fantastically imaginative that his showmanship seemed wasted on an audience of adolescent guys.\"<ref name=COMEBACK>Patton, Charlie: [http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/100108/met_338771561.shtml \"Greaseman begins his comeback in city today\"] Florida Times-Union, October 1, 2008.</ref><ref name=SLIDE />\n\nSelected Greaseman bits were heard during late [[Drive time|PM drive]] on WGRX-FM 104.5 in the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], area. On March 31, 2008, [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] announced that the Greaseman show would be returning on Saturday mornings beginning April 5, 2008, and that the run would go until October 2008, after [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] decided to have more \"music intensive\" weekends on DC101.\n\n====Jacksonville again====\nIn January 2008 David Israel, the vice president and general manager of [[Cox Radio]] in Jacksonville, brought back [[Bubba the Love Sponge]], who was fired in 2004 for indecency. When people asked about Tracht, another former Jacksonville radio personality, Israel tracked him down and they began discussing a job in August 2008.<ref name=COMEBACK /> On September 29, 2008, during the Bubba the Love Sponge show, it was announced that Tracht would be returning to [[Jacksonville]] to do the afternoon show.<ref name=COMEBACK /><ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Boyle |title='Greaseman' Returning To DC101 |url=http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebSite/NewsStoryPage.aspx?ContentID=jFLtl7QcI2g%3d&Version=0 |work=Radio and Records |accessdate=2008-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926203809/http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebSite/NewsStoryPage.aspx?ContentID=jFLtl7QcI2g%3D&Version=0 |archive-date=2008-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This wasn't his first time back since his 1982 departure from WAPE. In the fall of 1996, his show was broadcast via syndication in Jacksonville over [[WXXJ (FM)|WTLK-FM]] \"Real Radio\" 106.5, where it lasted until January 1998, when the station changed owners and formats. On October 1, 2008, the Greaseman began his 3\u20137 p.m. show on [[WOKV-FM|WFYV-FM]]. He planned to originate some of the shows from his Maryland home studio, with the Jacksonville station studio hosting most of the time. According to Tracht, \"It's a thrill, frankly, to be back in Jacksonville. This is where the Greaseman bloomed.\"<ref name=COMEBACK />\n\nOn August 10, 2010, the Greaseman didn't host his afternoon show. \"Jake\" from Kansas City was on the air, and there was no explanation on the WFYV website; all references to Tracht were removed, as well as another DJ, Cowhead.<ref>[http://rock105i.com/inside/personalities.html \"Personalities\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815212021/http://rock105i.com/inside/personalities.html |date=August 15, 2010}} Rock 105 WFYV.</ref>\nThis notice was posted on the greaseman.org website:\n<blockquote>\n\"The Grease Show is no longer airing on Rock105 in Jacksonville.
