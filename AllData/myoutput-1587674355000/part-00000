Founded in 1956, BCS has played an important role in educating and nurturing IT professionals, computer scientists, computer engineers, upholding the profession, accrediting chartered IT professional status, and creating a global community active in promoting and furthering the field and practice of computing.\n\n== Overview ==\nWith a worldwide membership of over 68,000 members in over 150 countries, BCS is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]] and was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1984. Its objectives are to promote the study and application of communications technology and computing technology and to advance knowledge of education in ICT for the benefit of professional practitioners and the general public.\n\nBCS is a member institution of [[Engineering Council]], through which it is licensed to award the designation of [[Incorporated Engineer]] and [[Chartered Engineer]] and therefore is responsible for the regulation of ICT and computer science fields within the UK. The BCS is also a member of the [[CEPIS|Council of European Professional Informatics Societies]] (CEPIS) and the [[Seoul Accord]] for international tertiary degree recognition. BCS was previously a member organisation of the [[Science Council]] through which it was licensed to award the designation of [[Chartered Scientist]].\n\nBCS has offices off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[Southampton Street, London|Southampton Street]], south of [[Covent Garden]] in central [[London]]. The main administrative offices are in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]], west of London. It also has two overseas offices in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Mauritius]].\n\nMembers are sent the quarterly IT professional magazine ''[[ITNOW]]'' (formerly ''The Computer Bulletin'').\n\nBCS is a member organization of the [[Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations]] (FEAPO), a worldwide association of professional organizations which have come together to provide a forum to standardize, professionalize, and otherwise advance the discipline of [[Enterprise Architecture]].\n\n==History==\nThe forerunner of BCS was the \"London Computer Group\" (LCG), founded in 1956. BCS was formed a year later from the merger of the LCG and an unincorporated association of scientists into an unincorporated club. In October 1957, BCS was incorporated, by [[Articles of Association (law)|Articles of Association]], as \"The British Computer Society Ltd\": the first President of BCS was Sir [[Maurice Wilkes]] (1913\u20132010), [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]].\n\nIn 1966, the BCS was granted charitable status and in 1970, the BCS was given [[Coat of arms|Armorial Bearings]] including the shield and crest.\nThe major ethical responsibilities of BCS are emphasized by the leopard's face, surmounting the whole crest and depicting eternal vigilance over the integrity of the Society and its members.\n\nThe BCS patron is [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|The Duke of Kent]], [[Order of the Garter|KG]]. He became patron in December 1976 and has been actively involved in BCS activities, particularly having been President in the [[Silver Jubilee]] Year in 1982\u20131983.\n\nIn 2007, BCS launched ''BCSrecruit.com'' \u2013 a job site specifically aimed at IT professionals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/british-computer-society-launches-bcsrecruitcom-jobs-board |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221102542/http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/british-computer-society-launches-bcsrecruitcom-jobs-board |archivedate=21 December 2013 |title=British Computer Society launches BCSrecruit.com jobs board |website=PublicTechnology.net |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> In 2008 the BCS was labelled \"irrelevant\" by an IT training company, in connection with claims it made that nine out of ten IT professionals were \"unaware\" of the BCS's Chartered accreditation scheme.<ref name=\"v3 williams 2008\">{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Ian|title=BCS slammed as 'outdated' and 'irrelevant'|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1941031/bcs-slammed-outdated-irrelevant|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=[[v3.co.uk]]|date=28 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 September 2009, the British Computer Society went through a transformation and re-branded itself as \"BCS \u2013 The Chartered Institute for IT\".<ref name=\"rebrand\">\n{{cite journal |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/1828171/bcs-the-chartered-institute-it |title= BCS becomes The Chartered Institute for IT |first=Dave |last=Bailey |date=21 September 2009 |publisher=British Computer Society |journal=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref> In 2010, an [[Extraordinary General Meeting]] was called to discuss the direction of the BCS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yourfuture.bcs.org/ |title=BCS \u2013 Building for your Future |publisher=British Computer Society |year=2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528093404/http://yourfuture.bcs.org/ |archivedate=28 May 2010 }}</ref> The debate has been covered by the computing press.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bill |last=Goodwin |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/read-all-about-it/2010/04/the-egm-debate-bcs-v-len-keigh.html |title=The EGM debate: BCS v Len Keighley |publisher=[[Computer Weekly]] |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Maxwell |last=Cooter |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060410-bcs-membership-fights-over.html |title=BCS membership fights over direction |journal=[[Network World]] |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607071255/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060410-bcs-membership-fights-over.html |archivedate=7 June 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Simon |last=Phipps |url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/community/blogs/index.cfm?blogid=41&entryid=3026 |title=BCS EGM: It's Time To Vote For Transparency |journal=[[Computerworld]] UK |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Oates |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/21/bcs_rebel/ |title=BCS trustee threatens rebels with libel action |work=[[The Register]] |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nBCS is governed by a [[Trustee]] Board comprising the President, the Deputy President, the immediate past President, up to nine Vice Presidents (including Vice-President Finance), and five Professional Members elected by the Advisory Council.<ref name=\"Boards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bcs.org/category/13817 |title=Boards and Committees |website=British Computer Society |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> Sir [[Maurice Wilkes]], Professor of Computer Science at Cambridge University, served as its first president.

However, the BCS no longer offers [[Chartered Scientist]] status (''CSci'')\n* Members may also apply through BCS to the [[European Federation of National Engineering Associations]] (FEANI) for [[European Engineer]] (''Eur Ing'') status.\n\n;Designatory (post-nominal) letters\nMembers are encouraged to display the designatory letters to which they are entitled whenever appropriate. The order of designatory (post-nominal) letters is complex and open to a certain amount of interpretation. The accepted authority on this subject is ''Debrett\u2019s Correct Form''. Normally these should appear after decorations, degrees and chartered letters. Members holding CEng should also display the designatory letters of the institution through which they are registered immediately after the CEng. Conventionally, members holding Chartered status ([[Chartered IT Professional|CITP]]) display this immediately after their membership letters (e.g., FBCS CITP or MBCS CITP). However, as CITP may now be awarded by other organisations it may also be displayed separately, following that of the awarding institution.\n\nSome examples of BCS-related post-nominals:\n\n* Mr Frank James [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]], FBCS.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, [[Master of Science|MSc]], [[CEng]], MBCS, MIET.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] ([[Honours degree|Hons]]), MBCS, CITP.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, MSc, [[Chartered Scientist|CSci]], MIET, CITP.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, [[Master of Science|MSc]], MCGI, [[CEng]], MBCS, FEDIPAdvPra.\n\n==Awards==\nThe society provides several awards to recognize outstanding computer scientists, engineers, experienced and young IT professionals.\nThe awards include:\n\n* [[Lovelace Medal]]\n* [[Roger Needham Award]]\n* Early Career Award\n* John Perry Prize\n* Distinguished Dissertation Award\n* UK Industry Award\n\n==Qualifications==\nBCS provides a range of qualifications both for users of computers and [[Information technology|IT]] professionals.\n\n===BCS IT User Qualifications===\nBCS offers qualifications that cover all areas of IT, including understanding Spreadsheets and Presentation Software, Animation, Video Editing and Social Networking safety.<ref>IT User Qualifications: http://www.bcs.org/category/14405</ref>\n\nThe current IT user qualifications are:\n\n[[File:ECDL ft rgb2.jpg|200px|right]]\n*[[European Computer Driving Licence]] (ECDL) - BCS is the only organisation licensed to offer ECDL qualifications in the UK.\n*[[European Computer Driving Licence#ECDL Advanced|Advanced ECDL]] - the advanced course of ECDL (\"Advanced ECDL\") has four sections, each a qualification in its own right.

Founded in 1956, BCS has played an important role in educating and nurturing IT professionals, computer scientists, computer engineers, upholding the profession, accrediting chartered IT professional status, and creating a global community active in promoting and furthering the field and practice of computing.\n\n== Overview ==\nWith a worldwide membership of over 68,000 members in over 150 countries, BCS is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]] and was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1984. Its objectives are to promote the study and application of communications technology and computing technology and to advance knowledge of education in ICT for the benefit of professional practitioners and the general public.\n\nBCS is a member institution of [[Engineering Council]], through which it is licensed to award the designation of [[Incorporated Engineer]] and [[Chartered Engineer]] and therefore is responsible for the regulation of ICT and computer science fields within the UK. The BCS is also a member of the [[CEPIS|Council of European Professional Informatics Societies]] (CEPIS) and the [[Seoul Accord]] for international tertiary degree recognition. BCS was previously a member organisation of the [[Science Council]] through which it was licensed to award the designation of [[Chartered Scientist]].\n\nBCS has offices off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[Southampton Street, London|Southampton Street]], south of [[Covent Garden]] in central [[London]]. The main administrative offices are in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]], west of London. It also has two overseas offices in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Mauritius]].\n\nMembers are sent the quarterly IT professional magazine ''[[ITNOW]]'' (formerly ''The Computer Bulletin'').\n\nBCS is a member organization of the [[Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations]] (FEAPO), a worldwide association of professional organizations which have come together to provide a forum to standardize, professionalize, and otherwise advance the discipline of [[Enterprise Architecture]].\n\n==History==\nThe forerunner of BCS was the \"London Computer Group\" (LCG), founded in 1956. BCS was formed a year later from the merger of the LCG and an unincorporated association of scientists into an unincorporated club. In October 1957, BCS was incorporated, by [[Articles of Association (law)|Articles of Association]], as \"The British Computer Society Ltd\": the first President of BCS was Sir [[Maurice Wilkes]] (1913\u20132010), [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]].\n\nIn 1966, the BCS was granted charitable status and in 1970, the BCS was given [[Coat of arms|Armorial Bearings]] including the shield and crest.\nThe major ethical responsibilities of BCS are emphasized by the leopard's face, surmounting the whole crest and depicting eternal vigilance over the integrity of the Society and its members.\n\nThe BCS patron is [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|The Duke of Kent]], [[Order of the Garter|KG]]. He became patron in December 1976 and has been actively involved in BCS activities, particularly having been President in the [[Silver Jubilee]] Year in 1982\u20131983.\n\nIn 2007, BCS launched ''BCSrecruit.com'' \u2013 a job site specifically aimed at IT professionals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/british-computer-society-launches-bcsrecruitcom-jobs-board |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221102542/http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/british-computer-society-launches-bcsrecruitcom-jobs-board |archivedate=21 December 2013 |title=British Computer Society launches BCSrecruit.com jobs board |website=PublicTechnology.net |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> In 2008 the BCS was labelled \"irrelevant\" by an IT training company, in connection with claims it made that nine out of ten IT professionals were \"unaware\" of the BCS's Chartered accreditation scheme.<ref name=\"v3 williams 2008\">{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Ian|title=BCS slammed as 'outdated' and 'irrelevant'|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1941031/bcs-slammed-outdated-irrelevant|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=[[v3.co.uk]]|date=28 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 September 2009, the British Computer Society went through a transformation and re-branded itself as \"BCS \u2013 The Chartered Institute for IT\".<ref name=\"rebrand\">\n{{cite journal |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/1828171/bcs-the-chartered-institute-it |title= BCS becomes The Chartered Institute for IT |first=Dave |last=Bailey |date=21 September 2009 |publisher=British Computer Society |journal=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref> In 2010, an [[Extraordinary General Meeting]] was called to discuss the direction of the BCS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yourfuture.bcs.org/ |title=BCS \u2013 Building for your Future |publisher=British Computer Society |year=2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528093404/http://yourfuture.bcs.org/ |archivedate=28 May 2010 }}</ref> The debate has been covered by the computing press.<ref>{{cite news | first=Bill |last=Goodwin |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/read-all-about-it/2010/04/the-egm-debate-bcs-v-len-keigh.html |title=The EGM debate: BCS v Len Keighley |publisher=[[Computer Weekly]] |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Maxwell |last=Cooter |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060410-bcs-membership-fights-over.html |title=BCS membership fights over direction |journal=[[Network World]] |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607071255/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060410-bcs-membership-fights-over.html |archivedate=7 June 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Simon |last=Phipps |url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/community/blogs/index.cfm?blogid=41&entryid=3026 |title=BCS EGM: It's Time To Vote For Transparency |journal=[[Computerworld]] UK |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Oates |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/21/bcs_rebel/ |title=BCS trustee threatens rebels with libel action |work=[[The Register]] |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nBCS is governed by a [[Trustee]] Board comprising the President, the Deputy President, the immediate past President, up to nine Vice Presidents (including Vice-President Finance), and five Professional Members elected by the Advisory Council.<ref name=\"Boards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bcs.org/category/13817 |title=Boards and Committees |website=British Computer Society |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> Sir [[Maurice Wilkes]], Professor of Computer Science at Cambridge University, served as its first president.

However, the BCS no longer offers [[Chartered Scientist]] status (''CSci'')\n* Members may also apply through BCS to the [[European Federation of National Engineering Associations]] (FEANI) for [[European Engineer]] (''Eur Ing'') status.\n\n;Designatory (post-nominal) letters\nMembers are encouraged to display the designatory letters to which they are entitled whenever appropriate. The order of designatory (post-nominal) letters is complex and open to a certain amount of interpretation. The accepted authority on this subject is ''Debrett\u2019s Correct Form''. Normally these should appear after decorations, degrees and chartered letters. Members holding CEng should also display the designatory letters of the institution through which they are registered immediately after the CEng. Conventionally, members holding Chartered status ([[Chartered IT Professional|CITP]]) display this immediately after their membership letters (e.g., FBCS CITP or MBCS CITP). However, as CITP may now be awarded by other organisations it may also be displayed separately, following that of the awarding institution.\n\nSome examples of BCS-related post-nominals:\n\n* Mr Frank James [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]], FBCS.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, [[Master of Science|MSc]], [[CEng]], MBCS, MIET.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] ([[Honours degree|Hons]]), MBCS, CITP.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, MSc, [[Chartered Scientist|CSci]], MIET, CITP.\n* Mr Frank James MBE, [[Master of Science|MSc]], MCGI, [[CEng]], MBCS, FEDIPAdvPra.\n\n==Awards==\nThe society provides several awards to recognize outstanding computer scientists, engineers, experienced and young IT professionals.\nThe awards include:\n\n* [[Lovelace Medal]]\n* [[Roger Needham Award]]\n* Early Career Award\n* John Perry Prize\n* Distinguished Dissertation Award\n* UK Industry Award\n\n==Qualifications==\nBCS provides a range of qualifications both for users of computers and [[Information technology|IT]] professionals.\n\n===BCS IT User Qualifications===\nBCS offers qualifications that cover all areas of IT, including understanding Spreadsheets and Presentation Software, Animation, Video Editing and Social Networking safety.<ref>IT User Qualifications: http://www.bcs.org/category/14405</ref>\n\nThe current IT user qualifications are:\n\n[[File:ECDL ft rgb2.jpg|200px|right]]\n*[[European Computer Driving Licence]] (ECDL) - BCS is the only organisation licensed to offer ECDL qualifications in the UK.\n*[[European Computer Driving Licence#ECDL Advanced|Advanced ECDL]] - the advanced course of ECDL (\"Advanced ECDL\") has four sections, each a qualification in its own right.
