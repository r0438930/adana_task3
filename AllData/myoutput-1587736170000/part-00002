McCarthy wrote the script for Johan Grimonprez's feature film ''Double Take'' (2009). The script consists of a short story, loosely based on Borges's '25 August 1983', in which Hitchcock meets his double on the set of one of his films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386926/ |title=Double Take (2009)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> The film won the Black Pearl award (MEIFF, Abu Dhabi) in 2009.

Eight and a half million pounds richer due to a compensation settlement but hopelessly estranged from the world around him, ''Remainder'''s protagonist spends his time and money obsessively reconstructing and re-enacting vaguely remembered scenes and situations from his past, such as a large building with piano music in the distance, the familiar smells and sounds of liver frying and spluttering, or lethargic cats lounging on roofs until they tumble off them. These re-enactments are driven by a need to inhabit the world \"authentically\" rather than in the \"second-hand\" manner that his traumatic situation has bequeathed him. When the recreation of mundane events fails to quench this thirst for authenticity, he starts re-enacting more and more violent events.\n\n===''Men in Space''===\nSet in a Central Europe rapidly fragmenting after the fall of Communism, ''Men in Space'' follows a cast of dissolute Bohemians, political refugees, football referees, deaf police agents, assassins and stranded astronauts as they chase a stolen icon painting from Sofia to Prague and beyond. The icon's melancholy orbit is reflected in the various characters' ellipses and near-misses as they career vertiginously through all kinds of space, be it physical, political, emotional or metaphysical. McCarthy uses these settings to present a vision of humanity adrift in history, and a world in a state of disintegration.\n\n===''C''===\nOpening in England at the turn of the twentieth century, ''C'' is the story of a boy named Serge Carrefax, whose father spends his time experimenting with wireless communication while running a school for deaf children. Serge grows up amid the noise and silence with his brilliant but troubled older sister, Sophie: an intense sibling relationship that stays with him as he heads off into an equally troubled larger world. After a fling with a nurse at a Bohemian spa, Serge serves in World War I as a radio operator for reconnaissance planes. When his plane is shot down, Serge is taken to a German prison camp, from which he escapes. Back in London, he's recruited for a mission to Cairo on behalf of the shadowy Empire Wireless Chain.\n\nMcCarthy's novel ''C'' was released in late 2010, in the US with Knopf, in the UK with Jonathan Cape. It divided critics.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/7913342/Peter-Carey-could-be-three-time-Booker-winner.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Stephen | last=Adams | title=Peter Carey could be three-time Booker winner | date=27 July 2010}}</ref>\nMcCarthy has described this novel in previous interviews as dealing with technology and mourning.

The telephone was displayed in the FiAC collection in Paris, and purchased by gallerists/collectors Solene Guillier and Nathalie Boutin. McCarthy wrote the script for Johan Grimonprez's feature film ''Double Take'' (2009). The script consists of a short story, loosely based on Borges's '25 August 1983', in which Hitchcock meets his double on the set of one of his films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386926/ |title=Double Take (2009)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> The film won the Black Pearl award (MEIFF, Abu Dhabi) in 2009.

Eight and a half million pounds richer due to a compensation settlement but hopelessly estranged from the world around him, ''Remainder'''s protagonist spends his time and money obsessively reconstructing and re-enacting vaguely remembered scenes and situations from his past, such as a large building with piano music in the distance, the familiar smells and sounds of liver frying and spluttering, or lethargic cats lounging on roofs until they tumble off them. These re-enactments are driven by a need to inhabit the world \"authentically\" rather than in the \"second-hand\" manner that his traumatic situation has bequeathed him. When the recreation of mundane events fails to quench this thirst for authenticity, he starts re-enacting more and more violent events.\n\n===''Men in Space''===\nSet in a Central Europe rapidly fragmenting after the fall of Communism, ''Men in Space'' follows a cast of dissolute Bohemians, political refugees, football referees, deaf police agents, assassins and stranded astronauts as they chase a stolen icon painting from Sofia to Prague and beyond. The icon's melancholy orbit is reflected in the various characters' ellipses and near-misses as they career vertiginously through all kinds of space, be it physical, political, emotional or metaphysical. McCarthy uses these settings to present a vision of humanity adrift in history, and a world in a state of disintegration.\n\n===''C''===\nOpening in England at the turn of the twentieth century, ''C'' is the story of a boy named Serge Carrefax, whose father spends his time experimenting with wireless communication while running a school for deaf children. Serge grows up amid the noise and silence with his brilliant but troubled older sister, Sophie: an intense sibling relationship that stays with him as he heads off into an equally troubled larger world. After a fling with a nurse at a Bohemian spa, Serge serves in World War I as a radio operator for reconnaissance planes. When his plane is shot down, Serge is taken to a German prison camp, from which he escapes. Back in London, he's recruited for a mission to Cairo on behalf of the shadowy Empire Wireless Chain.\n\nMcCarthy's novel ''C'' was released in late 2010, in the US with Knopf, in the UK with Jonathan Cape. It divided critics.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/7913342/Peter-Carey-could-be-three-time-Booker-winner.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Stephen | last=Adams | title=Peter Carey could be three-time Booker winner | date=27 July 2010}}</ref>\nMcCarthy has described this novel in previous interviews as dealing with technology and mourning.
