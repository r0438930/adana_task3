The concert had been professionally recorded in mono by radio engineers with a recording mike added onto Rory Storm's concert mike stand, but only one mike for the entire band.   The diary of Storm's guitarist [[Johnny Guitar]] reveals that in the week of the recording Ringo Starr was ill, and historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] has stated that the drumming on the recording is nothing like Starr's.  Four home [[demo (music)|demos]] were also included on the CD release.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Discography==\n(releases by Rory Storm and the Hurricanes)\n===Singles===\n* 1963 \u2013 \"Dr. Feel Good\" b/w \"I Can Tell\", [[Oriole Records (UK)|Oriole]], CB 1858<ref>[http://www.45cat.com/record/cb1858 Oriole CB 1858 on 45cat]</ref>\n* 1964 \u2013 \"[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]\" b/w \"Since You Broke My Heart\", [[Parlophone]], R 5197 <ref>[http://www.45cat.com/record/r5197 Parlophone R 5197 on 45cat]</ref>\n\n===Albums===\n* 2012 \u2013 ''Live at the Jive Hive March 1960'', Rockstar Records, RSRCD 033<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Rory-Storm-And-The-Hurricanes-Live-At-The-Jive-Hive/release/3836593 ''Jive at the Jive Hive March 1960'' at Discogs] Retrieved 13 May 2013</ref>\n\n===Compilations===\n* 1963 \u2013 ''This Is Merseybeat volume 1'', [[Oriole Records (UK)|Oriole]], PS 40047 (tracks: \"Dr. Feel Good\" and \"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")<ref>[http://rateyourmusic.com/release/comp/various_artists_f2/this_is_merseybeat_vol__1/ ''This Is Merseybeat volume 1'' on Rate Your Music]</ref>\n* 1963 \u2013 ''This Is Merseybeat volume 2'', Oriole, PS 40048 (tracks: \"I Can Tell\")<ref>[http://rateyourmusic.com/release/comp/various_artists_f2/this_is_merseybeat_vol__2/ ''This Is Merseybeat volume 2'' on Rate Your Music]</ref>\n* 1974 \u2013 ''Mersey Beat 1962\u201364'', [[United Artists]], USD 305 (tracks: \"I Can Tell\", \"Dr. Feel Good\")<ref>[http://rateyourmusic.com/release/comp/various_artists_f2/mersey_beat_1962___64/ ''Mersey Beat 1962\u201364'' on Rate Your Music]</ref>\n* 2004 \u2013 ''Unearthed Merseybeat Volume 2'', Viper CD-027 (tracks: \"[[Lend Me Your Comb]]\")<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.the-viper-label.co.uk/releases/027/027-T.html |title=''Unearthed Merseybeat Volume 2'' on The Viper Label website |access-date=22 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227223143/http://www.the-viper-label.co.uk/releases/027/027-T.html |archive-date=27 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|author=Epstein, Brian|title=A Cellarful of Noise|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1964|isbn=978-0-671-01196-3|ref={{SfnRef|Epstein|1964}}|authorlink=Brian Epstein}}\n* {{cite book|first=Bill|last=Harry|authorlink=Bill Harry|title=The Beatles Encyclopedia: Revised and Updated|year=2000|publisher=Virgin Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-7535-0481-9|ref={{SfnRef|Harry|2000}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Lennon|first=Cynthia|authorlink=Cynthia Lennon|title=John|publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-340-89512-2|ref={{SfnRef|Lennon|2005}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Miles|first=Barry|authorlink=Barry Miles|title=The Beatles Diary|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7119-6315-3|ref={{SfnRef|Miles|1997}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Spitz|first=Bob|title=The Beatles: The Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/beatlesbiography00spit|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] (New York)|year=2005|isbn=978-0-316-80352-6|ref={{SfnRef|Spitz|2005}}}}\n* {{cite book|author= The Beatles Anthology|authorlink=The Beatles|title=[[The Beatles Anthology]] (DVD)|publisher=[[Apple records]]|year=2003|id=ASIN \u2013 B00008GKEG}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hogan|first=Anthony|title=From a storm to a Hurricane|publisher=[[Amberley Publishing]]|year=2016|isbn= 978-1-445-6563-28|ref={{SfnRef|Storm|2016}}}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rory-storm-mn0001348816 Rory Storm and the Hurricanes at Allmusic]\n* [http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/rory_storm_and_the_hurricanes Rory Storm and the Hurricanes at Rate Your Music]\n* [http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rory+Storm+%26+The+Hurricanes?noanv=1 Rory Storm and the Hurricanes at Discogs]\n\n{{Ringo Starr main}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Storm, Rory}}\n[[Category:1938 births]]\n[[Category:1972 deaths]]\n[[Category:English pop musicians]]\n[[Category:English male singers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Parlophone artists]]\n[[Category:Oriole Records (UK) artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century English singers]]\n[[Category:English rock singers]]\n[[Category:Alcohol-related deaths in England]]\n[[Category:Drug-related deaths in England]]\n[[Category:English expatriates in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n[[Category:Rory Storm and the Hurricanes members]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toAthletics(link changed toSport of athletics) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Storm"}
