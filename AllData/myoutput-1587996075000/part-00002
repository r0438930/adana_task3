The first part of the name \"Chattanooga\" derives from the [[Muskogean]] word ''cvto'' /ch\u1eaft\u022f/ \u2013 'rock'.<ref>A Dictionary of Creek/Muskogee, Margaret McKane Mauldin</ref> The latter may be derived from a regional suffix ''-nuga'' meaning dwelling or dwelling place. It is also believed to be derived from the Creek Indian word for \u2018rock rising to a point.\u2019\n\nThe earliest Cherokee occupation of the area dates from 1776, when [[Dragging Canoe]] separated himself from the main tribe to establish resistance to European settlement during the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]]. In 1816 [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who later became [[Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation|Principal Chief]], established [[Ross's Landing]]. Located along what is now Broad Street, it became one of the centers of Cherokee Nation settlement, which also extended into Georgia and Alabama.<ref name=tehc />\n\nIn 1838, the U.S. government forced the Cherokees, along with other Native Americans, to relocate to the area designated as [[Indian Territory]], in what is now the state of [[Oklahoma]]. Their journey west became known as the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\" for their exile and fatalities along the way. The U.S. Army used Ross's Landing as the site of one of three large internment camps, or \"emigration depots\", where Native Americans were held before the journey on the Trail of Tears.<ref name=vott>Vicki Rozema, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7zgcpmg8vcC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=trail+of+tears,+emigration+depots&source=bl&ots=jx60asMNZF&sig=GQuHws155HTp72arN8yGG1_otm8&hl=en&ei=vFCMSpazLcyBtgeJyMTkBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Voices from the Trail of Tears].

The city grew quickly, initially benefiting from a location well-suited for river commerce. With the arrival of the railroad in 1850, Chattanooga became a boom town.

The next day, the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain]] was fought, driving the Confederates off the mountain. On November 25, Grant's army routed the Confederates in the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]]. In regard to victories won by the Union, Chattanooga marks one of three defining moments that turned the Civil War in their favor.

They were hired again on a permanent basis beginning on August 11, 1948, years before other major cities in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], integrated their police departments. The first seven black officers in 1948, Thaddeus Arnold, Singer Askins, W.B. Baulridge, C.E.

The first part of the name \"Chattanooga\" derives from the [[Muskogean]] word ''cvto'' /ch\u1eaft\u022f/ \u2013 'rock'.<ref>A Dictionary of Creek/Muskogee, Margaret McKane Mauldin</ref> The latter may be derived from a regional suffix ''-nuga'' meaning dwelling or dwelling place. It is also believed to be derived from the Creek Indian word for \u2018rock rising to a point.\u2019\n\nThe earliest Cherokee occupation of the area dates from 1776, when [[Dragging Canoe]] separated himself from the main tribe to establish resistance to European settlement during the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]]. In 1816 [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who later became [[Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation|Principal Chief]], established [[Ross's Landing]]. Located along what is now Broad Street, it became one of the centers of Cherokee Nation settlement, which also extended into Georgia and Alabama.<ref name=tehc />\n\nIn 1838, the U.S. government forced the Cherokees, along with other Native Americans, to relocate to the area designated as [[Indian Territory]], in what is now the state of [[Oklahoma]]. Their journey west became known as the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\" for their exile and fatalities along the way. The U.S. Army used Ross's Landing as the site of one of three large internment camps, or \"emigration depots\", where Native Americans were held before the journey on the Trail of Tears.<ref name=vott>Vicki Rozema, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7zgcpmg8vcC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=trail+of+tears,+emigration+depots&source=bl&ots=jx60asMNZF&sig=GQuHws155HTp72arN8yGG1_otm8&hl=en&ei=vFCMSpazLcyBtgeJyMTkBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Voices from the Trail of Tears].

The city grew quickly, initially benefiting from a location well-suited for river commerce. With the arrival of the railroad in 1850, Chattanooga became a boom town.

The next day, the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain]] was fought, driving the Confederates off the mountain. On November 25, Grant's army routed the Confederates in the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]]. In regard to victories won by the Union, Chattanooga marks one of three defining moments that turned the Civil War in their favor.

They were hired again on a permanent basis beginning on August 11, 1948, years before other major cities in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], integrated their police departments. The first seven black officers in 1948, Thaddeus Arnold, Singer Askins, W.B. Baulridge, C.E.
