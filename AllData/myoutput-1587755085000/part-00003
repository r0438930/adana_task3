In general, however, \"stupa\" is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or [[Southeast Asia]] while \"pagoda\" refers to a building in East Asia which can be entered and which may be used for secular purposes. However, use of the term varies by region. For example, stupas in Burma tend to be referred to as \"pagodas.\"\n\nStupas were built in [[Sri Lanka]] soon after [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] converted to Buddhism. The first stupa to be built was the [[Thuparamaya]].

Rinpoche went on to build 16 more stupas in Europe before his death in 2003.\n\nA stupa was built on the ground of the Kalachakra Kalapa Centre in southwest [[Styria]], [[Austria]], between 2000 and 2002.\n\nA stupa based on the bell shaped stupas at [[Borobudur|Boropodur]], Central Java, is located at [[Amaravati Buddhist Monastery]] near [[Hemel Hempstead]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhamind.info/leftside/arty/progress/stupas.htm|title=Stupa construction at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery|last=friends|first=Venerable Kusalo Bhikkhu - with help from his teachers and|website=www.buddhamind.info|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>\n\n===Types of stupas===\n[[File:Boudha Stupa 2018 04.jpg|thumb|[[Boudhanath Stupa]], [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]\nBuilt for a variety of reasons, Buddhist stupas are classified based on form and function into five types:<ref name=\"Phuoc2010\">{{cite book|author=Le Huu Phuoc|title=Buddhist Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&pg=PA140|accessdate=8 December 2011|date=March 2010|publisher=Grafikol|isbn=978-0-9844043-0-8|page=140}}</ref>\n* '''Relic stupa''', in which the relics or remains of the Buddha, his disciples, and lay saints are interred.\n* '''Object stupa''', in which the items interred are objects belonged to the Buddha or his disciples, such as a begging bowl or robe, or important Buddhist scriptures.\n* '''Commemorative stupa''', built to commemorate events in the lives of Buddha or his disciples.\n* '''Symbolic stupa''', to symbolise aspects of Buddhist theology; for example, Borobudur is considered to be the symbol of \"the Three Worlds (''dhatu'') and the spiritual stages (''bhumi'') in a Mahayana ''bodhisattva's'' character.\"<ref name=\"Phuoc2010\"/>\n* '''Votive stupa''', constructed to commemorate visits or to gain spiritual benefits, usually at the site of prominent stupas which are regularly visited.\n\n==Symbolism==\n[[File:Grand Palace Bangkok.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Wat Phra Kaew]] complex from the northeast, temple complex of the Emerald Buddha with stupas.]]\n\n\"The shape of the stupa represents the Buddha, crowned and sitting in meditation posture on a lion throne.

Sometimes the type is chosen directly connected with events that have taken place in the area.<ref name=\"KUC\">{{cite web | title=Miracle Stupa - Stupa | url=http://www.stupa.pl/en_stupa.html | publisher=stupa.pl | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:EndAscetism.JPG|thumb|The sharing of the relics of the Buddha.

These surviving relics are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar.]]\n\n===Treasury===\nAll stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called ''tsatsa''s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\nThe number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the [[Kalachakra stupa]] in southern [[Spain]] contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n[[Jewellery]] and other \"precious\" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Tree of Life===\nAn important element in every stupa is the \"Tree of Life\". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way the stupa is charged, and starts to function.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Benefits===\nBuilding a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled.<ref name=\"SBEN\">{{cite web | title=Benefits Resulting from the Building of Stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/benefit.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the goal of Buddhism.<ref name=\"SBEN\"/>\n\nDestroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing.<ref name=\"LTR4\">Article: Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche: ''The Four Thoughts which Turn the Mind from Samsara.''

There are eight different kinds of stupas in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], each referring to major events in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s life.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Lotus Blossom Stupa===\nAlso known as \"Stupa of Heaped Lotuses\" or \"Birth of the Sugata Stupa,\" this stupa refers to the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. \"At birth Buddha took seven steps in each of the four directions\"<ref name=\"Beer\">Beer, Robert: The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs (2004) Serindia Publications Inc. {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}}</ref> (East, South, West and North). In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the [[brahmavihara|brahmavih\u0101ras]]: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Enlightenment Stupa===\n[[File:Ogoy Stupa 1 1600x1200.JPG|thumb|left|Enlightenment Stupa at [[Ogoy Island]], [[Russia]]]]\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of the Conquest of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]\", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in [[Bodh Gaya]], where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Many Doors===\nThis stupa is also known as the \"Stupa of Many Gates\". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near [[Sarnath]]. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the [[Four Noble Truths]], the Six [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas]].<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===\nAt 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the [[Tushita|Tu\u1e63ita Heaven]] where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in [[Sankassa]] in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Great Miracles===\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of Conquest of the [[Tirthika]]s\", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered ''maras'' and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichavi]] kingdom to commemorate the event.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Reconciliation===\nThis stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Complete Victory===\nThis stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months. It has only three steps, which are circular and unadorned.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Nirvana===\nThis stupa refers to the death of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his complete absorption into the highest state of mind. It is bell-shaped and usually unornamented.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n==Kalachakra stupa==\n{{Main|Kalachakra stupa}}\n\nA ninth kind of stupa exists, the [[Kalachakra stupa]]. Its symbolism is not connected to events in the Buddha's life, but instead to the symbolism of the [[Kalachakra Tantra]], created to protect against negative energies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kalachakra Stupa |url=http://www.karmaguen.org/stupa_kalachakra_en.html |publisher=karmaguen.org |accessdate=2009-04-18 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205055317/http://www.karmaguen.org/stupa_kalachakra_en.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Swat District==\n[[Swat District]], Pakistan, is a small place with a large number of ancient stupas.

Columbia University Press</ref> The pagoda has varied forms that also include bell-shaped and pyramidal styles. In the Western context, there is no clear distinction between a stupa and a pagoda. In general, however, \"stupa\" is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or [[Southeast Asia]] while \"pagoda\" refers to a building in East Asia which can be entered and which may be used for secular purposes. However, use of the term varies by region. For example, stupas in Burma tend to be referred to as \"pagodas.\"\n\nStupas were built in [[Sri Lanka]] soon after [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] converted to Buddhism. The first stupa to be built was the [[Thuparamaya]]. Later, many more were built over the years, some like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], being one of the tallest ancient structures in the world.\n\n====Development of the Pagoda====\nThe Asian words for [[pagoda]] (''t\u0101'' in Chinese, ''t'ap'' in Korean, ''th\u00e1p'' in Vietnamese, ''t\u014d'' in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the [[Pali]] word for stupa, '''''thupa''''', the [[Sanskrit]] pronunciation being ''stupa''.<ref>Buddhist architecture, p.183</ref> In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second [[Kanishka stupa]] (4th century), is thought to be the precussor of the tower stupas in [[Turkestan]] and the Chinese pagodas such as [[Songyue Pagoda]] (523 CE).<ref name=\"Buddhist architecture, p.180\">Buddhist architecture, p.180</ref>\n\n==Notable stupas==\n[[File:Borobudur temple panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borobudur]] bell-shaped stupas.]]\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE.

The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment.

These surviving relics are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar.]]\n\n===Treasury===\nAll stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called ''tsatsa''s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\nThe number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the [[Kalachakra stupa]] in southern [[Spain]] contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n[[Jewellery]] and other \"precious\" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Tree of Life===\nAn important element in every stupa is the \"Tree of Life\". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way the stupa is charged, and starts to function.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Benefits===\nBuilding a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled.<ref name=\"SBEN\">{{cite web | title=Benefits Resulting from the Building of Stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/benefit.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the goal of Buddhism.<ref name=\"SBEN\"/>\n\nDestroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing.<ref name=\"LTR4\">Article: Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche: ''The Four Thoughts which Turn the Mind from Samsara.''

In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the [[brahmavihara|brahmavih\u0101ras]]: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Enlightenment Stupa===\n[[File:Ogoy Stupa 1 1600x1200.JPG|thumb|left|Enlightenment Stupa at [[Ogoy Island]], [[Russia]]]]\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of the Conquest of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]\", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in [[Bodh Gaya]], where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Many Doors===\nThis stupa is also known as the \"Stupa of Many Gates\". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near [[Sarnath]]. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the [[Four Noble Truths]], the Six [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas]].<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===\nAt 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the [[Tushita|Tu\u1e63ita Heaven]] where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in [[Sankassa]] in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Great Miracles===\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of Conquest of the [[Tirthika]]s\", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered ''maras'' and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichavi]] kingdom to commemorate the event.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Reconciliation===\nThis stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Complete Victory===\nThis stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months.
