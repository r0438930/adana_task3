The key finding shows that the named figures had not taken disciplinary cases seriously and intended for it to reflect badly on the leader. There is a report of a senior governance executive \"fabricat[ing] a case\" against people \"she doesn't like\", and one staffer admitted that \"real work\" was \"piling up\" while they \"were engaged in inappropriate factional work\". In the period between November 2016 and February 2018 the figures named in the report, who were in charge of member disciplinary procedures, had only taken action on 16% of all complaints made about members engaging in antisemitism.\n\nIn addition to this, there are clear examples of the named figures using insulting, derogatory and aggressive language towards Labour politicians, staff and members. This includes terms like \"trots\", \"bitch face cow\", \"fucking twats\". They repeatedly used derogatory mental health tropes, including terms like \"mentalist\" and \"nutter\", and repeatedly disparaged the appearance of party staff and members, using terms like \"pube head\", \"smelly cow\" and \"fat\". They also made comments saying that that certain party members should \"die in a fire\" and that a senior aide's \"face would make a good dartboard\". Labour MPs were also targets as they said that those MPs who nominated Corbyn should be \"taken out and shot\" amongst other disparaging remarks. Labour politicians who were insulted in the comments were: [[Ed Miliband]], [[Sadiq Khan]], [[Dawn Butler]], [[Diane Abbott]], [[Rachael Maskell]], [[Clive Lewis (politician)|Clive Lewis]], and [[Jeremy Corbyn]]. They also expressed anti-black racism and sympathy towards Islamophobic tropes. \n\nThere is also talk of violence against [[Jeremy Corbyn]]; talking about \"hanging and burning\" Corbyn, calling him a \"lying little toerag\", claiming \"death is too kind for LOTO ['Leader Of The Opposition']\". Senior management were found to be telling staff that they need not be \"comradely\" in their attitudes and statements about the leader.\n\nThere were constant talks of hoping Labour loses key elections in order to instigating a coup and remove Corbyn as leader. There were statements expressing that Labour should on the losing side for the [[2016 United Kingdom local elections|2016 local elections]] and [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]]. Furthermore, there is overwhelming evidence of the senior management obstructing party efforts to win the [[2017 United Kingdom general election]] in order to remove Corbyn. The management team co-ordinated in \"refusing to share basic information to LOTO during the election\", created a \"parallel general election campaign\" and boasted about \"hardly working\" during the campaign. There are marked statements about their dismay at Labour over-performing expectations during the campaign, and apparent disappointment with the increase in seats after the election.\n\n== Reaction ==\nMany MPs, party members and activists within the Labour Party expressed dismay at the contents of the report. Many Labour politicians across the party's spectrum spoke out against the emails and practices revealed in the report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AndyBurnhamGM/status/1249424188454076421?s=20|title=Yes, Ben, seems right to me.
