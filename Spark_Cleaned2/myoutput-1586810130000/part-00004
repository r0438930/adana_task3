For this he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]], among other awards. He earned the nickname \"Silent Otto\" both for his successful use of the \"[[Silent running (submarine)|silent running]]\" capability of U-boats as well as for his reluctance to transmit radio messages during patrols. After the war, he served in the German Federal Navy and retired in 1970 with the rank of ''Flottillenadmiral'' (flotilla admiral).\n\n==Early life and career==\nKretschmer was born in [[Hajduki Nyskie|Heidau]] near [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], then in the [[German Empire]] on 1 May 1912 to Friedrich Wilhelm Otto and Alice new Herbig.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=1}} His father was a teacher at the local ''Volkschule'' ([[primary school]]) where Otto attended from 1918\u20131921. He then moved to a ''Realgymnasium'' ([[secondary school]]).{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=1}} In the aftermath of [[World War I]] the Kretschmer family remained aloof from the political turbulence of the [[Weimar era]]. Kretschmer indulged in sporting pastimes and scientific interests. Kretschmer achieved good results in mathematics and chemistry and passed his ''[[Abitur]]'' (school-leaving certificate) at 17. The report contained the remark, \"Kretschmer demonstrated his extraordinary courage in many instances. He wants to be a naval officer.\"{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=2}} Kretschmer was too young to enlist at 17 and his father sent him to [[England]] to broaden his horizons. He enrolled at [[Exeter University]] (then University College of the South West of England) and studied under Professor Jacob Wilhelm Schopp (b. 1871), a German\u2013born naturalised Briton. He mastered the [[English language]] and came to respect British education, its practical focus complemented his scientific and theoretical\u2013based German background. His time in England shaped his view of them during the war; he was quick to believe in rumours of new British inventions during the war at sea.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=2\u20134}} He returned home upon his mother's death from tetanus in a medical malpractice incident. He did not return to England from his hiatus, but travelled through [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=2\u20134}}\n\n===''Reichsmarine''===\n\nKretschmer entered the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (Weimar Navy) on 1 April 1930 as ''See Offizier Anw\u00e4rter'' (naval officer cadet). Kretschmer formed part of \"Crew 30\" (the incoming class of 1930), 78\u2013strong intake of officer candidates.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=3}} He underwent basic military training in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Stralsund]] (1 April 1930&nbsp;\u2013 30 June 1930).<ref group=Tr>2nd department \u2014II.

Following a 14-month stay onboard the [[German cruiser Emden|cruiser ''Emden'']] (10 October 1930&nbsp;\u2013 4 January 1932), he advanced in rank to ''[[F\u00e4hnrich zur See]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 January 1932.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=41}}{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=5\u20137}} The global cruise on ''Emden'' took Kretschmer to the [[Far East]] through the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Suez canal]]. The ship made stops in [[Ceylon]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Stops were made in [[Guam]], [[South Africa]], [[Angola]] and [[Spain]] on the return journey.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=8}} The ''Emden'' returned to [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 2 December 1931.

The establishment of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (Nazi German Armed Forces) in 1935 divided the major branches of the armed forces. The ''Reichsmarine'' was renamed the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', a Nazi creation. The [[OKM]] was established as the supreme command of the navy responsible for all facets of [[naval warfare]]. The renaming of the navy was a symbolic gesture, to erase the unpleasant memories of the 1920s and symbolise a new era.{{sfn|Thomas|1990|p=110}} According to one historian, Kretschmer was a patriot and loyal to the government, but later \"eschewed Nazi efforts to glorify his success through [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]].\"{{sfn|Zabecki|1999|p=380}}\n\nDuring Kretschmer's stay on ''K\u00f6ln'', he attended an [[aircraft catapult]] course at [[Travem\u00fcnde]].<ref group=Tr>aircraft catapult course \u2014''Katapultlehrgang''</ref> On 26 September 1935, he was transferred to the 1st department of the standing ship division of the North Sea in Wilhelmshaven where he served as a company officer until 25 January 1936.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=42}} Kretschmer joined the U-boat service in January 1936.

R\u00f6sing brought his own watch officer, and Kretschmer was demoted to second watch officer. While discharging his responsibilities for the operational readiness of the deck gun, R\u00f6sing dived leaving Kretschmer stranded in the freezing water. He clung to the periscope in the hope of being seen through the optics. Kretschmer was soon missed and the boat surfaced to find him before he succumbed to the cold.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nHe was given interim command of ''U-35'' in August 1937, and this appointment coincided with [[German involvement in the Spanish Civil War|Germany's involvement]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The boat was ordered to patrol the [[Bay of Biscay]] off the Spanish-French border. The crew were permitted ashore at the resort town of [[San Sebastian]]. R\u00f6sing's successor, Hermann Michahelles was killed in a car accident and Kretschmer assumed command for two weeks.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=14\u201315}} ''U-35'' returned to Germany after an uneventful patrol during which no ships were sunk. On 1 October 1937, Kretschmer took command of {{GS|U-23|1936|2}}.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=14}} Through the remaining [[Interwar period]], Kretschmer developed his own approach to combat. He dispensed with the standard practice of firing salvos, instead he practiced a \"one torpedo one ship\" policy as a means to achieving utmost efficiency with munitions. Kretschmer favoured surfaced attacks as opposed to the recommended submerged engagement.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=15\u201319}} Kretschmer was promoted to ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' ([[captain lieutenant]]) on 1 June 1939.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=42}}\n\n==World War II==\n===''U-23'': Patrols 1\u20138===\nThe [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939 began the war in Europe. [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]],  [[Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote]] (BdU), ordered attacks on Allied shipping at sea, beginning the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. The short range of the [[Type II submarine]] allowed for operations in the North Sea, but no further.\n\n[[File:U-9 IWM HU 1012.jpg|thumb|left|A [[German Type II submarine#Type IIB|Type IIB]] U-boat similar to ''U-23'']]\nKretschmer and ''U-23'' had departed from Wilhelmshaven on 25 August, one week before the start of World War II.

Kretschmer sank six and disabled a seventh.{{sfn|Milner|2011|pp=40\u20134}} Kretschmer recommended his [[helmsman]] ''[[Stabsfeldwebel|Stabsobersteuermann]]'' [[Heinrich Petersen (naval officer)|Heinrich Petersen]] for the Knight's Cross after twelve war patrols for saving ''U-99'' from enemy detection. The nomination was approved on 5 November 1940. Petersen had served as Kretschmer's helmsman on every war patrol on both ''U-23'' and ''U-99''.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=97}}\n\nIn November and December 1940 ''U-99'' sank three British [[Armed Merchant Cruiser|armed merchant cruisers]] (AMC), [[SS Laurentic (1927)|HMS ''Laurentic'']], [[SS Patroclus (1923)|HMS ''Patroclus'']] and {{HMS|Forfar|F30|6}}. ''Laurentic'' and ''Patroclus'' were attacked on the night of 3/4 November.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|pp=35, 37}} 51 men died aboard ''Laurentic'', 367 survived. ''Patroclus'' lost 56 crew; 230 survived.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=68}} Kretschmer was awarded the 6th [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub}}) on 4 November 1940.{{sfn|Scherzer|2007|p=474}} ''U-99'' docked four days later, concluding Kretschmer's fourteenth patrol after just ten days at sea.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=255}} Upon reaching port, he was summoned to Berlin to meet [[Erich Raeder]]. He was given the opportunity to convey his opinions on the state of the U-boat war. Kretschmer purportedly confined his remarks to the lack of air support from the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', a point Raeder was fully aware. Kretschmer then met Hitler at the [[Reich Chancellery]] and he repeated his opinions on the war situation. Hitler invited Kretschmer to sit in on a lunch meeting with Hitler and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s ambassador to the Third Reich. Kretschmer's thoughts on Hitler and the subsequent conference are not known.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||pp=161\u2013162}}\n\nKretschmer departed for his fifteenth patrol on 27 November and returned on 12 December.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||p=255}} In December Kretschmer tried to intercept [[Convoy HX 90]] but encountered only stragglers.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=46}} ''Forfar'' was one and during the sinking, ''HMS Viscount'' appeared forcing Kretschmer to dive. He assumed most of the crew went down with the ship; but there were 159 survivors. 176 men died.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|pp=74, 76\u201377}} ''Laurentic'' and ''Patroclus'' had been loaded with wooden barrels to increase [[buoyancy]]. It took nine torpedoes and one dud to sink them; the latter was sunk after it stopped to pick up survivors from the former.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=72}} Kretschmer was forced to engage ''Patroclus'' with the deck gun when it appeared to resist the torpedo damage but retreated when the ship fired back. A [[Short Sunderland]] appeared briefly, and Kretschmer was forced to accomplish the destruction of the ship with torpedoes, submerged.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=72}} On 7 December 1940, Kretschmer sank the Dutch freighter ''[[List of shipwrecks in December 1940#7 December|Farmsum]]''; the last success of the year. The ship was loaded with coal, set for [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The ship sank slowly. Kretschmer learned its identity from frantic radio signals.{{sfn|Paterson|2018||pp=172\u2013173}}\n\n===Defeat and capture===\nSeveral of Kretschmer's senior officers departed the boat before the final patrol. [[Klaus Bargsten]] served aboard ''U-99'' under Kretschmer, before being promoted to captain himself and becoming the sole survivor of {{GS|U-521||2}} on 2 June 1942.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=67\u201370, 247}}\n\nOn 22 February 1941 ''U-99'' left Lorient for the final time. For 13 days Kretschmer sailed without success. ''U-99'' tried in vain to assist Prien in ''U-47'', against OB&nbsp;290. Prien achieved several sinkings, Kretschmer did not; the pair was chased off by destroyers. Prien's reports were picked up by the Luftwaffe which sent [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]]s from I. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' of [[Kampfgeschwader 40|''Kampfgeschwader'' 40]] (KG&nbsp;40\u201440th Bomber Wing) to attack the convoy. The air crews sank eight and damaged several more. Kretschmer continued to search for stragglers and found ''SS Holmlea''. He fired a single torpedo that missed before he lost the ship in thick mist. Prien sank the ship the following day. Prien and Kretschmer cooperated frequently during the course of this patrol - neither would complete it.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=184\u2013186}}\n\nThe operation against [[Convoy OB 293]] proved disastrous for the Lorient group. Prien, Kretschmer along with {{GS|U-70|1940|2}} (Matz) and {{GS|UA|1939|2}} attacked the convoy. The ships were protected by an escort group of two [[destroyer]]s, {{HMS|Wolverine|D78|2}} and {{HMS|Verity|D63|2}}, and two [[corvette]]s, {{HMS|Arbutus|K86|2}} and {{HMS|Camellia|K31|2}}.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|2005|p=62}} As with the group that would eventually sink Kretschmer ten days later, they were experienced and competent.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=52}} Kretschmer attempted a surface night attack using his favourite tactic.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=187\u2013190}} On 7 March Kretschmer sank two ships from the convoy including the {{GRT|20,638|link=off}} ''[[list of shipwrecks in March 1941#7 March|Terje Viken]]''.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=45}} Four ships were sunk, but two U-boats were sunk, one of them ''U-47''. Prien along with his crew disappeared, presumably in a depth charge attack.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|2005|pp=62\u201363}} British reports of the action mention a large red glow appearing deep below the surface amid the depth charge explosions.{{sfn|Terraine|1989|p=314}}\n\nOn 16 March 1941 Kretschmer attacked [[Convoy HX 112]]. Kretschmer sank all but one of the ships lost by the convoy.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=46}} During a counterattack by the escorts ''U-99'' was disabled after repeated [[depth charge]] attacks by the destroyers {{HMS|Walker|D27|2}} and {{HMS|Vanoc|H33|2}}.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=77}} ''U-99'' was driven down to 700 feet\u2014beyond the recognised [[crush depth]]\u2014 before control was regained and the ballast tanks blown.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} Kretschmer surfaced and, under fire from the British vessels, scuttled his boat. Three of his men were lost, but Kretschmer and the remainder of ''U-99''{{'}}s crew were captured. That same day the British escorts scored another success against the ''Kriegsmarine'' when the noted U-Boat skipper, [[Joachim Schepke]], was killed aboard {{GS|U-100|1940|2}}, having been depth charged, rammed and sunk by ''Vanoc''.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=77}}\n\nKretschmer's usual standards of conduct were evident during the sinking of his boat. One signalman sent a message to the escorts \"we are sinking\" and the firing stopped.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} He then sent a message to BdU, \"Two destroyers\u2014depth charges\u201450,000 tons\u2014Kretschmer.\"{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} Kretschmer signalled ''Walker'' asking for rescue for his men, taking care to ensure as many left the submarine as possible, and assisted some of his crew towards the rescue nets hung from the British destroyer. Kretschmer's strength was evidently failing in the cold ocean; his own rescue was at the hands of a British sailor who climbed down the nets and plucked him from the water.{{sfn|Padfield|1995|p=115}}\n\n===Prisoner of war===\nKretschmer and his crew were landed in [[Liverpool]]. They were sent to [[Lime Street Station]] to be transported to London for interrogation. Kretschmer was taken separately but his crew had to negotiate the streets of Liverpool and were subjected to missiles thrown by angry civilians; the city [[Liverpool Blitz|had been heavily bombed]] and was closely linked with the Atlantic war. He was transported to the [[London Cage]], a facility for [[MI19]] to hold valuable enemy prisoners. The building was located at number 8 [[Kensington Palace Gardens]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=230\u2013232}} [[Winston Churchill]] disclosed the capture of Kretschmer to the [[House of Commons]] on 21 March. German radio acknowledged the capture and the death of Schepke. Prien's demise was not disclosed. German propagandists feared the triple loss might be too damaging to morale.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=222}}\n\nOnce in London, Royal Navy interrogators questioned the crew. The report, filed in the archives, was named [http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"U 99\" Interrogation of Survivors April, 1941\"]. The British reported noted of Kretschmer, \"His political views were less extremely Nazi than had been assumed.\u00a0 On seeing the craters of a stick of bombs near [[Buckingham Palace]] he was genuinely shocked that an attempt had so obviously been made by his countrymen to bomb the Palace. He spoke English quite well, though he lacked practice.\u00a0 His whole demeanour was calm and quiet, and he seemed anxious to be friendly; he was also less suspicious of British Officers than was his First Lieutenant.\u00a0Kretschmer stated that he was unmarried.\"<ref>[http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"Interrogation of U-99 survivors\"]</ref>\n\nOf his personality and view of the war it stated, \"He gave the impression of being a quiet, deliberate man, and looked more like a student than a U-Boat Captain.\u00a0He prided himself on being able to take advantage of whatever the passing moment offered and made no elaborate plans for attacking convoys. He admitted that he had become weary of the war some time ago, and latterly had got no satisfaction from sinking ship after ship.\n\"<ref>[http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"Interrogation of U-99 survivors\"]</ref>\n\nFollowing his capture, Kretschmer spent almost seven years as a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) in the hands of the British at No1 POW camp [[Grizedale Hall]]  in [[Cumbria]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=202}} In March 1942, the prisoners were transported to Bowmanville Camp near [[Lake Ontario]] in [[Canada]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=230}} During his captivity, Kretschmer was promoted in rank to ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (corvette captain) on 19 March 1941, effective as of 1 March 1941, and to ''[[Fregattenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (frigate captain) on 1 September 1944. In addition, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern}}) on 26 December 1941. He was the fifth member of the German armed forces to be so honored.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=42}}\n\nOn 27 August 1941, [[HMS Graph|''U-570'']] was captured by the Royal Navy. The officers were also taken to the prisoner-of-war camp at Grizedale Hall.{{sfn|Blair|1998|p=347}} Kretschmer was senior officer at the camp. An illegal \"[[Court of Honor|Court of Honour]]\" was convened and headed by Kretschmer. They tried commander Hans-Joachim Rahmlow, ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', and ''U-570''{{'}}s other officers. Rahmlow and his second-in-command, Bernhard Berndt, were found \"guilty of cowardice\"; the other two officers were \"acquitted\". On the night of 18/19 October, Berndt escaped from the camp. A detachment of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] apprehended him, shooting him when he tried to escape. Allied courts and Rahmlow sought justice against Kretschmer after the war, but he was never vigorously pursued for trial for his role in the death of Berndt.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=222\u2013228, 238, 240}} Kretschmer was involved in a second illegal court of honour hearing against the commander of {{GS|U-501||2}}. Its commander, Hugo F\u00f6rster, was repatriated to Germany and committed suicide before the end of the war.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=228\u2013234}}\n\nIn 1943, the German command tried to rescue him (in [[Operation Kiebitz|Operation ''Kiebitz'']]) but that daring plan failed. Four of those years were spent in Canada at [[Bowmanville POW camp]]. Kretschmer was released from captivity on 31 December 1947 and returned to [[Germany]].{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=43}}\n\n==Postwar career, later life==\nIn 1955, Sir [[Donald Macintyre (Royal Navy officer)|Donald McIntyre]] returned Kretschmer's [[binoculars]], which he had kept in 1941. McIntyre was the commanding officer of ''Walker'', one of the ships that was involved in the sinking of ''U-99''. At the time, Kretschmer was president of the [[:de:Deutscher Marinebund|''Deutscher Marinebund'']], a member club of the [[International Maritime Confederation]].{{sfn|Der Spiegel Volume 46/1955}}\n\n[[File:Marinebundestreffen 1966 (Kiel 38.426).jpg|thumb|[[Flotilla admiral|''Flotillenadmiral'']] Kretschmer in 1966]]\nOn 1 December 1955, Kretschmer joined [[West Germany]]'s navy, at the time named the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' (Federal Navy), holding the rank of ''Fregattenkapit\u00e4n''.

On 1 June 1965, he was promoted to ''[[Flottillenadmiral]]'' (flotilla admiral), a rank which he initially held on probation. That day, he was made chief-of-staff of the NATO command [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches|COMNAVBALTAP]] at [[Kiel]], taking command on 15 June. Six months later, on 15 December, he officially became ''Flottillenadmiral''. His command ended on 31 March 1969. The next day, Kretschmer was transferred to the [[:de:Amt f\u00fcr Milit\u00e4rkunde|''Amt f\u00fcr Milit\u00e4rkunde'']] (Department of Military Studies), retiring on 30 September 1970.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=43}}\n\nIn later years Kretschmer was often interviewed for television and radio programmes about the Second World War; he appeared in the British 1974 documentary series ''[[The World at War]]''. In the mid-1990s he was interviewed for the computer simulation game ''[[Aces of the Deep (video game)|Aces of the Deep]]'', as one of several former U-boat skippers whose input was excerpted specially for the CD-Rom version of the game.\n\n===Death===\nWhile on holiday in [[Bavaria]] in the summer of 1998, Kretschmer died in an accident during a boating expedition on the [[Danube]] to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary, at the age of 86.

For this he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]], among other awards. He earned the nickname \"Silent Otto\" both for his successful use of the \"[[Silent running (submarine)|silent running]]\" capability of U-boats as well as for his reluctance to transmit radio messages during patrols. After the war, he served in the German Federal Navy and retired in 1970 with the rank of ''Flottillenadmiral'' (flotilla admiral).\n\n==Early life and career==\nKretschmer was born in [[Hajduki Nyskie|Heidau]] near [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], then in the [[German Empire]] on 1 May 1912 to Friedrich Wilhelm Otto and Alice new Herbig.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=1}} His father was a teacher at the local ''Volkschule'' ([[primary school]]) where Otto attended from 1918\u20131921. He then moved to a ''Realgymnasium'' ([[secondary school]]).{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=1}} In the aftermath of [[World War I]] the Kretschmer family remained aloof from the political turbulence of the [[Weimar era]]. Kretschmer indulged in sporting pastimes and scientific interests. Kretschmer achieved good results in mathematics and chemistry and passed his ''[[Abitur]]'' (school-leaving certificate) at 17. The report contained the remark, \"Kretschmer demonstrated his extraordinary courage in many instances. He wants to be a naval officer.\"{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=2}} Kretschmer was too young to enlist at 17 and his father sent him to [[England]] to broaden his horizons. He enrolled at [[Exeter University]] (then University College of the South West of England) and studied under Professor Jacob Wilhelm Schopp (b. 1871), a German\u2013born naturalised Briton. He mastered the [[English language]] and came to respect British education, its practical focus complemented his scientific and theoretical\u2013based German background. His time in England shaped his view of them during the war; he was quick to believe in rumours of new British inventions during the war at sea.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=2\u20134}} He returned home upon his mother's death from tetanus in a medical malpractice incident. He did not return to England from his hiatus, but travelled through [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=2\u20134}}\n\n===''Reichsmarine''===\n\nKretschmer entered the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (Weimar Navy) on 1 April 1930 as ''See Offizier Anw\u00e4rter'' (naval officer cadet). Kretschmer formed part of \"Crew 30\" (the incoming class of 1930), 78\u2013strong intake of officer candidates.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=3}} He underwent basic military training in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Stralsund]] (1 April 1930&nbsp;\u2013 30 June 1930).<ref group=Tr>2nd department \u2014II. ''Abteilung''</ref><ref group=Tr>standing ship division \u2014''Schiffsstammdivision''</ref> Kretschmer was then transferred to the [[training ship]] [[Niobe (schooner)|''Niobe'']] (1 July 1930&nbsp;\u2013 9 October 1930), attaining the rank of ''[[Midshipman|Seekadett]]'' (midshipman) on 9 October 1930. Following a 14-month stay onboard the [[German cruiser Emden|cruiser ''Emden'']] (10 October 1930&nbsp;\u2013 4 January 1932), he advanced in rank to ''[[F\u00e4hnrich zur See]]'' (officer cadet) on 1 January 1932.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=41}}{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=5\u20137}} The global cruise on ''Emden'' took Kretschmer to the [[Far East]] through the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Suez canal]]. The ship made stops in [[Ceylon]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Stops were made in [[Guam]], [[South Africa]], [[Angola]] and [[Spain]] on the return journey.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=8}} The ''Emden'' returned to [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 2 December 1931. On 1 January 1932, Kretschmer and his crew mates were promoted to ''[[F\u00e4hnrich zur See]]'' ([[midshipman]]).{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=41}}\n\nFollowing his journey on ''Emden'', Kretschmer attended a naval infantry course for cadets at Stralsund (5 January\u201331 March 1932),<ref group=Tr>infantry course for cadets\u2014''Infanterielehrgang f\u00fcr F\u00e4hnriche''</ref> before starting with the main cadet course at the [[Naval Academy M\u00fcrwik]] on 1 April 1932.<ref group=Tr>main cadet course\u2014''Hauptlehrgang f\u00fcr F\u00e4hnriche''</ref> This course was interrupted by two brief assignments on the [[survey vessel]] [[Meteor (1915)|''Meteor'']] (22\u201325 June 1932 and 10\u201315 October 1932) for navigation training.

This stay was interrupted for an aerial defense training course at Warnem\u00fcnde (5\u201310 March 1934).<ref group=Tr>aerial defense training course for cadets\u2014''Luftschutzlehrgang f\u00fcr F\u00e4hnriche''</ref> On 19 March 1934, his stay on ''Deutschland'' ended and he was transferred to the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}} (20 March \u2013 26 September 1934).{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=41}} Kretschmer was present for gunnery exercises in the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea]]. At [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]] on the 25/26 July 1934 Hitler boarded the ship to observe the exercise.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=8\u20139}} During this assignment, Kretschmer was promoted to ''Oberf\u00e4hnrich zur See'' (Senior Ensign) on 1 April 1934.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=41}} During another torpedo training course at Flensburg-M\u00fcrwik (27 September \u2013 21 December 1934), Kretschmer received his commission as ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' on 1 October 1934.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|pp=41\u201342}} On 22 December 1934, Kretschmer was again on ''K\u00f6ln'' serving as the ship's second torpedo officer.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=42}}\n\n===''Kriegsmarine''===\nIn 1933 [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] came to power. The establishment of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (Nazi German Armed Forces) in 1935 divided the major branches of the armed forces. The ''Reichsmarine'' was renamed the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', a Nazi creation. The [[OKM]] was established as the supreme command of the navy responsible for all facets of [[naval warfare]]. The renaming of the navy was a symbolic gesture, to erase the unpleasant memories of the 1920s and symbolise a new era.{{sfn|Thomas|1990|p=110}} According to one historian, Kretschmer was a patriot and loyal to the government, but later \"eschewed Nazi efforts to glorify his success through [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]].\"{{sfn|Zabecki|1999|p=380}}\n\nDuring Kretschmer's stay on ''K\u00f6ln'', he attended an [[aircraft catapult]] course at [[Travem\u00fcnde]].<ref group=Tr>aircraft catapult course \u2014''Katapultlehrgang''</ref> On 26 September 1935, he was transferred to the 1st department of the standing ship division of the North Sea in Wilhelmshaven where he served as a company officer until 25 January 1936.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=42}} Kretschmer joined the U-boat service in January 1936. After the completion of his submariner training he was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' (sub-lieutenant){{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=9}} on 1 June 1936.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=42}}  Kretschmer's first operational experience on a submarine was as a lieutenant on the {{GS|U-35|1936|2}} in 1937 as first watch officer under the command of [[Klaus Ewerth]] and then [[Hans-Rudolf R\u00f6sing]]. R\u00f6sing brought his own watch officer, and Kretschmer was demoted to second watch officer. While discharging his responsibilities for the operational readiness of the deck gun, R\u00f6sing dived leaving Kretschmer stranded in the freezing water. He clung to the periscope in the hope of being seen through the optics. Kretschmer was soon missed and the boat surfaced to find him before he succumbed to the cold.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nHe was given interim command of ''U-35'' in August 1937, and this appointment coincided with [[German involvement in the Spanish Civil War|Germany's involvement]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The boat was ordered to patrol the [[Bay of Biscay]] off the Spanish-French border. The crew were permitted ashore at the resort town of [[San Sebastian]]. R\u00f6sing's successor, Hermann Michahelles was killed in a car accident and Kretschmer assumed command for two weeks.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=14\u201315}} ''U-35'' returned to Germany after an uneventful patrol during which no ships were sunk. On 1 October 1937, Kretschmer took command of {{GS|U-23|1936|2}}.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=14}} Through the remaining [[Interwar period]], Kretschmer developed his own approach to combat. He dispensed with the standard practice of firing salvos, instead he practiced a \"one torpedo one ship\" policy as a means to achieving utmost efficiency with munitions. Kretschmer favoured surfaced attacks as opposed to the recommended submerged engagement.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=15\u201319}} Kretschmer was promoted to ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' ([[captain lieutenant]]) on 1 June 1939.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=42}}\n\n==World War II==\n===''U-23'': Patrols 1\u20138===\nThe [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939 began the war in Europe. [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]],  [[Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote]] (BdU), ordered attacks on Allied shipping at sea, beginning the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. The short range of the [[Type II submarine]] allowed for operations in the North Sea, but no further.\n\n[[File:U-9 IWM HU 1012.jpg|thumb|left|A [[German Type II submarine#Type IIB|Type IIB]] U-boat similar to ''U-23'']]\nKretschmer and ''U-23'' had departed from Wilhelmshaven on 25 August, one week before the start of World War II. His first patrol, with ''Oberleutnant zur See'' [[Adalbert Schnee]] as first watch officer, took ''U-23'' into the [[North Sea]] and along the coast of the Netherlands. The boat returned to Wilhelmshaven on 4 September.{{sfn|Busch|R\u00f6ll|2003|p=43}} Further patrols took ''U-23'' around the [[Coastline of the United Kingdom|British coast]].

On 4 October 1939 he sank the coastal ship [[List of shipwrecks in October 1939#4 October|''Glen Farg'']] ({{GRT|876|link=off}}). The small freighter was carrying pulp and [[Ferrochrome]]. Kretschmer waited for the crew to take to the lifeboats before destroying the ship with a torpedo.{{sfn|Haarr|2010|p=107}} He returned to Kiel, rather than Wilhelmshaven, on 16 October.

Kretschmer then met Hitler at the [[Reich Chancellery]] and he repeated his opinions on the war situation. Hitler invited Kretschmer to sit in on a lunch meeting with Hitler and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s ambassador to the Third Reich.

It took nine torpedoes and one dud to sink them; the latter was sunk after it stopped to pick up survivors from the former.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=72}} Kretschmer was forced to engage ''Patroclus'' with the deck gun when it appeared to resist the torpedo damage but retreated when the ship fired back. A [[Short Sunderland]] appeared briefly, and Kretschmer was forced to accomplish the destruction of the ship with torpedoes, submerged.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=72}} On 7 December 1940, Kretschmer sank the Dutch freighter ''[[List of shipwrecks in December 1940#7 December|Farmsum]]''; the last success of the year.

For 13 days Kretschmer sailed without success. ''U-99'' tried in vain to assist Prien in ''U-47'', against OB&nbsp;290. Prien achieved several sinkings, Kretschmer did not; the pair was chased off by destroyers. Prien's reports were picked up by the Luftwaffe which sent [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]]s from I. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' of [[Kampfgeschwader 40|''Kampfgeschwader'' 40]] (KG&nbsp;40\u201440th Bomber Wing) to attack the convoy. The air crews sank eight and damaged several more. Kretschmer continued to search for stragglers and found ''SS Holmlea''. He fired a single torpedo that missed before he lost the ship in thick mist. Prien sank the ship the following day.

Prien, Kretschmer along with {{GS|U-70|1940|2}} (Matz) and {{GS|UA|1939|2}} attacked the convoy. The ships were protected by an escort group of two [[destroyer]]s, {{HMS|Wolverine|D78|2}} and {{HMS|Verity|D63|2}}, and two [[corvette]]s, {{HMS|Arbutus|K86|2}} and {{HMS|Camellia|K31|2}}.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|2005|p=62}} As with the group that would eventually sink Kretschmer ten days later, they were experienced and competent.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=52}} Kretschmer attempted a surface night attack using his favourite tactic.{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=187\u2013190}} On 7 March Kretschmer sank two ships from the convoy including the {{GRT|20,638|link=off}} ''[[list of shipwrecks in March 1941#7 March|Terje Viken]]''.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=45}} Four ships were sunk, but two U-boats were sunk, one of them ''U-47''.

Kretschmer sank all but one of the ships lost by the convoy.{{sfn|Rohwer|1999|p=46}} During a counterattack by the escorts ''U-99'' was disabled after repeated [[depth charge]] attacks by the destroyers {{HMS|Walker|D27|2}} and {{HMS|Vanoc|H33|2}}.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=77}} ''U-99'' was driven down to 700 feet\u2014beyond the recognised [[crush depth]]\u2014 before control was regained and the ballast tanks blown.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} Kretschmer surfaced and, under fire from the British vessels, scuttled his boat. Three of his men were lost, but Kretschmer and the remainder of ''U-99''{{'}}s crew were captured. That same day the British escorts scored another success against the ''Kriegsmarine'' when the noted U-Boat skipper, [[Joachim Schepke]], was killed aboard {{GS|U-100|1940|2}}, having been depth charged, rammed and sunk by ''Vanoc''.{{sfn|Morgan|Taylor|2011|p=77}}\n\nKretschmer's usual standards of conduct were evident during the sinking of his boat. One signalman sent a message to the escorts \"we are sinking\" and the firing stopped.{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} He then sent a message to BdU, \"Two destroyers\u2014depth charges\u201450,000 tons\u2014Kretschmer.\"{{sfn|Milner|2011|p=53}} Kretschmer signalled ''Walker'' asking for rescue for his men, taking care to ensure as many left the submarine as possible, and assisted some of his crew towards the rescue nets hung from the British destroyer. Kretschmer's strength was evidently failing in the cold ocean; his own rescue was at the hands of a British sailor who climbed down the nets and plucked him from the water.{{sfn|Padfield|1995|p=115}}\n\n===Prisoner of war===\nKretschmer and his crew were landed in [[Liverpool]]. They were sent to [[Lime Street Station]] to be transported to London for interrogation. Kretschmer was taken separately but his crew had to negotiate the streets of Liverpool and were subjected to missiles thrown by angry civilians; the city [[Liverpool Blitz|had been heavily bombed]] and was closely linked with the Atlantic war. He was transported to the [[London Cage]], a facility for [[MI19]] to hold valuable enemy prisoners. The building was located at number 8 [[Kensington Palace Gardens]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|pp=230\u2013232}} [[Winston Churchill]] disclosed the capture of Kretschmer to the [[House of Commons]] on 21 March.

The report, filed in the archives, was named [http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"U 99\" Interrogation of Survivors April, 1941\"]. The British reported noted of Kretschmer, \"His political views were less extremely Nazi than had been assumed.\u00a0 On seeing the craters of a stick of bombs near [[Buckingham Palace]] he was genuinely shocked that an attempt had so obviously been made by his countrymen to bomb the Palace. He spoke English quite well, though he lacked practice.\u00a0 His whole demeanour was calm and quiet, and he seemed anxious to be friendly; he was also less suspicious of British Officers than was his First Lieutenant.\u00a0Kretschmer stated that he was unmarried.\"<ref>[http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"Interrogation of U-99 survivors\"]</ref>\n\nOf his personality and view of the war it stated, \"He gave the impression of being a quiet, deliberate man, and looked more like a student than a U-Boat Captain.\u00a0He prided himself on being able to take advantage of whatever the passing moment offered and made no elaborate plans for attacking convoys. He admitted that he had become weary of the war some time ago, and latterly had got no satisfaction from sinking ship after ship.\n\"<ref>[http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-99A/U-99INT.htm \"Interrogation of U-99 survivors\"]</ref>\n\nFollowing his capture, Kretschmer spent almost seven years as a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) in the hands of the British at No1 POW camp [[Grizedale Hall]]  in [[Cumbria]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=202}} In March 1942, the prisoners were transported to Bowmanville Camp near [[Lake Ontario]] in [[Canada]].{{sfn|Paterson|2018|p=230}} During his captivity, Kretschmer was promoted in rank to ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (corvette captain) on 19 March 1941, effective as of 1 March 1941, and to ''[[Fregattenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (frigate captain) on 1 September 1944. In addition, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern}}) on 26 December 1941.
