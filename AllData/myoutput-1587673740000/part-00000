{"title_page": "Coaching tree", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=January 2011}}\nA '''coaching tree''' is similar to a [[family tree]] except that it shows the relationships of [[Coach (sport)|coaches]] instead of family members. There are several ways to define a relationship between two coaches. The most common way to make the distinction is if a coach worked as an assistant on a particular head coach's staff for at least a season then that coach can be counted as being a branch on the head coach's coaching tree. Coaching trees can also show philosophical influence from one head coach to an assistant.\n\nCoaching trees are common in the [[National Football League]] and most coaches in the NFL can trace their lineage back to a certain head coach for whom they previously worked as an assistant.\n\nThe phrase \"coaching tree\" has also grown to refer colloquially to any idea or set of ideas originated by an individual or group. For example, an individual may claim an original idiom or phrase as part of his or her coaching tree if used by another individual.\n\nCoaching trees are becoming more prominent in today's NFL culture. They are often referenced by various media outlets, such as ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html|title=All roads lead to Walsh...sort of|work=ESPN.com|first=Len|last= Pasquarelli}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nIn 1998, half of the active head coaches in the [[National Football League]] could be traced to [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] and [[Tom Landry]].  Of those fifteen coaches, four (plus Walsh and Landry) had coached a [[Super Bowl]] winning team.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Maxwell\n | first = John\n | authorlink = John C.

The Colts later hired [[Frank Reich]]. The only three NFL head coaches who couldn't be connected to either Parcells or Belichick, according to this said article, were the following coaches: [[Andy Reid]] of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Matt Nagy]] of the [[Chicago Bears]], and [[Doug Pederson]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Incidentally, both Pederson and Nagy were once former assistants under Reid before becoming head coaches. Additionally, before Reich became head coach of the Colts, he served as Pederson's offensive coordinator of the Eagles, and helped Philadelphia win [[Super Bowl LII]]. Therefore, Reich is connected to Reid through Pederson.\n\nCoaching tree examples (shown visually below) include Bill Walsh, [[Marty Schottenheimer]], and Bill Parcells.\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Coaching Trees.GIF]]\n\n==Philosophical tree connections==\nCoaching trees can also show a philosophical relationship between a mentor head coach and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Below is a list of current and former head coaches and who they primarily developed their philosophy under:\n\n*[[Norv Turner]]: Most recently, Turner worked as an offensive coordinator under [[Mike Nolan]] in [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]]. However, Nolan previously worked under Turner when he was the head coach with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] as a defensive coordinator 1997-1999. Also, before getting his first head coaching job with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in 1994, Turner worked under both [[John Robinson (football coach)|John Robinson]] in [[Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]].<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7475052_ITM Turner article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Wade Phillips]]: Coached under [[Marty Schottenheimer]], but primarily learned his philosophy from his father, [[Bum Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5076766.html|title=Cowboys' Phillips makes name for himself in coaching|first=Dale|last= Robertson|date= August 23, 2007|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Jon Gruden]]: Worked under [[Mike Holmgren]] in [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-07-2975455381_x.htm|title=Seahawks' Holmgren has what former protege Gruden wants with Bucs|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 7, 2007|first=Gregg|last= Bell|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Tony Dungy]]: Dungy is listed above as part of the Schottenheimer coaching tree and was a Defensive Coordinator under Dennis Green. However, Dungy attributes most of his coaching style from tutelage under [[Chuck Noll]]. Noll learned much of his own philosophy from [[Paul Brown]]. Noll coached Dungy as a player and also gave him his first NFL position as the defensive backs coach of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Dungy later became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers.<ref>[http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/07/28/dungy-drops-chuck-nolls-name-again/ Dungy article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Todd Haley]]: Coached under [[Bill Parcells]] and learned his philosophy from him for many years before joining [[Ken Whisenhunt]] in Arizona, in 2007.\n*[[Steve Spagnuolo]]: While Spagnuolo is credited under [[Tom Coughlin]] and Bill Parcells tree, he studied and learned much of his style and system during his tenure in [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]] under [[Jim Johnson (American football)|Jim Johnson]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Spagnuolo took Johnson's style of play to [[New York Giants|New York]] where he gained national attention for his scheming and personnel packages that helped shut down [[New England Patriots|New England]] in the [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]], one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. He then took that defense to [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]].\n*[[Jack Del Rio]]: Del Rio worked under [[Marvin Lewis]] on the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]' defensive staff. However, Del R\u00edo got his coaching start from [[Mike Ditka]] in [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]], and then worked as defensive coordinator under [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] in [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]] before being hired by [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] in [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2003]].\n\nAdditionally, many college football coaches worked as assistants for head coaches on the tree. For instance, [[Bill Belichick]] can claim [[Kirk Ferentz]], [[Nick Saban]], and [[Charlie Weis]] as descendants of his tree, though they are not included in the graphic above.\n*Bum Phillips coached under Gillman with the Oilers, and was chosen by Gillman to succeed him upon Gillman's stepping down from the head coaching job of the Houston Oilers.\n\n==The Bill Belichick Tree==\n\nThe Belichick coaching tree is far reaching<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22235093/connecting-all-2018-nfl-head-coaches-bill-parcells-bill-belichick|title=The Bill & Bill League: How nearly every coach traces to two men|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/bill-belichicks-coaching-tree-14f9b4e309524d4d|title=Bill Belichick's Coaching Tree|website=www.stadiumtalk.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/extra-points/2015/01/03/bill_belichicks_coaching_tree_has_branches_both_fu|title=Bill Belichick\u2019s Coaching Tree Has Branches Both Lush and Barren {{!}} Boston.com|website=www.boston.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> due to the 17 assistant under him who have went on to become head coaches in the NFL and college and sprouted their own trees leading to  over 100 total offshoots which include 13 active NFL head coaches.\n* [[Bill Belichick]]\n**[[Nick Saban]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fanbuzz.com/college-football/sec/alabama/nick-saban-coaching-tree/|title=Nick Saban\u2019s Coaching Tree May Be His Greatest Achievement|last=Pinak|first=Patrick|date=2019-12-26|website=FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL {{!}} NCAA {{!}} NBA {{!}}  WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (1995\u20131999), [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] (2000\u20132004),  [[Miami Dolphins]] (2005\u20132006),[[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] (2007\u2013present)\n***[[Dean Pees]], [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] (1998\u20132003)\n*** [[Bobby Williams]], [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2000\u20132002)\n**** [[Don Treadwell]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2011\u20132013)\n**** [[Ben McAdoo]], [[New York Giants]] (2016\u20132017)\n*** [[Mark Dantonio]], [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] (2004\u20132006), [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2007\u20132020) \n****[[Dan Enos]], [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan]] (2010\u20132014)\n**** [[Pat Narduzzi]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] (2015\u2013present)\n***** [[Josh Conklin]], [[Wofford Terriers football|Wofford]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Brad Salem]], [[Augustana College (Illinois)]] (2005\u20132009)\n*** [[Scott Linehan]], [[St. Louis Rams]] (2006\u20132008) \n*** [[Derek Dooley (American football)|Derek Dooley]], [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] (2007\u20132009), [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] (2010\u20132012)\n**** [[Tommy Spangler]], [[Presbyterian Blue Hose football|Presbyterian]] (2017\u2013present)\n****[[Justin Wilcox (American football)|Justin Wilcox]], [[California Golden Bears football|California]] (2017\u2013present) \n***** [[Beau Baldwin]], [[Cal Poly Mustangs football|Cal Poly]] (2020\u2013present)\n**** [[Frank Scelfo]], [[Southeastern Louisiana Lions football|Southeastern Louisiana]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Sam Pittman]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] (2020-present)\n*** [[Josh McDaniels]], [[Denver Broncos]] (2009\u20132010) (first served under Saban)\n*** [[Michael Haywood|Mike Haywood]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2009\u20132010), [[Texas Southern Tigers football|Texas Southern]] (2016\u20132018)\n*** [[Jimbo Fisher]], [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (2010\u20132017), [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Mark Stoops]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] (2013\u2013present)\n***** [[Neal Brown]], [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] (2015\u20132018); [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] (2019\u2013present)\n***** [[Dean Hood]], [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]] (2019-present)\n**** [[Randy Sanders]], [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers football|East Tennessee State]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Jason Garrett]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] (2011\u20132019)\n*** [[Curt Cignetti]], [[IUP Crimson Hawks football|IUP]] (2011\u20132016), [[Elon Phoenix football|Elon]] (2017\u20132018), [[James Madison Dukes football|James Madison]] (2019\u2013present)\n*** [[Pat Shurmur]], [[Cleveland Browns]] (2011\u20132012), [[New York Giants]] (2018\u20132019)\n**** [[Mark Whipple]], [[UMass Minutemen football|UMass]] (2014\u20132018)\n*** [[Will Muschamp]], [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] (2011\u20132014), [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] (2016\u2013present) \n**** [[D.

The most common way to make the distinction is if a coach worked as an assistant on a particular head coach's staff for at least a season then that coach can be counted as being a branch on the head coach's coaching tree. Coaching trees can also show philosophical influence from one head coach to an assistant.\n\nCoaching trees are common in the [[National Football League]] and most coaches in the NFL can trace their lineage back to a certain head coach for whom they previously worked as an assistant.\n\nThe phrase \"coaching tree\" has also grown to refer colloquially to any idea or set of ideas originated by an individual or group. For example, an individual may claim an original idiom or phrase as part of his or her coaching tree if used by another individual.\n\nCoaching trees are becoming more prominent in today's NFL culture. They are often referenced by various media outlets, such as ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html|title=All roads lead to Walsh...sort of|work=ESPN.com|first=Len|last= Pasquarelli}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nIn 1998, half of the active head coaches in the [[National Football League]] could be traced to [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] and [[Tom Landry]].  Of those fifteen coaches, four (plus Walsh and Landry) had coached a [[Super Bowl]] winning team.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Maxwell\n | first = John\n | authorlink = John C.

The Colts later hired [[Frank Reich]]. The only three NFL head coaches who couldn't be connected to either Parcells or Belichick, according to this said article, were the following coaches: [[Andy Reid]] of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Matt Nagy]] of the [[Chicago Bears]], and [[Doug Pederson]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Incidentally, both Pederson and Nagy were once former assistants under Reid before becoming head coaches. Additionally, before Reich became head coach of the Colts, he served as Pederson's offensive coordinator of the Eagles, and helped Philadelphia win [[Super Bowl LII]]. Therefore, Reich is connected to Reid through Pederson.\n\nCoaching tree examples (shown visually below) include Bill Walsh, [[Marty Schottenheimer]], and Bill Parcells.\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Coaching Trees.GIF]]\n\n==Philosophical tree connections==\nCoaching trees can also show a philosophical relationship between a mentor head coach and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Below is a list of current and former head coaches and who they primarily developed their philosophy under:\n\n*[[Norv Turner]]: Most recently, Turner worked as an offensive coordinator under [[Mike Nolan]] in [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]]. However, Nolan previously worked under Turner when he was the head coach with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] as a defensive coordinator 1997-1999. Also, before getting his first head coaching job with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in 1994, Turner worked under both [[John Robinson (football coach)|John Robinson]] in [[Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]].<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7475052_ITM Turner article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Wade Phillips]]: Coached under [[Marty Schottenheimer]], but primarily learned his philosophy from his father, [[Bum Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5076766.html|title=Cowboys' Phillips makes name for himself in coaching|first=Dale|last= Robertson|date= August 23, 2007|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Jon Gruden]]: Worked under [[Mike Holmgren]] in [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-07-2975455381_x.htm|title=Seahawks' Holmgren has what former protege Gruden wants with Bucs|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 7, 2007|first=Gregg|last= Bell|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Tony Dungy]]: Dungy is listed above as part of the Schottenheimer coaching tree and was a Defensive Coordinator under Dennis Green. However, Dungy attributes most of his coaching style from tutelage under [[Chuck Noll]]. Noll learned much of his own philosophy from [[Paul Brown]]. Noll coached Dungy as a player and also gave him his first NFL position as the defensive backs coach of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Dungy later became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers.<ref>[http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/07/28/dungy-drops-chuck-nolls-name-again/ Dungy article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Todd Haley]]: Coached under [[Bill Parcells]] and learned his philosophy from him for many years before joining [[Ken Whisenhunt]] in Arizona, in 2007.\n*[[Steve Spagnuolo]]: While Spagnuolo is credited under [[Tom Coughlin]] and Bill Parcells tree, he studied and learned much of his style and system during his tenure in [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]] under [[Jim Johnson (American football)|Jim Johnson]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Spagnuolo took Johnson's style of play to [[New York Giants|New York]] where he gained national attention for his scheming and personnel packages that helped shut down [[New England Patriots|New England]] in the [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]], one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. He then took that defense to [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]].\n*[[Jack Del Rio]]: Del Rio worked under [[Marvin Lewis]] on the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]' defensive staff. However, Del R\u00edo got his coaching start from [[Mike Ditka]] in [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]], and then worked as defensive coordinator under [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] in [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]] before being hired by [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] in [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2003]].\n\nAdditionally, many college football coaches worked as assistants for head coaches on the tree. For instance, [[Bill Belichick]] can claim [[Kirk Ferentz]], [[Nick Saban]], and [[Charlie Weis]] as descendants of his tree, though they are not included in the graphic above.\n*Bum Phillips coached under Gillman with the Oilers, and was chosen by Gillman to succeed him upon Gillman's stepping down from the head coaching job of the Houston Oilers.\n\n==The Bill Belichick Tree==\n\nThe Belichick coaching tree is far reaching<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22235093/connecting-all-2018-nfl-head-coaches-bill-parcells-bill-belichick|title=The Bill & Bill League: How nearly every coach traces to two men|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/bill-belichicks-coaching-tree-14f9b4e309524d4d|title=Bill Belichick's Coaching Tree|website=www.stadiumtalk.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/extra-points/2015/01/03/bill_belichicks_coaching_tree_has_branches_both_fu|title=Bill Belichick\u2019s Coaching Tree Has Branches Both Lush and Barren {{!}} Boston.com|website=www.boston.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> due to the 17 assistant under him who have went on to become head coaches in the NFL and college and sprouted their own trees leading to  over 100 total offshoots which include 13 active NFL head coaches.\n* [[Bill Belichick]]\n**[[Nick Saban]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fanbuzz.com/college-football/sec/alabama/nick-saban-coaching-tree/|title=Nick Saban\u2019s Coaching Tree May Be His Greatest Achievement|last=Pinak|first=Patrick|date=2019-12-26|website=FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL {{!}} NCAA {{!}} NBA {{!}}  WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (1995\u20131999), [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] (2000\u20132004),  [[Miami Dolphins]] (2005\u20132006),[[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] (2007\u2013present)\n***[[Dean Pees]], [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] (1998\u20132003)\n*** [[Bobby Williams]], [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2000\u20132002)\n**** [[Don Treadwell]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2011\u20132013)\n**** [[Ben McAdoo]], [[New York Giants]] (2016\u20132017)\n*** [[Mark Dantonio]], [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] (2004\u20132006), [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2007\u20132020) \n****[[Dan Enos]], [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan]] (2010\u20132014)\n**** [[Pat Narduzzi]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] (2015\u2013present)\n***** [[Josh Conklin]], [[Wofford Terriers football|Wofford]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Brad Salem]], [[Augustana College (Illinois)]] (2005\u20132009)\n*** [[Scott Linehan]], [[St. Louis Rams]] (2006\u20132008) \n*** [[Derek Dooley (American football)|Derek Dooley]], [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] (2007\u20132009), [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] (2010\u20132012)\n**** [[Tommy Spangler]], [[Presbyterian Blue Hose football|Presbyterian]] (2017\u2013present)\n****[[Justin Wilcox (American football)|Justin Wilcox]], [[California Golden Bears football|California]] (2017\u2013present) \n***** [[Beau Baldwin]], [[Cal Poly Mustangs football|Cal Poly]] (2020\u2013present)\n**** [[Frank Scelfo]], [[Southeastern Louisiana Lions football|Southeastern Louisiana]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Sam Pittman]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] (2020-present)\n*** [[Josh McDaniels]], [[Denver Broncos]] (2009\u20132010) (first served under Saban)\n*** [[Michael Haywood|Mike Haywood]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2009\u20132010), [[Texas Southern Tigers football|Texas Southern]] (2016\u20132018)\n*** [[Jimbo Fisher]], [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (2010\u20132017), [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Mark Stoops]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] (2013\u2013present)\n***** [[Neal Brown]], [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] (2015\u20132018); [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] (2019\u2013present)\n***** [[Dean Hood]], [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]] (2019-present)\n**** [[Randy Sanders]], [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers football|East Tennessee State]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Jason Garrett]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] (2011\u20132019)\n*** [[Curt Cignetti]], [[IUP Crimson Hawks football|IUP]] (2011\u20132016), [[Elon Phoenix football|Elon]] (2017\u20132018), [[James Madison Dukes football|James Madison]] (2019\u2013present)\n*** [[Pat Shurmur]], [[Cleveland Browns]] (2011\u20132012), [[New York Giants]] (2018\u20132019)\n**** [[Mark Whipple]], [[UMass Minutemen football|UMass]] (2014\u20132018)\n*** [[Will Muschamp]], [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] (2011\u20132014), [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] (2016\u2013present) \n**** [[D.
