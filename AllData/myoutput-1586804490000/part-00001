Since then the two countries have faced each other in four major wars\u2014the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]], the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912 to 1913, the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914 to 1918) and finally the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]], which were followed by the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]] and a period of friendly relations in the 1930s and 1940s. Both countries entered [[NATO]] in 1952. Relations deteriorated again in the 1950s due to the [[Cyprus issue]], the [[1955 Istanbul pogrom]] and the expulsion of the Istanbul Greeks in the 1960s, the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, and subsequent military confrontations over the [[Aegean dispute]]. A period of relative normalization began after 1999 with the so-called \"[[Greek\u2013Turkish earthquake diplomacy|earthquake diplomacy]]\", which notably led to a change in the previously firmly negative stance of the Greek government on the issue of the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]].\n\n==Diplomatic missions==\n*Turkey has an embassy in [[Athens]] and consulates general in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Komotini]] and [[Rhodes]].\n*Greece has an embassy in [[Ankara]] and consulates general in [[Istanbul]], [[\u0130zmir]] and [[Edirne]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Byzantine against Seljuq and Ottoman===\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Ottoman Wars|Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars}}\n[[File:Byzantium vs Seljuk c 1071 cropped.png|thumb|[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine territory]] (purple), Byzantine campaigns (red) and [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] campaigns (green).]]\nIn 1048 conflicts between [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] (Greeks were dominant nation of the Byzantine Empire and the Empire was Hellenized) started. Many [[Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars|wars and battles]] were fought between the Byzantine and the Seljuq armies. Also, in 1300 conflicts between [[Ottomans]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] started too.\n\nIn 1453, Ottomans [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered Constantinople]], the capital city of the Byzantine Empire. In 1460 they conquered the [[Despotate of the Morea]], in 1461 the [[Empire of Trebizond]], in 1475 the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and by 1500 most of the plains and islands were in Ottoman hands. Holdouts included [[Rhodes]], conquered in 1522, [[Cyprus]] in 1571, [[Crete]], retained by the Venetians until 1669, and the [[Ionian islands]] which remained primarily under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]].\n\n===Ottoman era until 1820===\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)]] Greece provided aid to Ottoman rivals. [[Dionysius the Philosopher]] additionally organised several uprisings. In addition, the [[Lambros Katsonis]] fleet began harassing the Ottoman fleet in the Aegean Sea.\n\nIn 1770, the Ottoman army [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)|invaded the Mani]].\n\nIn the [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1803)|1803]], [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1807)|1807]] and [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1815)|1815]] the Ottoman army invaded Mani. Also during this period, in 1803 there was a [[Souliote War (1803)|final fight]] between the [[Souliotes]] and the [[Pashalik of Yanina|local Ottoman]] ruler, [[Ali Pasha of Yanina|Ali Pasha]], which ended the many years of conflicts between them.\n\n===Ottoman era and the Greek state until 1913===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Balkan Wars|}}\n\n[[File:The Ottoman ambassador and his page at a ball at the royal residence in Athens, 1838.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first Ottoman ambassador to the Greek Kingdom, the [[Phanariote]] [[Konstantinos Mousouros]], at a ball in the royal palace in Athens]]\n\nIn March 1821, the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] began. The Greeks formally declared their independence in January 1822, and after the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827, the establishment of a Greek state was recognized in the [[London Protocol (1828)|London Protocol]] of 1828. The first borders of the Greek state consisted of the Greek mainland south of a line from [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to [[Volos]] plus [[Euboea]] and the [[Cyclades]] islands in the Aegean Sea. The rest of the Greek-speaking lands, including [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and the rest of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands, [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], remained under Ottoman rule. Over one million Greeks also lived in what is now [[Turkey]], mainly in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region of [[Asia Minor]], especially around [[Smyrna]], in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region on the [[Black Sea]] coast, in the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], in [[Cappadocia]], in [[Istanbul]], in [[Imbros]] and in [[Tenedos]].\n\nGreek politicians of the 19th century were determined to include all these territories within a greatly enlarged single Greek state, based on the [[Byzantine]] model and with [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) as its capital. This policy was called the Great Idea (''[[Megali Idea]]''). Constantinople had been the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern half of the Roman Empire]] until its fall to the Turks in 1453. The Ottomans naturally opposed these plans for a larger Greek state. The Empire was considered by the European powers as 'the [[sick man of Europe]]', but since these powers were irreconcilably divided over the fate of the Ottoman lands, the conflicts both reduced its territorial hold but also kept delaying its collapse.\n\nDuring the [[Crimean War]] (1854 to 1856), [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] restrained Greece from attacking the Ottomans by occupying [[Piraeus]]. They were again prevented from taking military action during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877, in which the Greeks were keen to join in with the objective of territorial expansion, but Greece was unable to take any effective part in the war. Nevertheless, after the [[Congress of Berlin]], in 1881 Greece was given most of [[Thessaly]] and part of Epirus. Also, in 1854-1896, there were revolts in the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population in Thessaly, Macedonia, [[Epirus Revolt of 1854|Epirus]].\n\nIn 1858-1896 there were many revolts in Crete, Thessaly [[1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus Revolt of 1878|Epirus]] against the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population.\n\n[[File:AsiaMinor1910.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Asia Minor depicting the [[Ottoman Greeks]] (blue) in 1910]]\nIn 1897, a new revolt in [[Crete]] led to the first [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]]. An unprepared Greek army was unable to dislodge the Ottoman troops from their fortifications along the northern border, and with the resulting Ottoman counter-attack, the war resulted in minor territorial losses for Greece.\n\nThe [[Young Turks]], who seized power in the Ottoman Empire in 1908, were Turkish nationalists whose objective was to create a strong, centrally governed state. The Christian minorities of the Empire, including Greeks, saw their position in the Empire deteriorate.\n\nThe [[First Balkan War]] of 1912\u20131913 was a direct consequence of the mounting tension, as a result of which Greece seized Crete, the islands, the rest of Thessaly and Epirus, and coastal Macedonia from the Ottomans, in alliance with [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Crete was once again the flashpoint for tension between the two nations.\n\n===The First World War and after (1914-1927)===\n{{Main|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)}}\n\nIn 1913 an organized persecution of the Christian population of the Ottoman Empire, including the [[Greek genocide|Greeks]], was started. Greece entered the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1917 with the intention of seizing [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and [[Smyrna]] ([[\u0130zmir]]) from the Ottomans, with the encouragement of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]], who also promised the Greeks [[Cyprus]] at a certain stage. The ongoing [[Greek genocide|genocide of Pontic Greeks]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} in the Ottoman Empire also played a factor in this decision{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Although there was little direct fighting between Greeks and Turks{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, when the Ottoman Empire collapsed in 1918 the Greeks were quick to claim the lands the Allies had promised them. The 1920 [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] gave Greece eastern [[Thrace]] and an area of about 17,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 in western [[Anatolia]] around Smyrna. This Treaty was signed by the Ottoman government but never went into force, not having been ratified by Parliament.\n\n[[Occupation of Smyrna|Greece occupied Smyrna/\u0130zmir]] on 15 May 1919, while [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] (later [[Atat\u00fcrk]]), who was to become the leader of the Turkish opposition to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], landed in [[Samsun]] on May 19, 1919, an action that is regarded as the beginning of the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. He united the protesting voices in Anatolia and set in motion a nationalist movement to repel the armies that had occupied Turkey (including Italy, France and Britain) and establish new borders for a sovereign Turkish nation. Having created a separate government in [[Ankara]], Kemal's government did not recognise the abortive Treaty of S\u00e8vres and fought to have it revoked. The Greek advances into Anatolia were eventually checked and the Greek army was forced into retreat.\n\n\n[[File:Asia Minor massacres.jpg|thumb|Overcrowded boats with refugees fleeing the [[Great fire of Smyrna]]. The photo was taken from the launch boat of a US warship.]]\nThe Turkish army entered Smyrna/\u0130zmir on 9 September 1922, effectively ending the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] in the field. The Greek army and administration had already left by sea. The war was put to an end by the [[Armistice of Mudanya]], and the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] replaced previous treaties to constitute modern [[Turkey]].\n\nThe [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] also provided for a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] that had begun before the final signature of the treaty in July 1923. About one and a half million Greeks had to leave Turkey for Greece and about half a million Turks had to leave Greece for Turkey (note that the population exchange was on religious grounds, thus the exchange was officially that of [[Christians]] for [[Muslims]]). The exceptions to the population exchange were Istanbul (Constantinople) and the islands of [[G\u00f6k\u00e7eada]] ([[Imbros]]) and [[Bozcaada]] ([[Tenedos]]), where the Greek minority (including the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]) was allowed to stay, and [[Western Thrace]], whose Muslim minority was also allowed to stay.\n\nDue to the defeat of the Greek army and the events following which terminated 3,000 years of Greek presence in Anatolia, Greece refers to it as the Asia Minor Catastrophe/Disaster. The alleged atrocities committed by the Greek army during the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia (1919\u20131922) left a lasting impression on the Turkish mind. Greek accusations, on the other hand, were focused on the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], especially in view of the account provided by [[George Horton]], the U.S. Consul General in the city from 1919 to 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/Horton/HortonBook.htm|title=THE BLIGHT OF ASIA|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> Horton's account remains as controversial as the fire itself.<ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/byz/2006/00000030/00000001/art00005] In an article published in [http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110742/http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 |date=2007-09-29 }} (\"George Horton: The literary diplomat)\", [[Brian Coleman]] describes his subject matter as follows: \"George Horton was a man of letters and United States Consul in Greece and Turkey at a time of social and political change.

His account, however, goes beyond the blame and events to a demonization of Muslims, in general, and of Turks, in particular. In several of his novels, written more than two decades before the events of September 1922, he had already identified the Turk as the stock-in-trade [[villain]] of Western civilization. In his account of Smyrna, he writes not as a historian, but as a publicist.\"</ref><ref>[http://www.kapatel.gr/matrix/science/eemet/patakis.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218070032/http://www.kapatel.gr/matrix/science/eemet/patakis.htm |date=2005-12-18 }} Proclamation issued by the [[New York State]] Governor [[George E.

Tenedos population was overwhelmingly Greek, and Imbros population was entirely Greek. However, after the legislation of \"Civil Law\" on 26 June 1927, the rights accorded to the Greek population of Imbros and Tenedos were revoked, in violation of the Lausanne Treaty. Thus, the island was demoted from an administrative district to a sub-district which resulted that the island was to be stripped of its local tribunals. Moreover, the members of the local council were obliged to have adequate knowledge of the Turkish language, which meant that the vast majority of the islanders were excluded. Furthermore, according to this law, the Turkish government retained the right to dissolve this council and in certain circumstances, to introduce police force and other officials who were non-islanders. This law also violated the educational rights of the local community and imposed an educational system similar to that followed by ordinary Turkish schools.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexandris|first=Alexis|title=Imbros and Tenedos:: A Study of Turkish Attitudes Toward Two Ethnic Greek Island Communities Since 1923|year=1980|publisher=Pella Publishing Company|page=21|url=http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/13027/07_1_1980.pdf?sequence=1.}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Corfu incident]] between Italy and Greece, at 1923, elements in Turkey advised [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] to seize the opportunity to invade [[Western Thrace]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96042274 |title=ANOTHER BALKAN WAR THREATENED. |newspaper=[[The Recorder (Port Pirie)|The Recorder]] |location=Port Pirie, SA |date=8 September 1923 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} \"Reports from Turkey show that a section of opinion is already urging Kemal Pasha to seize the opportunity to invade Western Thrace.\"</ref>\n\n===1928-1954: Normalization of the relations===\n[[File:AtaturkAndVenizelos.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The first president of Turkey [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] (center) hosting Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] (at left) in [[Ankara]] October 27, 1930]]\n\nThe post-war leaders of Turkey and Greece, [[Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] and [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] respectively, were determined to establish normal relations between the two states.

This was followed by the [[Balkan Pact]] of 1934, in which Greece and Turkey joined [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]] in a treaty of mutual assistance and settled outstanding issues (Bulgaria refused to join).

Turkish president [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] signed a decision to help the people whose army he had personally fought during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] 19 years earlier. Foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of K\u0131z\u0131lay ([[Turkish Red Crescent]])and sent to the port of \u0130stanbul to be shipped to Greece. The aid was shipped on board the vessel ''[[SS Kurtulu\u015f]]'' with big symbols of the [[Red Crescent]] painted on both sides. (''See [[SS Kurtulu\u015f]] for more information.'')\n\nAt the same time, Turkey signed a \"[[German\u2013Turkish Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Friendship and cooperation]]\" with Nazi Germany in June 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/assets1.html|title=New Supplement to the State Department Report on Holocaust Assets - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> The following year, 1942, Turkey imposed the [[Varl\u0131k Vergisi]], a special tax, which taxed the non-Muslim minorities of Turkey, including Greek minority. Also, during the WWII there was the incident of [[the Twenty Classes]], this was the conscription of non-Muslims males who were sent in labour battalions.\n\nThe early [[Cold War]] brought closer the international policies of the two countries, in 1950 both fought at the [[Korean War]] at the side of the [[UN]] forces. In 1952, both countries joined [[NATO]]. In 1953 Greece, Turkey and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] formed [[Balkan Pact (1953)|a new Balkan Pact]] for mutual defence against the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Istanbul_Pogrom}} Istanbul Pogrom, Cyprus crisis, Turkish invasion and the collapse of the Greek military junta (1955-1975)===\n{{Further|Istanbul Pogrom|Cyprus dispute|Cypriot intercommunal violence|1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}\n\nA serious matter of conflict in Turkish-Greek relations since the 1950s has been [[Cyprus]]; at the time, it was a British colony with a Greek-Cypriot population share of 82% of the island's total. Some of the Greek Cypriots wanted unity (''enosis'') with Greece and, as early as 1931, there were nationalist riots in [[Nicosia]]. The Greek government was, due to its financial and diplomatic dependence on Britain, forced to disavow any aims for unification with Cyprus.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Cyprus issue flared up again when the Greek Cypriots, under [[Archbishop Makarios]], claimed union with Greece, and the [[EOKA]] group launched a paramilitary movement on the island - mainly against the British, but also inflicting collateral damage to other parties and civilians. Eventually, Greek Prime Minister [[Alexander Papagos]] took the Cyprus issue to the [[United Nations]].\n\nTurkish nationalist sentiment, angered by the discrimination against the Turkish Cypriots, became inflamed at the idea that Cyprus would be ceded to Greece. This led to the Greek community of Istanbul becoming the target in the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] of 1955. In response, Greece withdrew from all co-operation with Turkey, which caused the Balkan Pact to collapse.\n\nIn 1960, a compromise solution to the Cyprus issue was agreed on: Britain granted independence to Cyprus, and a constitution was hammered out. Greek and Turkish troops were stationed on the island to protect their respective communities. Greek Prime Minister [[Constantine Karamanlis]] was the main architect of this plan, which led to an immediate improvement in relations with Turkey, particularly once [[Adnan Menderes]] was removed from power in Turkey.\n\nDuring the period of [[Cyprus crisis of 1963\u201364|intercommunal strife in 1963 and 1964]], Greek and Turkish Cypriots were displaced and many were massacred on both sides.\n\nOn 30 December 1964, Makarios declared his proposal for a constitutional amendment that included 13 articles. Turkey, however, restated that she was against this and threatened war if Cyprus tried to achieve unity with Greece. In August, Turkish aircraft bombed Greek troops that surrounded a Turkish village (Erenkoy) and war seemed imminent. Once again, the Greek minority in Turkey suffered from the crisis, causing many Greeks to flee the country, and there were even threats to expel the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]. Eventually, intervention by the [[United Nations]] led to another compromise solution.\n\nIn 1964 Turkish prime minister [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] renounced the 1930 Greek-Turkish Treaty of friendship and took actions against the Greek minority.<ref name=The_New_York_Times_Aug_9_1964/><ref>{{cite book|last1= Roudometof |first1=Victor |last2=Agadjanian |first2=Alexander |last3=Pankhurst|first3=Jerry |title=Eastern Orthodoxy in a Global Age: Tradition Faces the 21st Century  |url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=mQRtAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |year=2006 |publisher= AltaMira Press| isbn=978-0759105379|pages=273}}</ref> Turkey enforced strictly a long\u2010overlooked law barring Greek nationals from 30 professions and occupations, for example Greeks could not be doctors, nurses, architects, shoemakers, tailors, plumbers, cabaret singers, ironsmiths, cooks, tourist guides, etc.<ref name=The_New_York_Times_Aug_9_1964>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/09/archives/turks-expelling-istanbul-greeks-communitys-plight-worsens-during.html|title=TURKS EXPELLING ISTANBUL GREEKS; Community's Plight Worsens During Cyprus Crisis|date=August 9, 1964|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Many Greek have been ordered to give up their jobs after this law.<ref name=The_New_York_Times_Apr_24_1964>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/greeks-of-istanbul-unhappy-with-both-ankara-and-athens.html|title=Greeks of Istanbul Unhappy With Both Ankara and Athens|date=April 24, 1964|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> 50,000 more Greeks were deported.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-05-14|title=Why Turkey and Greece cannot reconcile|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/12/14/why-turkey-and-greece-cannot-reconcile|newspaper=The Economist|date=14 December 2017|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> They were given a week to leave the country.

Under the diplomacy of the military regime, there were periodic crises with Turkey, which suspected that the Greek regime was planning a pro-unification coup in Cyprus.\n\n[[File:Grenspost.jpg|thumb|[[Northern Cyprus]] in 2009]]\nA 1971 Turkish law nationalized religious high schools and closed the [[Halki seminary]] on Istanbul's [[Heybeli]] Island which had trained [[Greek Orthodox]] clergy since 1844.\n\nOn July 15, 1974, a band of Greek Cypriot nationalists formed [[EOKA B]], advocating [[Enosis]] (Union) with Greece and, backed by the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, staged a coup against the Cypriot President and [[Archbishop Makarios]]. An ex-[[EOKA]] man, [[Nikos Sampson]] was appointed President.

Once again, war between Greece and Turkey seemed imminent, but actual war was averted when Sampson's coup collapsed a few days later and Makarios returned to power. Also, the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, which failed to confront the Turkish invasion, fell from power on 24 July. The damage to Turkish-Greek relations was done, and the occupation of [[Northern Cyprus]] by Turkish troops would be a sticking point in Greco-Turkish relations for decades to come.\n\nIn 2018, declassified documents of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Bulgaria]] revealed a plan to foment crisis between [[Turkey]] and Greece in 1971.

The [[Balkan Wars]] of 1913 had given Greece all the Aegean islands except [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]], some of them only a few kilometres (barely more than three nautical miles) off the Turkish coast. Since the end of [[World War II]], Turkish officials insisted that this led to questions regarding the [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of territorial waters, air space and other related zones of control. The conflict was motivated both by considerations of military tactical advantages and by questions of economic exploitation of the Aegean. The latter issue became particularly significant as after 1970 there were expectations of finding oil in the Aegean. This was highlighted during the [[1987 Aegean crisis|crisis]] in 1987, when a Turkish ship was about to enter disputed waters to conduct an oil survey. The Greek Prime Minister of the time, [[Andreas Papandreou]], ordered the ship to be sunk if found within disputed waters claimed by Greece. Consultations about this issue were held in [[Davos]] between the Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers.\n\nIssues unresolved to this day concern the mutual delimitation of several zones of control:\n*The width of the [[territorial waters]]. Both sides currently possess 6 nautical miles (11&nbsp;km) off their shores in the Aegean Sea. Greece claims a right to unilateral expansion to 12 nautical miles, based on the International [[Law of the Sea]]. Turkey, which already has expanded its own territorial waters to 12 miles on its other coasts, denies the applicability of the 12-miles rule in the Aegean and has threatened Greece with war in the case it should try to apply it unilaterally.\n*The width of the national airspace. Greece currently claims 10 miles, while Turkey only acknowledges 6 miles.\n*The future delimitation of the [[continental shelf]] zone in the international parts of the Aegean, which would give the states exclusive rights to economic exploitation.\n*The right of Greece to exercise flight control over Turkish military flight activities within the international parts of the Aegean, based on conflicting interpretations of the rules about [[Flight Information Region]]s (FIR) set by the [[ICAO]].\n*Since 1996, the sovereignty over some small uninhabited islets, most notably [[Imia/Kardak]]\n\nThe conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations. Turkish aircraft regularly fly in the zones over which Greece claims control (i.e., the outer four miles of the claimed Greek airspace and the international parts of Athens FIR), while Greek aircraft constantly intercept them. Aircraft from both countries frequently engage in mock dogfights. These operations often cause casualties and losses for both the Greek and Turkish Air Forces.\n\n===Incidents===\n* On 22 July 1974, during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], a pair of Greek [[Northrop F-5|F-5\u0391]]s intercepted a pair of Turkish [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]] near [[Agios Efstratios]]. The aircraft engaged in a dogfight, during which one of the Turkish pilots fired a [[AIM-4 Falcon|Falcon]] missile against one of the F-5s piloted by Thomas Skampardonis. Skampardonis managed to evade the missile and then the other Greek pilot Ioannis Dinopoulos, who up to that point was undetected by the Turks, fired two [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9B]] missiles. The first AIM-9 missed its target but the second shot down one of the F-102s. The pilot of the remaining F-102 became disoriented and fled westwards. When he realized his mistake, he turned east towards the Turkish coast but ran out of fuel. This forced him to ditch his aircraft and crash, suffering fatal injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=107 |title=The Shooting Down of the Turkish F-102s |publisher=acig.info |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6lncnxMFT?url=https://electrical-greece.blogspot.gr/2016/05/the-shooting-down-of-turkish-f-102s-1974.html |archive-date=5 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* On 18 June 1992, a Greek [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F1CG]] crashed near the island of [[Agios Efstratios]] in the Northern Aegean, during a low-altitude dogfight with two Turkish [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]]s.

Furthermore, Turkey still denies access to Cypriot vessels to its territory, an obligation towards the EU with a 2006 deadline. The Turkish government counters that this restriction regarding Cypriot vessels was taken after the trade embargo decision against the portion of Cyprus illegally occupied by Turkey.
