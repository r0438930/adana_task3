The  F/V ''Maverick'' was built by Giddings Boat Works in 1982. She is a 92-foot house aft vessel that holds 120 pots and sleeps between nine and ten people. She was purchased by Rick and Donna Quashnick of [[Warrenton, Oregon]] in 1991. The F/V Maverick was selected for a camera crew for season one in the 2005 opilio crab season, as partner vessel of the [[FV Cornelia Marie|''F/V Cornelia Marie'']]. The ''Maverick'' took part in the rescue efforts for the [[FV Big Valley|''F/V Big Valley'']], which sunk on the first day of the opilio crab season off [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island, Alaska]] losing all but one crew member. She became a featured vessel beginning in the second and third season of [[Deadliest Catch]], joining the [[FV Cornelia Marie|''F/V Cornelia Marie'']], [[FV Northwestern|''F/V Northwestern'']] and [[FV Time Bandit|''F/V Time Bandit'']].\n\n==Current status==\n\nWhile the F/V Maverick is no longer on [[Deadliest Catch]], she is still fishing with owners Rick and Donna Quashnick. The F/V Maverick's homeport is [[Astoria, Oregon]]. As shown in the third season of [[Deadliest Catch]], Captain Rick gave control of the ''Maverick'' to the late Blake Painter for the 2006 king crab season. After the 2006 king crab season was over, Painter gave the ''Maverick'' back to Rick and Donna Quashnick.\n\n==Specifications==\n\n*Year of Construction: 1982\n*Engine: Diesel\n*Hull Construction: Steel\n*Length: 92.7\u2032\n*Breadth: 24.0\u2032\n*Depth: 7.6\u2032\n*Gross Tonnage: 173\n*Net Tonnage: 148\n*Built in 1982 at the Giddings Boat Works in [[Coos Bay, Oregon]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alaskan king crab fishing]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/deadliest-catch Deadliest Catch website]\n*[http://www.giddingsboatworks.com/ Giddings Boat Works website]\n\n{{Deadliest Catch}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maverick, FV}}\n[[Category:1982 ships]]\n[[Category:Fishing ships of the United States]]\n[[Category:Astoria, Oregon]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin |display title=FV ''Maverick''}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n| Ship image=\n| Ship caption=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=[[United States]]\n|Ship flag=[[Image:Flag of the United States.svg|60px]]\n|Ship name=''F/V Maverick''\n|Ship owner=Rick Quashnick and Donna Quashnick\n|Ship operator=Rick Quashnick\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=Giddings Boat Works, [[Coos Bay, Oregon]]\n|Ship yard number=\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=\n|Ship completed=1982\n|Ship christened=\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship in service=1982\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship homeport= [[Astoria, Oregon]]\n|Ship identification=*{{IMO Number|8855073}}\n*{{MMSI Number|367384460}}\n*[[Maritime call sign|Callsign]]: WDE6757\n|Ship fate=\n|Ship status=Active\n|Ship notes=Featured in the [[Discovery]] reality television show ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=[[Fishing vessel]], former Power [[scow]]\n|Ship tonnage=*{{GT|173}} \n*{{NetT|145}}\n|Ship displacement=\n|Ship length={{convert|92.7|ft|abbr=on}}\n|Ship beam={{convert|24|ft|abbr=on}}\n|Ship height=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship depth={{convert|7.6|ft|abbr=on}}\n|Ship ice class=\n|Ship sail plan=\n|Ship power=2x 570 hp Diesel Marine Engines\n|Ship propulsion= Two propellers\n|Ship hydraulics=\n|Ship crane=\n|Ship speed={{convert|8.5|kn}}\n|Ship capacity=120 pots\n|Ship crew=9-10\n|Ship notes=Hull and superstructure, black; \ntrim/wheel house/lettering, grey and red\n}}\n|}\n\nThe '''F/V ''Maverick''''' is a commercial crab fishing vessel that featured on the first three seasons of the [[Discovery]] channel's reality television show [[Deadliest Catch]].
