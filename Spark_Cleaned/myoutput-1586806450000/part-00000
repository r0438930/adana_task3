Its residents are known as Oklahomans (or colloquially, \"[[Okie]]s\"), and its capital and largest city is [[Oklahoma City]].\n\nThe state's name is derived from the [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] words {{wikt-lang|cho|okla}} and {{lang|cho|humma}}, meaning \"red people\".<ref name=\"Oklahoma's Name\" /> It is also known informally by its nickname, \"[[Sooners|The Sooner State]]\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] of 1889, which increased [[European Americans|European-American]] settlement in the eastern [[Indian Territory]]. [[Oklahoma Territory]] and [[Indian Territory]] were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907.\n\nWith ancient mountain ranges, [[prairie]], [[mesa]]s, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the [[Great Plains]], [[Cross Timbers]], and the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]], all regions prone to [[Supercell|severe weather]].<ref name=\"Oklahoma Terrain\"/> Oklahoma is on a confluence of three major American [[cultural area|cultural regions]] and historically served as a route for [[cattle drive]]s, a destination for Southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned [[territories of the United States|territory]] for Native Americans.

Choctaw Nation Chief [[Allen Wright]] suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government on the use of [[Indian Territory]], in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word ''Indian'', ''okla humma'' was a phrase in the Choctaw language that described Native American people as a whole.
