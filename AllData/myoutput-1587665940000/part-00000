His oldest child, Winifred Dodge, married real estate baron [[Wesson Seyburn]], who built his own country retreat {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north of Auburn Heights. The estate included hunting land, dog kennels, a swimming pool, horse stables, and a {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Colonial Revival]] house. Pontiac Township purchased the estate in 1976, and adapted the buildings for government use. Today, it is known as the Auburn Hills Civic Center.\n\nThe first use of the name \"Auburn Hills,\" in 1964, was by [[Oakland Community College]]. They named their campus (a former [[Project Nike|Nike missile base]]) at Featherstone and Squirrel roads for the town and the hilly terrain in the area. Besides Oakland Community College, three other colleges, [[Oakland University]], [[Baker College]], and [[Western Michigan University Thomas M. Cooley Law School]] have campuses partially within the city limits.\n\n=== Incorporation history ===\nAuburn Hills began as Pontiac Township, including the village of Auburn, in 1821, at what is today the corner of Auburn and Squirrel roads. Situated on the [[Clinton River (Michigan)|Clinton River]], it was named by Aaron Webster, the first settler, for [[Auburn, New York|Auburn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. His sawmill and grist mill attracted settlers to Auburn. After the streets were laid out in 1826, Auburn rivaled nearby [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] until the 1860s, when it lost its own prosperity. The town was renamed Amy in 1880, and it officially became Auburn Heights in 1919. Pontiac Township bordered the city of Pontiac on two sides. The township attempted to incorporate as Pontiac Heights in 1971, but was denied by state officials. Pontiac Township became a charter township in 1978, to protect itself from further annexation. In 1983, [[Pontiac Township, Michigan|Pontiac Township]] merged with the village of Auburn Heights to become the City of Auburn Hills. It is not to be confused with the similarly named city of [[Auburn, Michigan]], that exists in [[Bay County, Michigan|Bay County]], near [[Saginaw Bay]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|16.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (0.24%) is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 111\n|1990= 17076\n|2000= 19837\n|2010= 21412\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=24042\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 21,412 people, 8,844 households, and 4,923 families living in the city.

His oldest child, Winifred Dodge, married real estate baron [[Wesson Seyburn]], who built his own country retreat {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north of Auburn Heights. The estate included hunting land, dog kennels, a swimming pool, horse stables, and a {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Colonial Revival]] house. Pontiac Township purchased the estate in 1976, and adapted the buildings for government use. Today, it is known as the Auburn Hills Civic Center.\n\nThe first use of the name \"Auburn Hills,\" in 1964, was by [[Oakland Community College]]. They named their campus (a former [[Project Nike|Nike missile base]]) at Featherstone and Squirrel roads for the town and the hilly terrain in the area. Besides Oakland Community College, three other colleges, [[Oakland University]], [[Baker College]], and [[Western Michigan University Thomas M. Cooley Law School]] have campuses partially within the city limits.\n\n=== Incorporation history ===\nAuburn Hills began as Pontiac Township, including the village of Auburn, in 1821, at what is today the corner of Auburn and Squirrel roads. Situated on the [[Clinton River (Michigan)|Clinton River]], it was named by Aaron Webster, the first settler, for [[Auburn, New York|Auburn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. His sawmill and grist mill attracted settlers to Auburn. After the streets were laid out in 1826, Auburn rivaled nearby [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] until the 1860s, when it lost its own prosperity. The town was renamed Amy in 1880, and it officially became Auburn Heights in 1919. Pontiac Township bordered the city of Pontiac on two sides. The township attempted to incorporate as Pontiac Heights in 1971, but was denied by state officials. Pontiac Township became a charter township in 1978, to protect itself from further annexation. In 1983, [[Pontiac Township, Michigan|Pontiac Township]] merged with the village of Auburn Heights to become the City of Auburn Hills. It is not to be confused with the similarly named city of [[Auburn, Michigan]], that exists in [[Bay County, Michigan|Bay County]], near [[Saginaw Bay]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|16.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 111\n|1990= 17076\n|2000= 19837\n|2010= 21412\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=24042\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 21,412 people, 8,844 households, and 4,923 families living in the city.
