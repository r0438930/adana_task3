The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As a result of these differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called \"[[free rider problem]]\"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not do too much (the \"free driver\" problem).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12120 | volume=117 | issue=4 | title=A Voting Architecture for the Governance of Free-Driver Externalities, with Application to Geoengineering | journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics | pages=1049\u20131068 | last1 = Weitzman | first1 = Martin L.| year=2015 | url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:17368469 }}</ref>\n\nDomestic and international governance vary by the proposed climate engineering method.

However, some may be able to contribute to reducing climate risks within relatively short times.\n\nAll proposed solar radiation management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate. The least costly proposals are budgeted at tens of billions of US dollars annually, or around 0.1% of world GDP.<ref name=\"Climate Intervention\"/> [[Space sunshade]]s would cost far more. Who was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques may be hard to agree with. However, the more effective solar radiation management proposals currently appear to have low enough direct implementation costs that it would be in the interests of several single countries to implement them unilaterally.\n\nIn contrast, carbon dioxide removal, like greenhouse gas emissions reductions, have impacts proportional to their scale. These techniques would not be \"implemented\" in the same sense as solar radiation management ones. The problem structure of carbon dioxide removal resembles that of emissions cuts, in that both are somewhat expensive [[Public good (economics)|public goods]], whose provision presents a [[Collective action|collective action problem]].\n\nBefore they are ready to be used, most techniques would require technical development processes that are not yet in place. As a result, many promising proposed climate engineering do not yet have the engineering development or experimental evidence to determine their feasibility or efficacy.\n\n==Public perception==\nIn a 2017 focus group study conducted by the [[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences]] (CIRES) in the United States, Japan, New Zealand, and Sweden, participants were asked about carbon sequestration options, reflection proposals such as with space mirrors, or brightening of clouds, and their majority responses could be summed up as follows:\n* What happens if the technologies backfire with unintended consequences?\n* Are these solutions treating the symptoms of climate change rather than the cause?\n* Shouldn't we just change our lifestyle and consumption patterns to fight climate change, making climate engineering a last resort?\n* Isn't there a greater need to address political solutions to reduce our emissions?\nModerators floated then the idea of a future \"[[Global warming|climate emergency]]\" such as rapid environmental change. The participants felt that mitigation and adaptation to climate change were strongly preferred options in such a situation, and climate engineering was seen as a last resort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/news/study-illuminates-public-perceptions-climate-engineering|date=October 9, 2017|title=Study Illuminates Public Perceptions of Climate Engineering|work=CIRES}}</ref>\nSome extremists have proposed that there are secret government actions implementing geoengineering on a large scale, affecting weather to produce winter, or cooling, or large fires, or other detrimental effects.  There is no evidence to substantiate these unorthodox claims. Yet, search engines routinely link to these \"fake news\" and [[conspiracy theories]] sites.\n\n==Evaluation of climate engineering==\nMost of what is known about the suggested techniques are based on laboratory experiments, observations of natural phenomena, and on [[computer modeling]] techniques. Some proposed climate engineering methods employ methods that have analogs in natural phenomena such as [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]] and [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. As such, studies about the efficacy of these methods can draw on information already available from other research, such as that following the [[1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo]]. However, comparative evaluation of the relative merits of each technology is complicated, especially given modeling uncertainties and the early stage of engineering development of many proposed climate engineering methods.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Geo-Engineering Inquiry|date=November 17, 2008|url=http://www.imeche.org/media/Public+Affairs/geoenginq.htm|website=Institution of Mechanical Engineers|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220180833/http://www.imeche.org/media/Public+Affairs/geoenginq.htm|archive-date=2008-12-20}}</ref>\n\nReports into climate engineering have also been published in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]<ref name=\"imeche09\"/> and the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/> The IMechE report examined a small subset of proposed methods (air capture, urban albedo and algal-based {{co2}} capture techniques), and its main conclusions were that climate engineering should be researched and trialed at the small scale alongside a wider [[decarbonization]] of the economy.<ref name=\"imeche09\"/>\n\nThe Royal Society review examined a wide range of proposed climate engineering methods and evaluated them in terms of effectiveness, affordability, timeliness and safety (assigning [[qualitative data|qualitative]] estimates in each assessment). The report divided proposed methods into \"carbon dioxide removal\" (CDR) and \"solar radiation management\" (SRM) approaches that respectively address longwave and shortwave radiation. The key recommendations of the report were that \"Parties to the [[UNFCCC]] should make increased efforts towards mitigating and adapting to climate change, and in particular to agreeing to global emissions reductions\", and that \"[nothing] now known about climate engineering options gives any reason to diminish these efforts\".<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/> Nonetheless, the report also recommended that \"research and development of climate engineering options should be undertaken to investigate whether low-risk methods can be made available if it becomes necessary to reduce the rate of warming this century\".<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/>\n\nIn a 2009 review study, Lenton and Vaughan evaluated a range of proposed climate engineering techniques from those that sequester {{co2}} from the atmosphere and decrease [[outgoing longwave radiation|longwave radiation]] trapping, to those that decrease the Earth's receipt of [[shortwave radiation]].<ref name=\"lenton09\"/> In order to permit a comparison of disparate techniques, they used a common evaluation for each technique based on its effect on net radiative forcing. As such, the review examined the scientific plausibility of proposed methods rather than the practical considerations such as engineering feasibility or economic cost. Lenton and Vaughan found that \"[air] capture and storage shows the greatest potential, combined with afforestation, reforestation and bio-char production\", and noted that \"other suggestions that have received considerable media attention, in particular, \"ocean pipes\" appear to be ineffective\".<ref name=\"lenton09\"/> They concluded that \"[climate] geoengineering is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of {{co2}} emissions, rather than as an alternative to it\".<ref name=\"lenton09\"/>\n\nIn October 2011, a [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] panel issued a report urging immediate researching and testing in case \"the [[climate]] system reaches a 'tipping point' and swift remedial action is required\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/earth/04climate.html \"Group Urges Research Into Aggressive Efforts to Fight Climate Change\"], October 4, 2011</ref>\n\n===National Academy of Sciences===\nThe [[National Academy of Sciences]] conducted a 21-month project to study the potential impacts, benefits, and costs of two different types of climate engineering: carbon dioxide removal and albedo modification (solar radiation management).

SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low.

The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As a result of these differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called \"[[free rider problem]]\"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not do too much (the \"free driver\" problem).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12120 | volume=117 | issue=4 | title=A Voting Architecture for the Governance of Free-Driver Externalities, with Application to Geoengineering | journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics | pages=1049\u20131068 | last1 = Weitzman | first1 = Martin L.| year=2015 | url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:17368469 }}</ref>\n\nDomestic and international governance vary by the proposed climate engineering method.

The [[London Convention (1972)|London Convention]] addresses some aspects of the law in relation to [[ocean fertilization]].

However, some may be able to contribute to reducing climate risks within relatively short times.\n\nAll proposed solar radiation management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate. The least costly proposals are budgeted at tens of billions of US dollars annually, or around 0.1% of world GDP.<ref name=\"Climate Intervention\"/> [[Space sunshade]]s would cost far more. Who was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques may be hard to agree with. However, the more effective solar radiation management proposals currently appear to have low enough direct implementation costs that it would be in the interests of several single countries to implement them unilaterally.\n\nIn contrast, carbon dioxide removal, like greenhouse gas emissions reductions, have impacts proportional to their scale. These techniques would not be \"implemented\" in the same sense as solar radiation management ones. The problem structure of carbon dioxide removal resembles that of emissions cuts, in that both are somewhat expensive [[Public good (economics)|public goods]], whose provision presents a [[Collective action|collective action problem]].\n\nBefore they are ready to be used, most techniques would require technical development processes that are not yet in place. As a result, many promising proposed climate engineering do not yet have the engineering development or experimental evidence to determine their feasibility or efficacy.\n\n==Public perception==\nIn a 2017 focus group study conducted by the [[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences]] (CIRES) in the United States, Japan, New Zealand, and Sweden, participants were asked about carbon sequestration options, reflection proposals such as with space mirrors, or brightening of clouds, and their majority responses could be summed up as follows:\n* What happens if the technologies backfire with unintended consequences?\n* Are these solutions treating the symptoms of climate change rather than the cause?\n* Shouldn't we just change our lifestyle and consumption patterns to fight climate change, making climate engineering a last resort?\n* Isn't there a greater need to address political solutions to reduce our emissions?\nModerators floated then the idea of a future \"[[Global warming|climate emergency]]\" such as rapid environmental change. The participants felt that mitigation and adaptation to climate change were strongly preferred options in such a situation, and climate engineering was seen as a last resort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/news/study-illuminates-public-perceptions-climate-engineering|date=October 9, 2017|title=Study Illuminates Public Perceptions of Climate Engineering|work=CIRES}}</ref>\nSome extremists have proposed that there are secret government actions implementing geoengineering on a large scale, affecting weather to produce winter, or cooling, or large fires, or other detrimental effects.  There is no evidence to substantiate these unorthodox claims. Yet, search engines routinely link to these \"fake news\" and [[conspiracy theories]] sites.\n\n==Evaluation of climate engineering==\nMost of what is known about the suggested techniques are based on laboratory experiments, observations of natural phenomena, and on [[computer modeling]] techniques. Some proposed climate engineering methods employ methods that have analogs in natural phenomena such as [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]] and [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. As such, studies about the efficacy of these methods can draw on information already available from other research, such as that following the [[1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo]].

The report divided proposed methods into \"carbon dioxide removal\" (CDR) and \"solar radiation management\" (SRM) approaches that respectively address longwave and shortwave radiation. The key recommendations of the report were that \"Parties to the [[UNFCCC]] should make increased efforts towards mitigating and adapting to climate change, and in particular to agreeing to global emissions reductions\", and that \"[nothing] now known about climate engineering options gives any reason to diminish these efforts\".<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/> Nonetheless, the report also recommended that \"research and development of climate engineering options should be undertaken to investigate whether low-risk methods can be made available if it becomes necessary to reduce the rate of warming this century\".<ref name=\"Royal Society Policy Document\"/>\n\nIn a 2009 review study, Lenton and Vaughan evaluated a range of proposed climate engineering techniques from those that sequester {{co2}} from the atmosphere and decrease [[outgoing longwave radiation|longwave radiation]] trapping, to those that decrease the Earth's receipt of [[shortwave radiation]].<ref name=\"lenton09\"/> In order to permit a comparison of disparate techniques, they used a common evaluation for each technique based on its effect on net radiative forcing. As such, the review examined the scientific plausibility of proposed methods rather than the practical considerations such as engineering feasibility or economic cost. Lenton and Vaughan found that \"[air] capture and storage shows the greatest potential, combined with afforestation, reforestation and bio-char production\", and noted that \"other suggestions that have received considerable media attention, in particular, \"ocean pipes\" appear to be ineffective\".<ref name=\"lenton09\"/> They concluded that \"[climate] geoengineering is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of {{co2}} emissions, rather than as an alternative to it\".<ref name=\"lenton09\"/>\n\nIn October 2011, a [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] panel issued a report urging immediate researching and testing in case \"the [[climate]] system reaches a 'tipping point' and swift remedial action is required\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/earth/04climate.html \"Group Urges Research Into Aggressive Efforts to Fight Climate Change\"], October 4, 2011</ref>\n\n===National Academy of Sciences===\nThe [[National Academy of Sciences]] conducted a 21-month project to study the potential impacts, benefits, and costs of two different types of climate engineering: carbon dioxide removal and albedo modification (solar radiation management).

Its [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] states:<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|pp = 575, 632}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote><poem>Models consistently suggest that SRM would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG concentrations and no SRM; however, there would also be residual regional differences in climate (e.g., temperature and rainfall) when compared to a climate without elevated GHGs....\n\nModels suggest that if SRM methods were realizable they would be effective in countering increasing temperatures, and would be less, but still, effective in countering some other climate changes. SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low. There are also many (political, ethical, and practical) issues involving geoengineering that are beyond the scope of this report.</poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Environment|Weather|Global warming}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arctic geoengineering]]\n* [[Carbon negative fuel]]\n* [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]\n* [[Earth systems engineering and management]]\n* ''[[Five Ways to Save the World]]''\n* [[Haida Gwaii#2012 controversy around depositing iron in the ocean|Haida Gwaii geoengineering controversy]]\n* [[Land surface effects on climate]]\n* [[List of geoengineering topics]]\n* [[One Earth Climate Model]]\n* [[Planetary engineering]]\n* [[Project Stormfury]]\n* [[Technological fix]]\n* [[Terraforming]]\n* [[Weather modification]]\n* [[Weather modification in North America]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{YouTube|id=1hhzrormtP4|title=Geoengineering May Be the Answer to Climate Change}} published December 14, 2019 [[Vice News]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Kintisch|first=Eli|title=Hack the Planet: Science's Best Hope, or Worst Nightmare, for Averting Climate Catastrophe|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=if5xZw7MiwAC}}|publisher=Wiley|year=2010|isbn=978-0-470-52426-8|location=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|last=Goodell|first=Jeff|title=How to Cool the Planet: Geoengineering and the Audacious Quest to Fix Earth's Climate|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5hAnBB-wmH4C}}|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2010|isbn=978-0-618-99061-0|location=}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Clive|title=Earthmasters: Playing God with the Climate|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6RoK8Xh_mHAC}}|publisher=Allen & Unwin|year=2013|isbn=978-1743312933|location=|pages=|authorlink=}}\n* {{cite book|last=Keith|first=David|title=A Case for Climate Engineering|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=JXf6AAAAQBAJA}}|publisher=MIT Press|year=2013|isbn=9780262019828|location=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|last=Morton|first=Oliver|title=The Planet Remade: How Geoengineering Could Change the World|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=428uCgAAQBAJ}}|publisher=Princeton|year=2015|isbn=9780691175904|location=|pages=}}\n* {{cite report | author=Royal Society working group|publisher=The [[Royal Society]] |url=http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf |title=Geoengineering the Climate: Science, Governance and Uncertainty | date=2009 |location=London |format=PDF |ISBN=978-0-85403-773-5 |id=RS1636 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}\n* U.S. National Academies (2015).
