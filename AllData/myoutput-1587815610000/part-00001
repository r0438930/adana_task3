{"title_page": "Nicholas St Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Nicholas St. Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth''' (c.1550\u20131607) was a leading member of the [[Anglo-Irish]] nobility in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Despite openly professing his [[Roman Catholic]] faith, he enjoyed the trust of [[Elizabeth I]] and of  successive Lord Deputies of Ireland, and was even forgiven by the English  Crown  for signing a petition against the [[Penal Laws]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was the eldest surviving son of [[Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth (d. 1589)|Christopher, 8th Baron Howth]] and his first wife Elizabeth Plunket  of [[Beaulieu House and Gardens, Co. Louth|Beaulieu House]], [[ County Louth]]. His date of birth is often given as 1555, but  was probably some years earlier: Elrington Ball states that he was well into middle age when his father died,<ref name=eball>Ball, F. Elrington ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thoms and Co. Dublin 1902\u20131920</ref> and in 1605 he was described as being \"too old to be likely  to live long\".\n\nHis early life cannot have been   happy, as  his father was notorious for his cruelty to his wife and children. In 1577 Nicholas's teenage sister Jane died after being severely beaten by their father, and his mother was so ill-treated   that the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] (the Irish equivalen of. [[Star Chamber]])  granted her a [[judicial separation]].  Lord Howth  was fined  for his cruelty to his wife and daughter,  and briefly imprisoned.<ref>Crawford, Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber'' 1571\u20131641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2006</ref>\n\nAccording to a well-known legend [[Granuaile]], the celebrated Pirate Queen of Galway in about 1575 arrived unannounced at [[Howth Castle]] for dinner, only to find the gates barred; in retaliation for the discourtesy she took the youthful heir [[hostage]] until the family apologised. Elrington Ball suggests  that the story may be  partly  based on fact<ref name=eball/>- but if the heir was a child  at the relevant time this probably    refers  to Nicholas' eldest son Christopher, not  to Nicholas himself. \n\n[[Image:Howth Castle.jpg|thumb|Howth Castle]]\n\nIn the 1580s he lived  at Platten in [[County Meath|Meath]],  where his wife had inherited some  property. He was [[knighted]] in 1588 and succeeded his father as baron the following year.\n\n== Political career ==\nIn Elrington Ball's view Lord Howth \"was devoted to the interests of [[the Pale]] and did not always find it easy to reconcile that with the requirements of Government. \"<ref name=eball/>  This was especially  true  after it became public knowledge that he practiced the Roman Catholic faith.  \n\nHis initial relations with the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[William FitzWilliam (Lord Deputy)|Sir William FitzWilliam]], were friendly, and he was appointed guardian of the Pale in the Deputy's absence. Shortly afterwards relations between the two men cooled when Nicholas became involved in the long and bitter [[feud]] between the Nugent and Dillon families family, headed by [[Christopher Nugent|Christopher, Baron Delvin]] on the one hand and Sir [[Robert Dillon (judge)|Robert Dillon]], the [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]] on the other. The Nugent family pursued Dillon relentlessly with charges of [[corruption]] for several years until he was eventually cleared  of any wrongdoing in 1593, and Lord Howth was closely associated with the attack.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|last=Dunlop|first=Robert|wstitle=St. Lawrence, Nicholas|volume=50}}</ref> His motives are unclear; Lord Delvin claimed that Howth had been injured in some way by the Lord  Deputy, but Howth himself proclaimed his trust in him. More likely he was influenced by his second wife's father, Sir [[Nicholas White]], another bitter enemy of Dillon. This would explain his loss of favour with the Crown, since White's loyalty was deeply suspect, and he eventually died a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]].\n\nHowth in time was restored to favour and enjoyed friendly relations with the new  Lord Deputy, [[William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh|Lord Russell]], whom he entertained at Howth Castle on his arrival in Ireland. The following year he accompanied Russell on his campaign against the O'Byrnes of [[Wicklow]] and the  Lord Deputy wrote that Howth deserved some words of thanks from the Queen.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> In 1598 he was praised highly for being one of the few nobles of [[the Pale]] to render useful assistance to Sir [[Henry Bagenal]] in his campaign against [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]], although he later complained of the depredations of Bagenal's soldiers in the Pale.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1600 he was again the first of the leaders of the Pale to entertain a new Lord Deputy, [[Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy]], who formed a very high opinion of him and appointed him to act as Deputy in his absence.\nIn 1601 he went to London to discuss Irish affairs: the Queen who had already met and been impressed by Howth's  eldest son Christopher, also formed a high opinion of Howth himself.<ref name=eball/> On his return he was appointed to the [[Privy Council of Ireland]].\n\n== Religious conflict ==\nHowth's first wife Margaret was a daughter of Sir [[Christopher Barnewall]] of Turvey, who while outwardly conforming to the [[Church of Ireland]], had privately adhered to the Roman Catholic faith. Christopher's son [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] emerged in the early 1600s as spokesman for the Catholic nobility. Although they had been on bad terms  in the 1590s when they were engaged in a [[lawsuit]], he and Howth later became friendly and Howth, like Barnewall, openly professed his Catholic faith. In December 1605 he was one of the signatories to a petition that the [[Penal Laws]] should be modified, rather than extended.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> This was a risky step to take,  particularly just after the discovery of the [[Gunpowder Plot]], and Barnewall was sent to the [[Tower of London]] as a result, but Howth was left in peace. He enjoyed the confidence of yet another Deputy, Sir [[Arthur Chichester]], who was said to openly dispute with him the rival merits of the two faiths (this is rather surprising in view of Chichester's  vigorous enforcement of the [[Penal Laws]]). Possibly to forestall any action against Howth, Chichester wrote that he was old and would probably not live long.<ref name=eball/> This  prediction proved to be correct: Howth died in May 1607 and was buried in Howth Abbey.\n\n== Family ==\nBy his first wife Margaret (died 1576),   fifth daughter of Sir [[Christopher Barnewall]] of Turvey  and  his wife Marion Sherle,  he had three children:\n*[[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]\n*Thomas, who served with the [[Spanish army]]  in the [[Netherlands]]\n*Mary, who married William Eustace of [[Castlemartin House and Estate|Castlemartin]].\n\nBy his second wife Mary White, daughter of Sir [[Nicholas White]], [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]]  and his second  wife  Miss Brereton of Kilcrow, County Meath,  he  had six further children:\n*Richard\n*Almeric\n*Edward\n*Margaret, who married firstly Jenico Preston, 5th [[Viscount Gormanston]] and secondly [[Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall]]\n*Eleanor\n*Alison (see below).\n\n===Alison Luttrell===\nHis daughter Alison St Lawrence  married, as  his second wife, Thomas Luttrell of [[Luttrellstown Castle]],  [[Irish House of Commons|MP]]  for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin County]],   in 1616.
