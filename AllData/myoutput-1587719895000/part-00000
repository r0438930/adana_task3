As a result of growing trade between the United Kingdom and the United States, Price Waterhouse opened an office in New York in 1890, and the American firm itself soon expanded rapidly. The original British firm opened an office in [[Liverpool]] in 1904 and then elsewhere in the United Kingdom and worldwide, each time establishing a separate partnership in each country: the worldwide practice of PW was therefore a federation of collaborating firms that had grown organically rather than being the result of an international merger.<ref name=\"pwhistory\" />\n\nIn a further effort to take advantage of [[economies of scale]], PW and [[Arthur Andersen]] discussed a merger in 1989<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/companies/account.html |title=University of Washington: Accounting firms and organisations |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu}}</ref> but the negotiations failed mainly because of conflicts of interest such as Andersen's strong commercial links with [[IBM]] and PW's audit of IBM as well as the radically different cultures of the two firms.  It was said by those involved with the failed merger that at the end of the discussion, the partners at the table realized they had different views of business, and the potential merger was scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-26/business/fi-365_1_price-waterhouse|title=Accounting Giants Call Off Merger Plan : Price Waterhouse, Arthur Andersen Cite 'Differences'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=26 September 1989|accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1998 to present===\nIn 1998, Price Waterhouse merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form PricewaterhouseCoopers (written with a lowercase \"w\" and a [[camelcase]] \"C\").<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060625115425/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3755/is_199709/ai_n8768518 Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand to merge] Weekly Corporate Growth Report 29 September 1997</ref>\n\nAfter the merger the firm had a large professional [[Consultant|consulting]] branch, as did other major accountancy firms, generating much of its fees. Management Consulting Services (MCS) was the fastest growing and often most profitable area of the practice, though it was cyclical. The major cause for growth in the 1990s was the implementation of complex integrated [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems for multi-national companies. PwC came under increasing pressure to avoid conflicts of interests by not providing some consulting services, particularly financial systems design and implementation, to its audit clients. Since it audited a large proportion of the world's largest companies, this was beginning to limit its consulting market. These conflicts increased as additional services including outsourcing of IT and back office operations were developed. For these reasons, in 2000, [[Ernst & Young]] was the first of the [[Big Four auditors|Big Four]] to sell its consulting services, to [[Capgemini]].<ref>[http://www.news.com/2100-1017-237396.html Ernst & Young sells consulting unit to Cap Gemini] Cnet News, 29 February 2000</ref>\n\nThe fallout from the [[Enron]], [[Worldcom]] and other [[Enron scandal|financial auditing scandals]] led to the passage of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] (2002), severely limiting interaction between management consulting and auditing (assurance) services. PwC Consulting began to conduct business under its own name rather than as the MCS division of PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC therefore planned to capitalize on MCS's rapid growth through its sale to [[Hewlett Packard]] (for a reported $17 billion) but negotiations broke down in 2000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1021544.stm Hewlett-Packard drops PWC bid] BBC News, 13 November 2000</ref>\n\nIn 2000, PwC acquired Canada's largest SAP consulting partner Omnilogic Systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/news/business/article/637077--passion-for-business-takes-entrepreneur-from-software-to-cars-to-music|title=Passion for business takes entrepreneur from software to cars to music|work=therecord.com}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2002 Arthur Andersen, LLP affiliates in Hong Kong and China completed talks to join PricewaterhouseCoopers, China.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726114903/http://www.muzi.com/cc/english/10318%2C19931.shtml?q=1201761 Andersen Affiliates in China to Join Rival] Singapore News, 21 March 2002</ref>\n\nPwC announced in May 2002 that its consulting activities would be spun off as an independent entity and hired an outside CEO to run the global firm.

Hopkins}}\nIn 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that Price Waterhouse must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision regarding employment would have been the same if [[sex discrimination]] had not occurred. The accounting firm failed to prove that the same decision to postpone [[Ann Hopkins]]'s promotion to partnership would have still been made in the absence of sex discrimination, and therefore, the employment decision constituted sex discrimination under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The significance of the Supreme Court's ruling was twofold. First, it established that gender stereotyping is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the [[Mixed motive discrimination|mixed-motive framework]] as an evidentiary framework for proving discrimination under a disparate treatment theory even when lawful reasons for the adverse employment action are also present.<ref>Goldstein, Leslie. \"Gender Stereotyping and the Workplace: Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989).\" 2006. The Constitutional and Legal Rights of Women, 3rd ed. Los Angeles: Roxbury, 2006. 167\u201375. Print.''</ref> Hopkins's candidacy for partnership was put on indefinite hold.

General Re transferred $500 million in anticipated claims and premiums to AIG. ''BusinessWeek'' asked: \"Did the auditor do its job by verifying that AIG was assuming risk on claims beyond the $500 million, thus allowing AIG to account for the deal as insurance? That's Accounting 101 in any reinsurance transaction.\"<ref name=\"businessweek\"/>\n\nPwC was also criticised by several witnesses during the investigation into AIG's collapse, after the insurer was unable to fulfil its collateral obligations to [[Goldman Sachs]]. The insurer was expected to cover the difference in value between the [[credit default swap]] contracts it had sold to Goldman Sachs, however the head of the unit at AIG disagreed with the valuation that Goldman presented. According to a memo published by ''Business Insider'', witnesses wondered how PwC was signing off on the accounts for both AIG and Goldman Sachs, when they were using different valuation methods for the swaps contracts (and therefore booked different values for them in their accounts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/joe-cassano-on-goldman-aig-dispute-2016-3?r=US&IR=T|title=We just got a new insight into a crucial crisis-era dispute between Goldman Sachs and AIG|website=Business Insider|date=11 March 2016|accessdate=2 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===ChuoAoyama Suspension===\n{{Nihongo|ChuoAoyama Audit Corporation|\u4e2d\u592e\u9752\u5c71\u76e3\u67fb\u6cd5\u4eba|Ch\u016b\u014d-Aoyama Kansa H\u014djin}} was the Japanese affiliate of assurance service of PwC from April 2000 to 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/10-088.pdf|title=Audit Quality and Auditor Reputation: Evidence from Japan}}</ref> In May 2006, the Financial Services Agency of Japan suspended ChuoAoyama from provision of some statutory auditing services for two months<ref>{{cite document|title=In May 2006, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) suspended ChuoAoyama for two months|ssrn=1557231}}</ref> following the collapse of cosmetics company Kanebo, of which three of the partners were found assisting with accounting fraud for boosting earnings by the company of about $1.9 billion over the course of five years.

It set up the PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata, and some of ChuoAoyama's accountants (but most of the international divisions) moved to the new firm. ChuoAoyama resumed operations on 1 September 2006 under the Misuzu name. However, by this point the two firms combined had 30% fewer clients than did ChuoAoyama prior to its suspension.

PwC's audits were the foundation for the firm's defense in a series of continuing trials against former chief executive, [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], and the former majority shareholder, [[Platon Lebedev]]. The Russian authorities then went after PwC. In March 2007 police raided PwC's Moscow offices, confiscating documents related to Yukos and charging and convicting PwC of failing to pay 243 million rubles, or $9.4 million, in taxes.

It was said by those involved with the failed merger that at the end of the discussion, the partners at the table realized they had different views of business, and the potential merger was scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-26/business/fi-365_1_price-waterhouse|title=Accounting Giants Call Off Merger Plan : Price Waterhouse, Arthur Andersen Cite 'Differences'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=26 September 1989|accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1998 to present===\nIn 1998, Price Waterhouse merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form PricewaterhouseCoopers (written with a lowercase \"w\" and a [[camelcase]] \"C\").<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060625115425/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3755/is_199709/ai_n8768518 Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand to merge] Weekly Corporate Growth Report 29 September 1997</ref>\n\nAfter the merger the firm had a large professional [[Consultant|consulting]] branch, as did other major accountancy firms, generating much of its fees. Management Consulting Services (MCS) was the fastest growing and often most profitable area of the practice, though it was cyclical. The major cause for growth in the 1990s was the implementation of complex integrated [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems for multi-national companies. PwC came under increasing pressure to avoid conflicts of interests by not providing some consulting services, particularly financial systems design and implementation, to its audit clients. Since it audited a large proportion of the world's largest companies, this was beginning to limit its consulting market. These conflicts increased as additional services including outsourcing of IT and back office operations were developed. For these reasons, in 2000, [[Ernst & Young]] was the first of the [[Big Four auditors|Big Four]] to sell its consulting services, to [[Capgemini]].<ref>[http://www.news.com/2100-1017-237396.html Ernst & Young sells consulting unit to Cap Gemini] Cnet News, 29 February 2000</ref>\n\nThe fallout from the [[Enron]], [[Worldcom]] and other [[Enron scandal|financial auditing scandals]] led to the passage of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] (2002), severely limiting interaction between management consulting and auditing (assurance) services. PwC Consulting began to conduct business under its own name rather than as the MCS division of PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC therefore planned to capitalize on MCS's rapid growth through its sale to [[Hewlett Packard]] (for a reported $17 billion) but negotiations broke down in 2000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1021544.stm Hewlett-Packard drops PWC bid] BBC News, 13 November 2000</ref>\n\nIn 2000, PwC acquired Canada's largest SAP consulting partner Omnilogic Systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/news/business/article/637077--passion-for-business-takes-entrepreneur-from-software-to-cars-to-music|title=Passion for business takes entrepreneur from software to cars to music|work=therecord.com}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2002 Arthur Andersen, LLP affiliates in Hong Kong and China completed talks to join PricewaterhouseCoopers, China.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726114903/http://www.muzi.com/cc/english/10318%2C19931.shtml?q=1201761 Andersen Affiliates in China to Join Rival] Singapore News, 21 March 2002</ref>\n\nPwC announced in May 2002 that its consulting activities would be spun off as an independent entity and hired an outside CEO to run the global firm.

Hopkins}}\nIn 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that Price Waterhouse must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision regarding employment would have been the same if [[sex discrimination]] had not occurred. The accounting firm failed to prove that the same decision to postpone [[Ann Hopkins]]'s promotion to partnership would have still been made in the absence of sex discrimination, and therefore, the employment decision constituted sex discrimination under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The significance of the Supreme Court's ruling was twofold. First, it established that gender stereotyping is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the [[Mixed motive discrimination|mixed-motive framework]] as an evidentiary framework for proving discrimination under a disparate treatment theory even when lawful reasons for the adverse employment action are also present.<ref>Goldstein, Leslie. \"Gender Stereotyping and the Workplace: Price Waterhouse v.

General Re transferred $500 million in anticipated claims and premiums to AIG.

The insurer was expected to cover the difference in value between the [[credit default swap]] contracts it had sold to Goldman Sachs, however the head of the unit at AIG disagreed with the valuation that Goldman presented. According to a memo published by ''Business Insider'', witnesses wondered how PwC was signing off on the accounts for both AIG and Goldman Sachs, when they were using different valuation methods for the swaps contracts (and therefore booked different values for them in their accounts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/joe-cassano-on-goldman-aig-dispute-2016-3?r=US&IR=T|title=We just got a new insight into a crucial crisis-era dispute between Goldman Sachs and AIG|website=Business Insider|date=11 March 2016|accessdate=2 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===ChuoAoyama Suspension===\n{{Nihongo|ChuoAoyama Audit Corporation|\u4e2d\u592e\u9752\u5c71\u76e3\u67fb\u6cd5\u4eba|Ch\u016b\u014d-Aoyama Kansa H\u014djin}} was the Japanese affiliate of assurance service of PwC from April 2000 to 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/10-088.pdf|title=Audit Quality and Auditor Reputation: Evidence from Japan}}</ref> In May 2006, the Financial Services Agency of Japan suspended ChuoAoyama from provision of some statutory auditing services for two months<ref>{{cite document|title=In May 2006, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) suspended ChuoAoyama for two months|ssrn=1557231}}</ref> following the collapse of cosmetics company Kanebo, of which three of the partners were found assisting with accounting fraud for boosting earnings by the company of about $1.9 billion over the course of five years.
