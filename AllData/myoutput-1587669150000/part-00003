A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9\u201312 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9\u201312 declined by 14% in states that established same-sex marriage, resulting in about 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage. The lead researcher of the study observed that \"laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel more hopeful for the future\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Difference-in-Differences Analysis of the Association Between State Same-Sex Marriage Policies and Adolescent Suicide Attempts|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=171|issue=4|pages=350\u2013356|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.4529|pmid=28241285|pmc=5848493|year=2017|last1=Raifman|first1=Julia|last2=Moscoe|first2=Ellen|last3=Austin|first3=S.

EBSCO. 29 September 2009</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the ''[[Gender Recognition Act 2004]]'' allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archivedate=17 October 2007|accessdate=20 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender.

A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9\u201312 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9\u201312 declined by 14% in states that established same-sex marriage, resulting in about 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage.

EBSCO. 29 September 2009</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the ''[[Gender Recognition Act 2004]]'' allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archivedate=17 October 2007|accessdate=20 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/sweden-ends-forced-sterilization-trans110113|title=Sweden ends forced sterilization of trans|date=11 January 2013|website=gaystarnews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, transgender and intersex marriages can be subject to legal complications.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Deborah |first1=Anthony |title=CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE: TRANSSEXUAL MARRIAGE AND THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN SEX AND LEGAL SEX. |journal=Texas Journal of Women & the Law |date=Spring 2012 |volume=21 |issue=2 }}</ref> As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state,<ref>{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html|title=U.S. Defends Marriage Law|work=The New York Times|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref> as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps|title=Movement Advancement Project {{!}} Equality Maps|website=www.lgbtmap.org|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>\n\n===Divorce===\n{{Main|Divorce of same-sex couples}}\nIn the United States of America before the case of ''Obergefell v.
