Curtis discovers that Hayden's boyfriend, [[Nikolas Cassadine]] ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]), was actually responsible for the shooting that left Hayden comatose. Curtis is soon revealed to be the brother-in-law of Police Commissioner [[Jordan Ashford]] ([[Vinessa Antoine]]) and uncle of her son, [[TJ Ashford|TJ]] ([[Tequan Richmond]]). Jordan is not happy to see Curtis, and demands that he leave town. Curtis becomes attracted to [[Valerie Spencer]] ([[Brytni Sarpy]]), an officer in training. Jordan tries to warn Valerie away from Curtis. Curtis reveals that he had a cocaine addiction, and Jordan later states that it led to him losing his job as a DEA agent. Curtis starts dating Valerie, and starts getting to know TJ. Curtis reveals that he told his brother, Tommy, that TJ was actually Shawn's son. Curtis admits to Jordan that he regrets what he did, but overhears, and is furious with his mother for lying to him. He also talks to Curtis, who convinces TJ to give Jordan another chance. Curtis tries to convince Jordan to give him a job as an officer, saying that he's changed, but Jordan has a hard time trusting him. Curtis is hired by [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]) to find who planted a bomb in his car, which ended up killing [[Morgan Corinthos]] ([[Bryan Craig]]). Curtis suspects [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]), Morgan's father and Julian's rival. When Curtis goes behind Valerie's back to get evidence, Valerie breaks up with him. However, Curtis later realizes someone else is involved. When he starts tracking down his lead, Julian abruptly fires him. Curtis is left suspicious, and continues to investigate. He later teams up with [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason]] ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) and [[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]] ([[Kelly Monaco]]) to find Morgan's killer. They found out that it was Julian's sister [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Olivia St. John|Olivia Jerome]] ([[Tonja Walker]]) that did it and framed Sonny in covering her tracks as well as kidnapping Sonny's longtime best friend [[Robin Scorpio|Robin Scorpio-Drake]] ([[Kimberly McCullough]]); the information confirmed Curtis, Jason and Sam's story.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Jordan Ashford==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Jordan Ashford\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = [[Vinessa Antoine]] (2014\u201318)<br> Briana Nicole Henry (2018\u2013)\n| years            = 2014\u2013\n| first            = March 17, 2014\n| last             =\n| creator          = [[Ron Carlivati]]\n| introducer       = [[Frank Valentini]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[General Hospital cast members#Main cast|Present; regular]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| occupation       = Commissioner of the Port Charles Police Department <Br> Formerly employed by the Corinthos Organization (while working undercover for [[Anna Devane]]) <br> Former Agent for the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency <br> Former Head of Distribution for the Jerome drug operation (while working undercover) <br> Former Gallery manager at the Jerome Agency <br> Former Drug dealer <br> Formerly employed at a dentist's office \n| residence        = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family           =\n| parents          =\n| adoptiveparents  =\n| stepparents      =\n| siblings         =\n| husband           = {{Plainlist|\n* Tommy Ashford (pre\u20132011)\n* [[Curtis Ashford]] (2018\u2013)\n}}\n| civilpartner     =\n| sons             = [[TJ Ashford]]\n| adoptivechildren =\n| stepchildren     =\n| grandchildren    =\n| grandparents     =\n| aunts/uncles     =\n| nieces/nephews   =\n| cousins          =\n| relatives        = Curtis Ashford\n}}\n'''Jordan Ashford''', portrayed by [[Vinessa Antoine]], was introduced on March 17, 2014, as the estranged mother of [[TJ Ashford]] ([[Tequan Richmond]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2014/03/vinessa-antoine-joins-general-hospital.html |website=[[We Love Soaps]] |title= Vinessa Antoine Joins General Hospital as Jordan|publisher=|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/vinessa-antoine-debuts-on-general-hospital/2014/03|title=Vinessa Antoine Debuts On General Hospital|last=Fairman|first=Michael|work=[[Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps]]|date=March 14, 2014|accessdate=October 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122001204/http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/vinessa-antoine-debuts-on-general-hospital/2014/03|archive-date=January 22, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> On August 10, 2018, it was announced that Briana Nicole Henry had been cast in the role of Jordan, following Antoine's casting in the Canadian pilot series, ''Diggstown''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Exclusive: GH Hires New Jordan! |url=https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/exclusive-gh-hires-new-jordan/ |accessdate=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Soap Opera Digest]] |agency=Odyssey Magazine Publishing Group Inc. |publisher=[[American Media, Inc.]] |date=August 10, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810163309/https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/exclusive-gh-hires-new-jordan/ |archivedate=August 10, 2018 |location=United States |url-status=live}}</ref> Antoine last aired on September 7, 2018.<ref name=GH090718>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); Donny Sheldon ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= September 7, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14113|language= English}}</ref> Henry made her debut on September 13, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|author=Soaps SheKnows|authorlink=Soaps.com|title=GH Jordan Recast: Briana Nicole Henry's Air Date Revealed|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/comings-and-goings/2041/gh-recast-briana-nicole-henry-in-as-jordan-ashford|website=[[Soaps.com]]|publisher=[[SheKnows Media]]|accessdate=September 8, 2018|location=United States|date=September 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Storylines===\nJordan comes to Port Charles upon learning that TJ had found himself caught in a mob war between [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]) and [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]). While TJ and his guardian, [[Shawn Butler]] ([[Sean Blakemore]]), assured Jordan that TJ was safe from Julian, Jordan still pressured her son to leave Port Charles with her. When TJ refused, Jordan decided to remain in Port Charles with her son and took a job working for the Jerome Organization at an art gallery they owned. Shawn warned Jordan to stay away from the Jeromes and when she refused, he threatened to tell TJ that the reason he had been sent to Port Charles in the first place was because she was serving a two-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. While Jordan attempted to convince Shawn that she had changed, she secretly offered to distribute drugs for Julian that he was running through town. Jordan is eventually arrested as part of a sting operation organized by the Port Charles Police Department, at which time she reveals she is working undercover with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to bring down the Jerome Organization. Jordan confides in Anna Devane of her DEA status and Anna agrees to work with her to reveal the identity of Julian Jerome's boss.\n\nIn 2014, it is revealed that Shawn and Jordan had an affair before TJ was born and that when Tommy found a letter about the DNA test proving that Tommy, not Shawn, was TJ's father, confirming Shawn and Jordan's affair, he became so enraged that he attacked Shawn. Tommy pulled a gun but before he could kill Shawn, Shawn killed him first.\n\nIn May 2015, Jordan confirmed that Shawn, not Tommy, is in fact TJ's father. In the middle of 2015, Jordan replaces [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Kyle Sloane]] as [[police commissioner]].

Finn eventually goes to rehab, but when he tests positive for drugs, Finn insists he's being set up, and Hayden believes him. She hires investigator [[Curtis Ashford]] ([[Donnell Turner]]), and is able to prove that Finn's tests were tampered with by Dr. [[Liesl Obrecht]] ([[Kathleen Gati]]). Obrecht is fired, and Finn is reinstated. While proving Finn's innocence, Hayden discovered that she was pregnant. After Finn returns to work, he proposes to Hayden, who accepts. Obrecht, furious about getting fired, aims to get revenge on Hayden and Finn. She contacts Hayden's ex-husband, Jared Preston Jr. ([[Matt Corboy]]), who reveals that Hayden was responsible for a hit-and-run while driving drunk, but he took the blame and went to prison, hoping to get paid. But Hayden's father was arrested, and she couldn't pay him. He demands payment, or he'll tell Finn. Hayden admits the truth to Finn, who decides to forgive her. Afraid of what Jared might do, Hayden skips town on the day of her and Finn's wedding, leaving behind her ring. Finn and Curtis look for her, and discover a note Hayden left for Finn, telling him not to try and find her and that their baby died. Hayden is shown to be lying, though, and leaves, still pregnant, under a new alias.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Warren Bauer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Warren Bauer\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = [[Bradley Cole]]\n| first            = March 17, 2010\n| last             = July 23, 2010\n| creator          = [[Robert Guza, Jr.]]\n| introducer       = [[Jill Farren Phelps]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[List of previous General Hospital cast members|Former; recurring]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| species          = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| breed            = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| occupation       = [[Lawyer]]\n| residence        = <!-- Or \"home\" -->\n| family           =\n| owner            = <!-- For non-humans (pets) only -->\n| parents          = <!-- Or \"father\" and \"mother\" -->\n| adoptiveparents  = <!-- Or \"adoptivefather\" and \"adoptivemother\" -->\n| stepparents      = <!-- Or \"stepfather\" and \"stepmother\" -->\n| siblings         = <!-- Or \"brothers\" and \"sisters\" -->\n| wife           = [[#Melinda Bauer|Melinda Bauer]]\n| civilpartner     =\n| sons             = [[List of General Hospital characters (2000s)#Kiefer Bauer|Kiefer Bauer]]\n| daughters = Kendra Lennon\n| adoptivechildren = <!-- Or \"adoptivesons\" and \"adoptivedaughters\" -->\n| stepchildren     = <!-- Or \"stepsons\" and \"stepdaughters\" -->\n| grandchildren    = <!-- Or \"grandsons\" and \"granddaughters\" -->\n| grandparents     = <!-- Or \"grandfathers\" and \"grandmothers\" -->\n| aunts/uncles     = <!-- Or \"uncles\" and \"aunts\" -->\n| nieces/nephews   = <!-- Or \"nephews\" and \"nieces\" -->\n| cousins          = <!-- First cousins only -->\n| relatives        = <!-- For any other relative not listed above who is essential to the understanding of the character -->\n}}\n'''Warren Bauer''', portrayed by [[Bradley Cole]], was introduced as the father of [[Kiefer Bauer]] ([[Christian Alexander]]) on March 17, 2010.\n\n===Casting===\nThe cast was announced on February 9, 2010 by Cole himself on ''[[Twitter]]''.

However, Warren refuses to blame his son and blames the enemies of Kristina's mob boss father, [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]) for the attack. Due to the ongoing investigation, Warren reminds Kiefer that he never approved of his relationship with Kristina. When Kiefer is killed in a hit and run accident, Warren believes Kristina's mother, [[Alexis Davis|Alexis]] ([[Nancy Lee Grahn]]) killed his son on purpose, and vows revenge. Warren and wife [[#Melinda Bauer|Melinda]] ([[Lisa Waltz]]) post an online memorial page portraying Kiefer as a great student and great person and openly accuse Alexis of killing their son. He also accuses [[Ethan Lovett]] ([[Nathan Parsons]]) of being Kristina's \"real\" attacker. Warren tries to guilt Kristina into falsely accusing Ethan once again by reminding her of Kiefer's love. Warren continues pressuring the police to press charges and continues attacking Kristina and Alexis in public. When Alexis is acquitted, Warren files a wrongful death suit. Warren even pressures federal prosecutor, [[#Claire Walsh|Claire Walsh]] ([[Dahlia Salem]]) to press charges against Alexis. When Warren gets too aggressive with Alexis and her daughters in public, Sonny openly accuses Warren of abusing his son. In late July, Warren attempts but fails to obtain Kristina's medical records at General Hospital and threatens to sue for obstruction of justice. Warren runs into Kristina and nearly hits her when she berates him for abusing Kiefer, forcing her brother, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] ([[Chad Duell]]), to step in. A fight ensues with Lucky pulling Michael off Warren. When police commissioner [[Mac Scorpio]] ([[John J. York]]) arrives, Warren snaps and pulls a gun, shooting Mac and Ethan.

Later, she lures Nathan to her hotel room, hoping to talk to him. Maxie, at the same time, finds out who Claudette is, and the two leave. Though Claudette says she's not after Nathan, Maxie is suspicious of her. Claudette reunites with [[Griffin Munro]] ([[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]]), the man with whom she cheated on Nathan. Griffin is not happy, though, and says he's ashamed of their affair. Claudette says that she still loves him and hopes they'll be together.

The role has been portrayed by [[Michael Easton]] since May 13, 2013.\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:MichaelEastonCrop.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|Michael Easton portrays Silas.]]\n\nFollowing the cancellation of fellow ABC daytime soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]'' in January 2012, it was announced that Michael Easton, who had portrayed the role of [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]] on the series since October 2003, would bring his character over to ''General Hospital'', after a venture to bring ''One Life to Live'' online had fallen apart. Easton had portrayed the character of McBain on ''General Hospital'' for little less than a year before it was announced that the efforts to bring ''One Life to Live'' online had begun again, and thus they were recalling the character of John McBain (as well as two other former ''One Life to Live'' characters) back to the parent series. As Easton was still under contract with ABC at this time, the decision was made to reintroduce the actors to ''General Hospital'' as brand new characters. Prior to his role on ''One Life to Live'', Easton had portrayed the role of vampire [[Caleb Morley]] on the defunct ''General Hospital'' spinoff, ''[[Port Charles]]'', from May 2001 to October 2003. In early 2013, Easton's portrayal of Morley was revisited on ''General Hospital'', with the series retconning the entire Morley identity as an alter ego of psychotic serial killer [[#Stephen Clay|Stephen Clay]]. In Easton's new role as Dr. Silas Clay, he serves as Stephen's older brother, as well as the paternal uncle of Stephen's son, [[Rafe Kovich, Jr.]], with any and all references to John McBain in the ''General Hospital'' canon eliminated. On July 29, 2015, it was confirmed that Easton would depart ''General Hospital'' in the role of Silas.<ref name=\"Silas\">{{cite web|last1=Giddens |first1=Jamey |title=Confirmed: Michael Easton Out at ''General Hospital''!

He clarifies that he's his older brother. Silas comes to Port Charles to meet his nephew, [[Rafe Kovich, Jr.]] (Jimmy Deshler), but Rafe's taken aback, because of Silas' resemblance to Stephen, and turns Silas down. Silas, though, petitions for custody of Rafe from Sam, his legal guardian. At the court hearing, he trashes Sam's image and, outraged, Sam confronts him. Instead, she finds him examining her son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Danny]]. Silas says that Danny might be sick, but Sam walks away, discounting his observation. Sam takes Danny to the hospital, where he's diagnosed with cancer. Silas chooses to stay in town and help with Danny's care, giving up his petition for custody of Rafe. During Danny's treatment, he and Sam grow closer.\n\nSilas later encounters [[Ava Jerome]] ([[Maura West]]), his old flame, and her daughter, [[Kiki Jerome|Kiki]] ([[Kristen Alderson]]). Though Ava denies it initially, Silas later finds out that Kiki is his daughter. He and Kiki start to bond, and Silas starts dating Sam. When Detective [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]] ([[Ryan Paevey]]) starts questioning Silas about a cold case, Sam finds out that Silas is married. Silas admits it, and reveals that his wife, [[Nina Reeves|Nina]], has been in a coma for 20 years. He blames himself, because he was having an affair with Ava, and believes she attempted suicide when she found out. However, he finds out Nathan suspects Silas tried to kill her. Sam helps prove his innocence by revealing that Nina's mother, [[Madeline Reeves]] ([[Donna Mills]]), was the one responsible. Nina ([[Michelle Stafford]]) returns soon after, waking up from her coma. She moves in with Silas, who takes care of her, but still dates Sam. Though Nina insists she's fine with Silas moving on, Sam is suspicious.\n\nWhen Rafe dies in a car accident, Silas is devastated, and accuses [[Patrick Drake]] ([[Jason Thompson (actor)|Jason Thompson]]), Rafe's doctor, of intentionally killing him since Rafe caused an accident that killed Patrick's [[Children of General Hospital#Gabriel Santiago|son]]. Sam, though, defends Patrick, and she and Silas break up. Silas realizes that Patrick did not kill Rafe, but also finds out Nina intentionally sabotaged his relationship with Sam as revenge for him sleeping with Ava.\n\nHaving lost Sam for good, Silas helps out Kiki and Ava, who is in hiding after committing murder. When Nina steals Ava's newborn daughter, [[Avery Corinthos|Avery]], Silas helps Kiki bring Avery home. Ava is sent to prison, and Silas helps Kiki take care of Avery. When Ava escapes from prison, she is presumed dead after being shot. However, Silas saves her, and hides her in a facility, where he reveals she's dying of cancer. Though Ava is ready to die, Silas saves her by kidnapping Avery, and taking her bone marrow to save Ava's life. Ava returns to Port Charles under an alias, hoping to get close to Avery. Though Silas knows the truth, she blackmails him with Avery's kidnapping to stay silent. Soon after, Silas is found dead. His killer is revealed to be Madeline, who killed Silas to get her hands on Nina's inheritance.<ref name=\"Silas\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/general-hospital-murder-mystery-month-kiki-jerome-dr-silas-clay-killer/81237|accessdate=March 13, 2016|date=August 6, 2015|title='General Hospital' Murder Mystery to Last Only a Month; Kiki Jerome Dr. Silas Clay Killer|work=Movie News Guide|location=United States|first=Martin|last=Suan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313121840/http://www.movienewsguide.com/general-hospital-murder-mystery-month-kiki-jerome-dr-silas-clay-killer/81237|archive-date=March 13, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=General Hospital: Silas Is Murdered!

The character is an adaptation of the fictional vampire character [[Caleb Morley]], originated by Easton on the ''General Hospital'' spin-off ''Port Charles'' from 2001\u20132003.  When Caleb was killed at the end of \"Tempted,\" he eventually returned during the story arc \"Naked Eyes,\" this time in the guise of the vampire rock star \"Stephen Clay.\" Caleb Morley aka Stephen Clay remained a fan favorite and primary character until the cancellation of ''Port Charles'' in October 2003. Easton joined the cast of ''One Life to Live'', where he played the role of John McBain until its cancellation in January 2012 and then brought the character of McBain to ''General Hospital''. In 2013, writers decided to revisit Caleb's storyline from ''Port Charles'' and adapt it into the ''General Hospital'' storylines.\n\n===Storylines===\n[[File:MichaelEastonCrop.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|Michael Easton plays Stephen.]]\nIn January 2013, [[Lucy Coe]], having recently returned to Port Charles after a ten-year absence, has a run-in with Detective John McBain. Lucy claims McBain is a vampire named Caleb Morley, and attempts to stake him in the chest. She is arrested and eventually sent to Ferncliff [[sanatorium]]. In the wake of her hospitalization, her estranged husband [[Kevin Collins (General Hospital)|Kevin Collins]] returns, stating Lucy's claims of Caleb's existence are merely a psychotic delusion. Meanwhile, Alison Barrington returns to Port Charles, with her teenage son, Rafe Kovich, Jr. Alison also mistakes McBain for Caleb, prompting her to flee. Alison is confronted by Caleb, who kills her. McBain arrives and finds a visibly shaken Rafe holding the murder weapon. Rafe is detained as the primary suspect, and when questioned by Police Commissioner [[Anna Devane]], claims McBain murdered his mother. Meanwhile, Lucy, having learned of Alison's murder, stages a breakout from Ferncliff, with the assistance of [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]] and [[Todd Manning]], determined to protect Rafe.\n\nMeanwhile, Caleb poses as McBain and removes Rafe from police custody. He kills a police officer and tries to take Rafe out of Port Charles, but Rafe runs away. He visits a professor at Port Charles University and kills him when he reveals he knows about Caleb. While he's there, [[Sam Morgan (General Hospital)|Sam Morgan]] comes to PCU looking for the professor. Caleb becomes fixated on her, believing she's [[Livvie Locke]], his former wife. Caleb goes to the pier, where Heather is with Sam's son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Danny]]. Caleb chokes Heather and throws her into the water. He tries to take Danny but Todd stops him. After the police leave, he finds Sam and Danny on the pier and kidnaps them. Meanwhile, John, Lucy, and Rafe break out of police custody to try to save Sam and Danny. John heads to PCU, and finds out \"Caleb\" is actually Stephen Clay, a former rock musician who went insane after the death of his wife, Livvie. Clay played the persona of a vampire onstage and, after his wife died, he believed he was an actual vampire and went on a killing spree before being arrested and thrown into a mental institution he escaped from. Meanwhile, \"Caleb\" takes Sam and Danny to Wyndemere, telling Sam they'll be reunited once he bites her three times. John, Lucy, and Rafe arrive to find Danny alone. \"Caleb\" ties Sam up in the tunnels but eventually John and Lucy arrive and kill him. Later, Lucy views Stephen's body at the morgue she notices the ring is missing, when Anna gets Lucy out of the morgue. It is revealed the morgue attendant had the ring and when he tries it on, the young attendant is seen lying dead as the figure walks off meaning there really wasn't a Stephen Clay, but Caleb Morley, the vampire, again using his former alias.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Brad Cooper==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Brad Cooper\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = {{Plainlist |\n* Unknown actor (2013)\n* [[Parry Shen]] (2013\u2013)\n}}\n| years            = 2013\u2013\n| first            = February 13, 2013\n| last             =\n| creator          = [[Ron Carlivati]]\n| introducer       = [[Frank Valentini]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[List of General Hospital cast members#Recurring cast|Present; recurring]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| occupation       = Lab technician \n| residence        = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family           =\n| father           = [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Kim Soong Wu]]\n| adoptiveparents  = \n| stepparents      = \n| siblings         = \n| spouse = {{Plainlist |\n* Rosalie Martinez (divorced)\n* [[Lucas Jones]] (2016\u2013)\n}}\n| civilpartner     =\n| adoptivesons = {{Plainlist|\n* Wylie Cooper-Jones \n* [[Children of General Hospital#Jonah Corinthos|Jonah Corinthos]] (illegal)<ref name=GH072618>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); [[Scott McKinsey]] ([[Television director|Director]]); Suzanne Flynn ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 26, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14087|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH073018>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); Denise Van Cleve ([[Television director|Director]]); Kate Hall ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 30, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14089|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH073118>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); [[Elizabeth Korte]] ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 31, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14090|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH080218>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); Charlotte Gibson ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= August 2, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14092|language= English}}</ref>\n}}\n| adoptivechildren = \n| stepchildren     = \n| grandchildren    = \n| grandparents     = \n| aunts            = [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Jade Soong]]\n| nieces/nephews   = \n| cousins          = \n| relatives        = [[List of General Hospital characters#W|Mr. Wu]]\n}}\n'''Bradley \"Brad\" Cooper''' was introduced to the series on February 13, 2013, played by an unknown actor.

Trey is the producer of Kristina's reality television show ''Mob Princess'', and manipulates her into continuing the show despite her family's disapproval. Trey immediately clashes with Kristina's parents, [[Alexis Davis]] and mob boss Sonny Corinthos. He convinces Sonny to agree to the reality show while keeping his mysterious boss up-to-date on the project. Trey moves into his new apartment and clashes with his roommate, [[Starr Manning]]. Meanwhile, Kristina's brother, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] accuses Trey of manipulating and using both Kristina and Starr, though he denies it. Trey continues to make enemies when it comes to Starr's father, [[Todd Manning|Todd]], while he is oblivious to the fact that Kristina has a crush on him. Meanwhile, Trey bashes Sonny's girlfriend [[Kate Howard]] when it is revealed that her alternate personality caused the car accident killing Starr's family. Meanwhile, Kristina reveals her true feelings for Trey and they share their first kiss in July 2012; however, Trey is hesitant about getting involved with her fearing it will interfere with the show. It is soon revealed that Trey is actually the son of Sonny's longtime nemesis [[#Joe Scully, Jr.|Joe Scully Jr]], who is financing the show. Kristina continues her flirtatious behavior while Trey becomes determined to catch Sonny doing something illegal on camera. Trey is shocked to find his father in prison in [[Atlantic City]]. Joe admits that his father Joe Sr. was a mobster that Sonny used to work for, and convinces Trey to keep his true identity a secret so they can get revenge on Sonny for framing him for murder. He also coerces Trey into ending the reality show and romancing Kristina. In late August, Joe coerces Trey into eloping with Kristina [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Trey leads Kristina to believe that they have to get married for the show so he won't be sued. In September 2012, Trey has a confrontation with Kate, who recognizes a medal that he was wearing as being identical to one that Joe wore the night he raped her, leading her to realize that Trey is the son she conceived as the result of the rape. This revelation prompts Kate's alter, Connie, to emerge, and she proceeds to tell Trey that she wished he had never been born. In October 2012, Joe abducts Kristina on orders from [[Cesar Faison]], who intends to have Joe kill her in an convoluted effort to gain control of Sonny's assets. Trey attempts to wrestle the gun away from Joe, but inadvertently ends up shooting him the shoulder, resulting in Joe fleeing the scene before he can fulfill Faison's orders. Subsequently, Trey's connection to Joe is revealed, prompting Kristina to end her marriage to him, and Trey is evicted from the apartment he shared with [[Starr Manning]] by its original owner, [[Maxie Jones]]. Trey spends the next few months living at the local church, all the while attempting to aid Sonny in his quest to have Connie committed to Shadybrook Sanitarium, which ultimately fails. As time goes on, Trey and Kristina reconcile, and plan to relocate to California. However, their plans are derailed when, on New Year's Eve, they are involved in a car accident, which causes an aneurysm in Trey's brain to rupture, rendering him brain dead on January 8, 2013.

When the two teenagers began dating, Josslyn's mother, Carly Corinthos ([[Laura Wright]]) became eager to meet Kim, which Oscar kept delaying due to Kim's long working hours. However, when Carly invited Kim to Thanksgiving dinner, she eagerly accepted the invitation. At the dinner, Kim met [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason Morgan]] ([[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]]), who she recognized as Andrew Cain. Carly explained that Jason was Drew's twin brother, and that the two had been separated at birth. With Carly eager to know what Kim knew about Drew, who had been rendered amnesiac and had required facial reconstruction surgery due to injuries sustained in an auto accident, Kim explained she had casually dated Drew for a short time in San Diego. After Drew, who was a Navy SEAL, was redeployed, Kim discovered she was pregnant with Oscar and attempted to contact him, but was told that he deserted and eventually stopped looking for him. Years later, Kim had attempted to run Oscar's DNA through an ancestry site in order to locate Drew or any of his family due to Oscar's curiosity about his father. It was at this point that Kim learned that Oscar had family living in Port Charles, so she and Oscar relocated in order to find Drew and his family. Shocked to discover that Oscar was Quartermaine following her move from Mercy Hospital to General Hospital, Kim was greeted warmly by chief of staff [[Monica Quartermaine|Dr. Monica Quartermaine]] ([[Leslie Charleson]]), Oscar's grandmother. Despite having no memory of his relationship with Kim, Drew ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) was eager to build a relationship with Oscar. In an effort to spark some memory of his past, Kim gave Drew a CD of music that he had made for her before he left San Diego, for which he was grateful. With no indication that Drew recalled their past or harbored any romantic feelings towards her, Kim focused on her role at General Hospital and struck up a friendship with [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]), which later turned into a romantic relationship. In September 2018, Oscar was revealed to be dying of an inoperable Grade IV Glioblastoma, which had Kim had been aware of for two years without telling him. Oscar was furious with his mother for lying to him and began to drift toward a cult led by Hank \"Shiloh\" Archer (Coby Ryan McLaughlin), but never became substantially involved with them. On New Years, Kim kissed Drew, and in his anger Julian ended his relationship with her, even going so far to lie about sleeping with someone else. After some time, Kim and Julian were able to reconcile their relationship. In March 2019, Dr. Terry Randolph (Cassandra James) informed Kim, Drew and Oscar that the Glioblastoma had advanced, and Oscar had only six months to live. On April 29, 2019, three and half weeks after experiencing a severe seizure, Oscar died surrounded by Josslyn, Kim and Drew at the Quartermaine Mansion. Oscar was cremated and honoring his wishes, a devastated Kim and Drew climbed to the summit of Kilimanjaro and scattered his ashes there. In her grief, Kim began to spiral out of control, becoming obsessed with having another baby. After failing to convince Julian to conceive a child with her, she drugged and attempted to rape Drew at the wedding reception for [[Franco Baldwin]] ([[Roger Howarth]]) and [[Elizabeth Webber]] ([[Rebecca Herbst]]) as an alternative. Julian, recognizing that Kim was losing control, was able to stop her and after waking up and realizing what had happened, Drew opted not to press charges against her. In August 2019, a flash drive containing Drew's memories prior to arriving in Port Charles was stolen by Shiloh, who had kidnapped [[Cameron Webber]] ([[William Lipton]]) and attempted to implant them into his brain. Having been discovered by Franco, he opted to take Cameron's place in the experiment, and once he woke up, firmly believed himself to be Drew Cain. After running into Kim at General Hospital, Franco began relaying memories of Drew's past with Kim to her as if he himself had lived them. Distressed and demanding answers as to what was going, Elizabeth and the real Drew explained everything to her. Shortly thereafter, Drew left Port Charles in an effort to locate Dr. Andre Maddox ([[Anthony Montgomery]]), who he believed stood the best chance of restoring Franco to his former self. When Drew was declared dead after his plane has crashed, Kim began to fall in love with Franco and became convinced that she had a second shot at the relationship she had missed out on years earlier with Drew. Desperate for a future with \"Drew\" free of his ties to all of Franco's loved ones, Kim sought help from attorney Martin Gray ([[Michael E. Knight]]) in an effort to grant Franco the right to live his life as Drew Cain. As their relationship deepened, the two made plans to leave Port Charles and begin their life together. Following a conversation with [[Scott Baldwin]] ([[Kin Shriner]]), who explained to \"Drew\" that Franco had protected him from sexual predator Jim Harvey as a child, \"Drew\" informed Kim that he couldn't leave with her, and that he owed it to Franco to try to give him his life back, effectively ending their relationship.

He believes that Nina overdosed when she found out about his affair with [[Ava Jerome]], and has been in a coma for 20 years. However, Nina's brother, Detective [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]], believes Silas tried to kill her, and investigates the case. He finds out that it was actually Nina's mother [[Madeline Reeves]], who tried to kill Nina, because Nina was pregnant with Silas' child. She wanted to get rid of Nina's baby, and accidentally put her own daughter in a coma. Madeline tells Nathan that Nina has died, but later says that she only had Nina declared dead to get the inheritance that was left to Nina by Madeline's late husband.\n\nNina first appears onscreen in May 2014, waking up from her coma. Roughly a month later, Nina arrives in Port Charles, and shocks a bewildered Silas with her presence. Both Silas and Nathan are happy that she's alive, but Nina soon has to find out that much has changed. She is introduced to [[Kiki Jerome]], Silas' daughter with Ava. Silas is also now dating [[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]], despite Nina still showing an interest in him. After first not being aware that Silas and Sam are a couple, Nina claims to be fine with it; accepting the end of her marriage; and tells Silas that it would only be natural for his life to go on. However it is later revealed that Nina has been awake for longer than she says and that she trashed Silas' apartment a few months back. Nina in fact wants revenge on everyone that wronged her. Nina married [[Ric Lansing]] on May 18, 2015.\n\nIn November 2015, Nina goes to [[Julian Jerome]], who owns ''Crimson'' magazine under his media empire, for a job. She ends up getting the job of [[editor-in-chief]] since the former had left the magazine. She works closely with [[Maxie Jones]]. When Nina and Maxie need someone to take pictures for the Nutcracker Gala, Maxie has an idea that [[Dillon Quartermaine]] (Robert Palmer Watkins) should stay in town, work for Nina, and take pictures of everyone at the Gala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/general-hospital-previews-their-nutcracker-gala-with-first-look-photos/2015/12/06/|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 6, 2015|work=Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=General Hospital Previews Their Nutcracker Gala With First Look Photos!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghdailydish.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-nutcracker-gala.html|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 21, 2015|work=GH Daily Blog|title=The Nutcracker Gala}}</ref> In October 2018, a DNA test is arranged by Valentin (James Patrick Stuart) and confirms that Sasha Gilmore is Nina's daughter; however, it is later revealed that Valentin hired her to pretend to be her daughter.

Though she rejects him, Carlos plants seeds of doubt in her about Patrick's devotion because he is still wearing his wedding ring. Carlos is eventually revealed to be the mob enforcer for [[Julian Jerome]]. Days before Patrick and Sabrina's wedding, Carlos sees Robin Scorpio, Patrick's presumed dead wife and Sonny's presumed dead friend alive. He tells Sabrina, but she refuses to believe him. Carlos is later kidnapped by rival mob boss Sonny Corinthos, and lies about claiming to be the brother of Sonny's late [[Lily Corinthos|Lily]] (Lilly Melgar) hoping it will keep him alive. However, it is revealed that Carlos is lying, but before Sonny's henchman, [[Shawn Butler]] can kill him, Carlos escapes with help from [[TJ Ashford]]. Carlos is shot during a shootout, and makes his way to Sabrina's. When Sabrina learns she is pregnant, Carlos claims to be the father despite knowing the child is Patrick's. Sabrina tells the truth to Patrick about him being the child's father and not Carlos. Carlos is then arrested for the murder of [[AJ Quartermaine]]. [[Ava Jerome]] visits him and threatens him if he babbles the truth about AJ then she will hurt Sabrina. So for Sabrina's sake, he pleads guilty. When Sabrina visits him in jail, he lies to her that he killed AJ and that he was lying to her all this time. Unable to bear the pain, Sabrina leaves. Months later, Sabrina visits Carlos in jail to fill him in on how she found out the truth, indicating that she is no longer upset with him. In May 2015, Carlos kills [[Duke Lavery]] by delivering a fatal gunshot wound to his abdomen. In retaliation, Carlos is killed by Anna Devane on the docks of the Port Charles Harbor. In late November 2015, Carlos shows up at Sabrina's door. Apparently, Rivera had not died. He sees that Sabrina is pregnant and thinks the baby is his. At first she denies it, but when he overhears a private conversation between Felix and her, he realizes that the baby is his and not the child of [[Michael Corinthos]], Sabrina's boyfriend. Sabrina still wants to keep the secret, feeling Carlos is dangerous to be around. However, when Michael finds out the truth, he leaves Sabrina, and she decides to go on the run with Carlos. Their son is born while they are fugitives, and they run with the help of [[Paul Hornsby]]. Carlos is found by Sonny and Anna in Colombia, and they bring him back to Port Charles to stand trial for murdering Duke. However, Carlos threatens Paul to help him escape. Carlos manages to escape from the prisoner transport van, and calls Julian for help to find a way out of town. Julian, though, stabs Carlos and throws him into the harbor. He's found by Michael, who brings him to the hospital, where Carlos succumbs to his injuries.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Aaron Roland==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Aaron Roland\n| series         = General Hospital\n| portrayer      = [[John DeLuca]]\n| creator        = [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Jean Passanante]]\n| years     = 2016\n| first          = April 27, 2016\n| last = August 11, 2016\n| classification = [[List of previous General Hospital cast members|Former; recurring]]\n| occupation     = Manager of ''Perks Coffee'' (2016\u2013)\n}}\n'''Aaron Roland''', played by [[John DeLuca]], was introduced in April 2016 and departed in August 2016.

Sonny and Brenda confront Suzanne about her schemes and she claims she is worried Sonny's enemies will target Brenda. It is then revealed that Suzanne is actually married to the Balkan, aka Theo Hoffman. The duo want Brenda to answer for their son, Aleksander's death in 2007. After Theo kidnaps Brenda with the help of [[Shawn Butler]] ([[Sean Blakemore]]), it is revealed that Brenda gave birth to Aleksander's stillborn son with Suzanne by her side. Theo immediately assumes the child lived as it was Suzanne who witnessed the birth. Though denying Theo's accusations, she harbors resentment toward her husband for allowing their son into the criminal life. During Theo's search for their grandson, Suzanne kills him. Suzanne continues to raise her grandson in secret, but to keep Brenda and Sonny from finding him, she presents Brenda with another little boy named Lucian, and pretends he is the child. When Sonny demands a DNA test, Suzanne kidnaps the boy and skips town. Fortunately, Suzanne is found in [[San Antonio]] with Brenda's biological son, Alec.

Curtis is soon revealed to be the brother-in-law of Police Commissioner [[Jordan Ashford]] ([[Vinessa Antoine]]) and uncle of her son, [[TJ Ashford|TJ]] ([[Tequan Richmond]]). Jordan is not happy to see Curtis, and demands that he leave town. Curtis becomes attracted to [[Valerie Spencer]] ([[Brytni Sarpy]]), an officer in training. Jordan tries to warn Valerie away from Curtis. Curtis reveals that he had a cocaine addiction, and Jordan later states that it led to him losing his job as a DEA agent. Curtis starts dating Valerie, and starts getting to know TJ. Curtis reveals that he told his brother, Tommy, that TJ was actually Shawn's son. Curtis admits to Jordan that he regrets what he did, but overhears, and is furious with his mother for lying to him. He also talks to Curtis, who convinces TJ to give Jordan another chance. Curtis tries to convince Jordan to give him a job as an officer, saying that he's changed, but Jordan has a hard time trusting him. Curtis is hired by [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]) to find who planted a bomb in his car, which ended up killing [[Morgan Corinthos]] ([[Bryan Craig]]). Curtis suspects [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]), Morgan's father and Julian's rival. When Curtis goes behind Valerie's back to get evidence, Valerie breaks up with him. However, Curtis later realizes someone else is involved. When he starts tracking down his lead, Julian abruptly fires him. Curtis is left suspicious, and continues to investigate.

When TJ refused, Jordan decided to remain in Port Charles with her son and took a job working for the Jerome Organization at an art gallery they owned. Shawn warned Jordan to stay away from the Jeromes and when she refused, he threatened to tell TJ that the reason he had been sent to Port Charles in the first place was because she was serving a two-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. While Jordan attempted to convince Shawn that she had changed, she secretly offered to distribute drugs for Julian that he was running through town. Jordan is eventually arrested as part of a sting operation organized by the Port Charles Police Department, at which time she reveals she is working undercover with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to bring down the Jerome Organization.

Hayden is accidentally infected from one of his experiments, and also falls ill. She and Elizabeth start making amends when Elizabeth shows concern for her. Finn is eventually able to find a cure, saving him and Hayden.\n\nFinn and Hayden start a relationship, until Hayden figures out that he's an addict. Finn eventually goes to rehab, but when he tests positive for drugs, Finn insists he's being set up, and Hayden believes him. She hires investigator [[Curtis Ashford]] ([[Donnell Turner]]), and is able to prove that Finn's tests were tampered with by Dr. [[Liesl Obrecht]] ([[Kathleen Gati]]). Obrecht is fired, and Finn is reinstated. While proving Finn's innocence, Hayden discovered that she was pregnant. After Finn returns to work, he proposes to Hayden, who accepts. Obrecht, furious about getting fired, aims to get revenge on Hayden and Finn. She contacts Hayden's ex-husband, Jared Preston Jr. ([[Matt Corboy]]), who reveals that Hayden was responsible for a hit-and-run while driving drunk, but he took the blame and went to prison, hoping to get paid. But Hayden's father was arrested, and she couldn't pay him. He demands payment, or he'll tell Finn. Hayden admits the truth to Finn, who decides to forgive her. Afraid of what Jared might do, Hayden skips town on the day of her and Finn's wedding, leaving behind her ring. Finn and Curtis look for her, and discover a note Hayden left for Finn, telling him not to try and find her and that their baby died. Hayden is shown to be lying, though, and leaves, still pregnant, under a new alias.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Warren Bauer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Warren Bauer\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = [[Bradley Cole]]\n| first            = March 17, 2010\n| last             = July 23, 2010\n| creator          = [[Robert Guza, Jr.]]\n| introducer       = [[Jill Farren Phelps]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[List of previous General Hospital cast members|Former; recurring]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| species          = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| breed            = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| occupation       = [[Lawyer]]\n| residence        = <!-- Or \"home\" -->\n| family           =\n| owner            = <!-- For non-humans (pets) only -->\n| parents          = <!-- Or \"father\" and \"mother\" -->\n| adoptiveparents  = <!-- Or \"adoptivefather\" and \"adoptivemother\" -->\n| stepparents      = <!-- Or \"stepfather\" and \"stepmother\" -->\n| siblings         = <!-- Or \"brothers\" and \"sisters\" -->\n| wife           = [[#Melinda Bauer|Melinda Bauer]]\n| civilpartner     =\n| sons             = [[List of General Hospital characters (2000s)#Kiefer Bauer|Kiefer Bauer]]\n| daughters = Kendra Lennon\n| adoptivechildren = <!-- Or \"adoptivesons\" and \"adoptivedaughters\" -->\n| stepchildren     = <!-- Or \"stepsons\" and \"stepdaughters\" -->\n| grandchildren    = <!-- Or \"grandsons\" and \"granddaughters\" -->\n| grandparents     = <!-- Or \"grandfathers\" and \"grandmothers\" -->\n| aunts/uncles     = <!-- Or \"uncles\" and \"aunts\" -->\n| nieces/nephews   = <!-- Or \"nephews\" and \"nieces\" -->\n| cousins          = <!-- First cousins only -->\n| relatives        = <!-- For any other relative not listed above who is essential to the understanding of the character -->\n}}\n'''Warren Bauer''', portrayed by [[Bradley Cole]], was introduced as the father of [[Kiefer Bauer]] ([[Christian Alexander]]) on March 17, 2010.\n\n===Casting===\nThe cast was announced on February 9, 2010 by Cole himself on ''[[Twitter]]''.

However, Warren refuses to blame his son and blames the enemies of Kristina's mob boss father, [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]) for the attack. Due to the ongoing investigation, Warren reminds Kiefer that he never approved of his relationship with Kristina. When Kiefer is killed in a hit and run accident, Warren believes Kristina's mother, [[Alexis Davis|Alexis]] ([[Nancy Lee Grahn]]) killed his son on purpose, and vows revenge. Warren and wife [[#Melinda Bauer|Melinda]] ([[Lisa Waltz]]) post an online memorial page portraying Kiefer as a great student and great person and openly accuse Alexis of killing their son. He also accuses [[Ethan Lovett]] ([[Nathan Parsons]]) of being Kristina's \"real\" attacker. Warren tries to guilt Kristina into falsely accusing Ethan once again by reminding her of Kiefer's love. Warren continues pressuring the police to press charges and continues attacking Kristina and Alexis in public. When Alexis is acquitted, Warren files a wrongful death suit. Warren even pressures federal prosecutor, [[#Claire Walsh|Claire Walsh]] ([[Dahlia Salem]]) to press charges against Alexis. When Warren gets too aggressive with Alexis and her daughters in public, Sonny openly accuses Warren of abusing his son. In late July, Warren attempts but fails to obtain Kristina's medical records at General Hospital and threatens to sue for obstruction of justice. Warren runs into Kristina and nearly hits her when she berates him for abusing Kiefer, forcing her brother, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] ([[Chad Duell]]), to step in. A fight ensues with Lucky pulling Michael off Warren. When police commissioner [[Mac Scorpio]] ([[John J. York]]) arrives, Warren snaps and pulls a gun, shooting Mac and Ethan.

Later, she lures Nathan to her hotel room, hoping to talk to him. Maxie, at the same time, finds out who Claudette is, and the two leave. Though Claudette says she's not after Nathan, Maxie is suspicious of her. Claudette reunites with [[Griffin Munro]] ([[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]]), the man with whom she cheated on Nathan. Griffin is not happy, though, and says he's ashamed of their affair. Claudette says that she still loves him and hopes they'll be together.

The role has been portrayed by [[Michael Easton]] since May 13, 2013.\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:MichaelEastonCrop.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|Michael Easton portrays Silas.]]\n\nFollowing the cancellation of fellow ABC daytime soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]'' in January 2012, it was announced that Michael Easton, who had portrayed the role of [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]] on the series since October 2003, would bring his character over to ''General Hospital'', after a venture to bring ''One Life to Live'' online had fallen apart. Easton had portrayed the character of McBain on ''General Hospital'' for little less than a year before it was announced that the efforts to bring ''One Life to Live'' online had begun again, and thus they were recalling the character of John McBain (as well as two other former ''One Life to Live'' characters) back to the parent series. As Easton was still under contract with ABC at this time, the decision was made to reintroduce the actors to ''General Hospital'' as brand new characters. Prior to his role on ''One Life to Live'', Easton had portrayed the role of vampire [[Caleb Morley]] on the defunct ''General Hospital'' spinoff, ''[[Port Charles]]'', from May 2001 to October 2003. In early 2013, Easton's portrayal of Morley was revisited on ''General Hospital'', with the series retconning the entire Morley identity as an alter ego of psychotic serial killer [[#Stephen Clay|Stephen Clay]]. In Easton's new role as Dr. Silas Clay, he serves as Stephen's older brother, as well as the paternal uncle of Stephen's son, [[Rafe Kovich, Jr.]], with any and all references to John McBain in the ''General Hospital'' canon eliminated. On July 29, 2015, it was confirmed that Easton would depart ''General Hospital'' in the role of Silas.<ref name=\"Silas\">{{cite web|last1=Giddens |first1=Jamey |title=Confirmed: Michael Easton Out at ''General Hospital''!

He clarifies that he's his older brother. Silas comes to Port Charles to meet his nephew, [[Rafe Kovich, Jr.]] (Jimmy Deshler), but Rafe's taken aback, because of Silas' resemblance to Stephen, and turns Silas down. Silas, though, petitions for custody of Rafe from Sam, his legal guardian. At the court hearing, he trashes Sam's image and, outraged, Sam confronts him. Instead, she finds him examining her son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Danny]]. Silas says that Danny might be sick, but Sam walks away, discounting his observation. Sam takes Danny to the hospital, where he's diagnosed with cancer. Silas chooses to stay in town and help with Danny's care, giving up his petition for custody of Rafe. During Danny's treatment, he and Sam grow closer.\n\nSilas later encounters [[Ava Jerome]] ([[Maura West]]), his old flame, and her daughter, [[Kiki Jerome|Kiki]] ([[Kristen Alderson]]). Though Ava denies it initially, Silas later finds out that Kiki is his daughter. He and Kiki start to bond, and Silas starts dating Sam. When Detective [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]] ([[Ryan Paevey]]) starts questioning Silas about a cold case, Sam finds out that Silas is married. Silas admits it, and reveals that his wife, [[Nina Reeves|Nina]], has been in a coma for 20 years. He blames himself, because he was having an affair with Ava, and believes she attempted suicide when she found out. However, he finds out Nathan suspects Silas tried to kill her. Sam helps prove his innocence by revealing that Nina's mother, [[Madeline Reeves]] ([[Donna Mills]]), was the one responsible. Nina ([[Michelle Stafford]]) returns soon after, waking up from her coma. She moves in with Silas, who takes care of her, but still dates Sam. Though Nina insists she's fine with Silas moving on, Sam is suspicious.\n\nWhen Rafe dies in a car accident, Silas is devastated, and accuses [[Patrick Drake]] ([[Jason Thompson (actor)|Jason Thompson]]), Rafe's doctor, of intentionally killing him since Rafe caused an accident that killed Patrick's [[Children of General Hospital#Gabriel Santiago|son]]. Sam, though, defends Patrick, and she and Silas break up. Silas realizes that Patrick did not kill Rafe, but also finds out Nina intentionally sabotaged his relationship with Sam as revenge for him sleeping with Ava.\n\nHaving lost Sam for good, Silas helps out Kiki and Ava, who is in hiding after committing murder. When Nina steals Ava's newborn daughter, [[Avery Corinthos|Avery]], Silas helps Kiki bring Avery home. Ava is sent to prison, and Silas helps Kiki take care of Avery. When Ava escapes from prison, she is presumed dead after being shot. However, Silas saves her, and hides her in a facility, where he reveals she's dying of cancer. Though Ava is ready to die, Silas saves her by kidnapping Avery, and taking her bone marrow to save Ava's life. Ava returns to Port Charles under an alias, hoping to get close to Avery. Though Silas knows the truth, she blackmails him with Avery's kidnapping to stay silent. Soon after, Silas is found dead. His killer is revealed to be Madeline, who killed Silas to get her hands on Nina's inheritance.<ref name=\"Silas\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/general-hospital-murder-mystery-month-kiki-jerome-dr-silas-clay-killer/81237|accessdate=March 13, 2016|date=August 6, 2015|title='General Hospital' Murder Mystery to Last Only a Month; Kiki Jerome Dr. Silas Clay Killer|work=Movie News Guide|location=United States|first=Martin|last=Suan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313121840/http://www.movienewsguide.com/general-hospital-murder-mystery-month-kiki-jerome-dr-silas-clay-killer/81237|archive-date=March 13, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=General Hospital: Silas Is Murdered!

The character is an adaptation of the fictional vampire character [[Caleb Morley]], originated by Easton on the ''General Hospital'' spin-off ''Port Charles'' from 2001\u20132003.  When Caleb was killed at the end of \"Tempted,\" he eventually returned during the story arc \"Naked Eyes,\" this time in the guise of the vampire rock star \"Stephen Clay.\" Caleb Morley aka Stephen Clay remained a fan favorite and primary character until the cancellation of ''Port Charles'' in October 2003. Easton joined the cast of ''One Life to Live'', where he played the role of John McBain until its cancellation in January 2012 and then brought the character of McBain to ''General Hospital''. In 2013, writers decided to revisit Caleb's storyline from ''Port Charles'' and adapt it into the ''General Hospital'' storylines.\n\n===Storylines===\n[[File:MichaelEastonCrop.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|Michael Easton plays Stephen.]]\nIn January 2013, [[Lucy Coe]], having recently returned to Port Charles after a ten-year absence, has a run-in with Detective John McBain. Lucy claims McBain is a vampire named Caleb Morley, and attempts to stake him in the chest. She is arrested and eventually sent to Ferncliff [[sanatorium]]. In the wake of her hospitalization, her estranged husband [[Kevin Collins (General Hospital)|Kevin Collins]] returns, stating Lucy's claims of Caleb's existence are merely a psychotic delusion. Meanwhile, Alison Barrington returns to Port Charles, with her teenage son, Rafe Kovich, Jr. Alison also mistakes McBain for Caleb, prompting her to flee. Alison is confronted by Caleb, who kills her. McBain arrives and finds a visibly shaken Rafe holding the murder weapon. Rafe is detained as the primary suspect, and when questioned by Police Commissioner [[Anna Devane]], claims McBain murdered his mother. Meanwhile, Lucy, having learned of Alison's murder, stages a breakout from Ferncliff, with the assistance of [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]] and [[Todd Manning]], determined to protect Rafe.\n\nMeanwhile, Caleb poses as McBain and removes Rafe from police custody. He kills a police officer and tries to take Rafe out of Port Charles, but Rafe runs away. He visits a professor at Port Charles University and kills him when he reveals he knows about Caleb. While he's there, [[Sam Morgan (General Hospital)|Sam Morgan]] comes to PCU looking for the professor. Caleb becomes fixated on her, believing she's [[Livvie Locke]], his former wife. Caleb goes to the pier, where Heather is with Sam's son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Danny]]. Caleb chokes Heather and throws her into the water. He tries to take Danny but Todd stops him. After the police leave, he finds Sam and Danny on the pier and kidnaps them. Meanwhile, John, Lucy, and Rafe break out of police custody to try to save Sam and Danny. John heads to PCU, and finds out \"Caleb\" is actually Stephen Clay, a former rock musician who went insane after the death of his wife, Livvie. Clay played the persona of a vampire onstage and, after his wife died, he believed he was an actual vampire and went on a killing spree before being arrested and thrown into a mental institution he escaped from. Meanwhile, \"Caleb\" takes Sam and Danny to Wyndemere, telling Sam they'll be reunited once he bites her three times. John, Lucy, and Rafe arrive to find Danny alone. \"Caleb\" ties Sam up in the tunnels but eventually John and Lucy arrive and kill him. Later, Lucy views Stephen's body at the morgue she notices the ring is missing, when Anna gets Lucy out of the morgue. It is revealed the morgue attendant had the ring and when he tries it on, the young attendant is seen lying dead as the figure walks off meaning there really wasn't a Stephen Clay, but Caleb Morley, the vampire, again using his former alias.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Brad Cooper==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Brad Cooper\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = {{Plainlist |\n* Unknown actor (2013)\n* [[Parry Shen]] (2013\u2013)\n}}\n| years            = 2013\u2013\n| first            = February 13, 2013\n| last             =\n| creator          = [[Ron Carlivati]]\n| introducer       = [[Frank Valentini]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[List of General Hospital cast members#Recurring cast|Present; recurring]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| occupation       = Lab technician \n| residence        = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family           =\n| father           = [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Kim Soong Wu]]\n| adoptiveparents  = \n| stepparents      = \n| siblings         = \n| spouse = {{Plainlist |\n* Rosalie Martinez (divorced)\n* [[Lucas Jones]] (2016\u2013)\n}}\n| civilpartner     =\n| adoptivesons = {{Plainlist|\n* Wylie Cooper-Jones \n* [[Children of General Hospital#Jonah Corinthos|Jonah Corinthos]] (illegal)<ref name=GH072618>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); [[Scott McKinsey]] ([[Television director|Director]]); Suzanne Flynn ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 26, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14087|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH073018>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); Denise Van Cleve ([[Television director|Director]]); Kate Hall ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 30, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14089|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH073118>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); [[Elizabeth Korte]] ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 31, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14090|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH080218>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); Charlotte Gibson ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= August 2, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14092|language= English}}</ref>\n}}\n| adoptivechildren = \n| stepchildren     = \n| grandchildren    = \n| grandparents     = \n| aunts            = [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Jade Soong]]\n| nieces/nephews   = \n| cousins          = \n| relatives        = [[List of General Hospital characters#W|Mr. Wu]]\n}}\n'''Bradley \"Brad\" Cooper''' was introduced to the series on February 13, 2013, played by an unknown actor.

Trey is the producer of Kristina's reality television show ''Mob Princess'', and manipulates her into continuing the show despite her family's disapproval. Trey immediately clashes with Kristina's parents, [[Alexis Davis]] and mob boss Sonny Corinthos. He convinces Sonny to agree to the reality show while keeping his mysterious boss up-to-date on the project. Trey moves into his new apartment and clashes with his roommate, [[Starr Manning]]. Meanwhile, Kristina's brother, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] accuses Trey of manipulating and using both Kristina and Starr, though he denies it. Trey continues to make enemies when it comes to Starr's father, [[Todd Manning|Todd]], while he is oblivious to the fact that Kristina has a crush on him. Meanwhile, Trey bashes Sonny's girlfriend [[Kate Howard]] when it is revealed that her alternate personality caused the car accident killing Starr's family. Meanwhile, Kristina reveals her true feelings for Trey and they share their first kiss in July 2012; however, Trey is hesitant about getting involved with her fearing it will interfere with the show. It is soon revealed that Trey is actually the son of Sonny's longtime nemesis [[#Joe Scully, Jr.|Joe Scully Jr]], who is financing the show. Kristina continues her flirtatious behavior while Trey becomes determined to catch Sonny doing something illegal on camera. Trey is shocked to find his father in prison in [[Atlantic City]]. Joe admits that his father Joe Sr. was a mobster that Sonny used to work for, and convinces Trey to keep his true identity a secret so they can get revenge on Sonny for framing him for murder. He also coerces Trey into ending the reality show and romancing Kristina. In late August, Joe coerces Trey into eloping with Kristina [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Trey leads Kristina to believe that they have to get married for the show so he won't be sued. In September 2012, Trey has a confrontation with Kate, who recognizes a medal that he was wearing as being identical to one that Joe wore the night he raped her, leading her to realize that Trey is the son she conceived as the result of the rape. This revelation prompts Kate's alter, Connie, to emerge, and she proceeds to tell Trey that she wished he had never been born. In October 2012, Joe abducts Kristina on orders from [[Cesar Faison]], who intends to have Joe kill her in an convoluted effort to gain control of Sonny's assets. Trey attempts to wrestle the gun away from Joe, but inadvertently ends up shooting him the shoulder, resulting in Joe fleeing the scene before he can fulfill Faison's orders. Subsequently, Trey's connection to Joe is revealed, prompting Kristina to end her marriage to him, and Trey is evicted from the apartment he shared with [[Starr Manning]] by its original owner, [[Maxie Jones]]. Trey spends the next few months living at the local church, all the while attempting to aid Sonny in his quest to have Connie committed to Shadybrook Sanitarium, which ultimately fails. As time goes on, Trey and Kristina reconcile, and plan to relocate to California. However, their plans are derailed when, on New Year's Eve, they are involved in a car accident, which causes an aneurysm in Trey's brain to rupture, rendering him brain dead on January 8, 2013.

When the two teenagers began dating, Josslyn's mother, Carly Corinthos ([[Laura Wright]]) became eager to meet Kim, which Oscar kept delaying due to Kim's long working hours. However, when Carly invited Kim to Thanksgiving dinner, she eagerly accepted the invitation. At the dinner, Kim met [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason Morgan]] ([[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]]), who she recognized as Andrew Cain. Carly explained that Jason was Drew's twin brother, and that the two had been separated at birth. With Carly eager to know what Kim knew about Drew, who had been rendered amnesiac and had required facial reconstruction surgery due to injuries sustained in an auto accident, Kim explained she had casually dated Drew for a short time in San Diego. After Drew, who was a Navy SEAL, was redeployed, Kim discovered she was pregnant with Oscar and attempted to contact him, but was told that he deserted and eventually stopped looking for him. Years later, Kim had attempted to run Oscar's DNA through an ancestry site in order to locate Drew or any of his family due to Oscar's curiosity about his father. It was at this point that Kim learned that Oscar had family living in Port Charles, so she and Oscar relocated in order to find Drew and his family. Shocked to discover that Oscar was Quartermaine following her move from Mercy Hospital to General Hospital, Kim was greeted warmly by chief of staff [[Monica Quartermaine|Dr. Monica Quartermaine]] ([[Leslie Charleson]]), Oscar's grandmother. Despite having no memory of his relationship with Kim, Drew ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) was eager to build a relationship with Oscar. In an effort to spark some memory of his past, Kim gave Drew a CD of music that he had made for her before he left San Diego, for which he was grateful. With no indication that Drew recalled their past or harbored any romantic feelings towards her, Kim focused on her role at General Hospital and struck up a friendship with [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]), which later turned into a romantic relationship. In September 2018, Oscar was revealed to be dying of an inoperable Grade IV Glioblastoma, which had Kim had been aware of for two years without telling him. Oscar was furious with his mother for lying to him and began to drift toward a cult led by Hank \"Shiloh\" Archer (Coby Ryan McLaughlin), but never became substantially involved with them. On New Years, Kim kissed Drew, and in his anger Julian ended his relationship with her, even going so far to lie about sleeping with someone else. After some time, Kim and Julian were able to reconcile their relationship. In March 2019, Dr. Terry Randolph (Cassandra James) informed Kim, Drew and Oscar that the Glioblastoma had advanced, and Oscar had only six months to live. On April 29, 2019, three and half weeks after experiencing a severe seizure, Oscar died surrounded by Josslyn, Kim and Drew at the Quartermaine Mansion. Oscar was cremated and honoring his wishes, a devastated Kim and Drew climbed to the summit of Kilimanjaro and scattered his ashes there. In her grief, Kim began to spiral out of control, becoming obsessed with having another baby. After failing to convince Julian to conceive a child with her, she drugged and attempted to rape Drew at the wedding reception for [[Franco Baldwin]] ([[Roger Howarth]]) and [[Elizabeth Webber]] ([[Rebecca Herbst]]) as an alternative. Julian, recognizing that Kim was losing control, was able to stop her and after waking up and realizing what had happened, Drew opted not to press charges against her. In August 2019, a flash drive containing Drew's memories prior to arriving in Port Charles was stolen by Shiloh, who had kidnapped [[Cameron Webber]] ([[William Lipton]]) and attempted to implant them into his brain. Having been discovered by Franco, he opted to take Cameron's place in the experiment, and once he woke up, firmly believed himself to be Drew Cain. After running into Kim at General Hospital, Franco began relaying memories of Drew's past with Kim to her as if he himself had lived them. Distressed and demanding answers as to what was going, Elizabeth and the real Drew explained everything to her. Shortly thereafter, Drew left Port Charles in an effort to locate Dr. Andre Maddox ([[Anthony Montgomery]]), who he believed stood the best chance of restoring Franco to his former self. When Drew was declared dead after his plane has crashed, Kim began to fall in love with Franco and became convinced that she had a second shot at the relationship she had missed out on years earlier with Drew. Desperate for a future with \"Drew\" free of his ties to all of Franco's loved ones, Kim sought help from attorney Martin Gray ([[Michael E. Knight]]) in an effort to grant Franco the right to live his life as Drew Cain. As their relationship deepened, the two made plans to leave Port Charles and begin their life together. Following a conversation with [[Scott Baldwin]] ([[Kin Shriner]]), who explained to \"Drew\" that Franco had protected him from sexual predator Jim Harvey as a child, \"Drew\" informed Kim that he couldn't leave with her, and that he owed it to Franco to try to give him his life back, effectively ending their relationship.

He believes that Nina overdosed when she found out about his affair with [[Ava Jerome]], and has been in a coma for 20 years. However, Nina's brother, Detective [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]], believes Silas tried to kill her, and investigates the case. He finds out that it was actually Nina's mother [[Madeline Reeves]], who tried to kill Nina, because Nina was pregnant with Silas' child. She wanted to get rid of Nina's baby, and accidentally put her own daughter in a coma. Madeline tells Nathan that Nina has died, but later says that she only had Nina declared dead to get the inheritance that was left to Nina by Madeline's late husband.\n\nNina first appears onscreen in May 2014, waking up from her coma. Roughly a month later, Nina arrives in Port Charles, and shocks a bewildered Silas with her presence. Both Silas and Nathan are happy that she's alive, but Nina soon has to find out that much has changed. She is introduced to [[Kiki Jerome]], Silas' daughter with Ava. Silas is also now dating [[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]], despite Nina still showing an interest in him. After first not being aware that Silas and Sam are a couple, Nina claims to be fine with it; accepting the end of her marriage; and tells Silas that it would only be natural for his life to go on. However it is later revealed that Nina has been awake for longer than she says and that she trashed Silas' apartment a few months back. Nina in fact wants revenge on everyone that wronged her. Nina married [[Ric Lansing]] on May 18, 2015.\n\nIn November 2015, Nina goes to [[Julian Jerome]], who owns ''Crimson'' magazine under his media empire, for a job. She ends up getting the job of [[editor-in-chief]] since the former had left the magazine. She works closely with [[Maxie Jones]]. When Nina and Maxie need someone to take pictures for the Nutcracker Gala, Maxie has an idea that [[Dillon Quartermaine]] (Robert Palmer Watkins) should stay in town, work for Nina, and take pictures of everyone at the Gala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/general-hospital-previews-their-nutcracker-gala-with-first-look-photos/2015/12/06/|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 6, 2015|work=Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=General Hospital Previews Their Nutcracker Gala With First Look Photos!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghdailydish.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-nutcracker-gala.html|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 21, 2015|work=GH Daily Blog|title=The Nutcracker Gala}}</ref> In October 2018, a DNA test is arranged by Valentin (James Patrick Stuart) and confirms that Sasha Gilmore is Nina's daughter; however, it is later revealed that Valentin hired her to pretend to be her daughter.

Though she rejects him, Carlos plants seeds of doubt in her about Patrick's devotion because he is still wearing his wedding ring. Carlos is eventually revealed to be the mob enforcer for [[Julian Jerome]]. Days before Patrick and Sabrina's wedding, Carlos sees Robin Scorpio, Patrick's presumed dead wife and Sonny's presumed dead friend alive. He tells Sabrina, but she refuses to believe him. Carlos is later kidnapped by rival mob boss Sonny Corinthos, and lies about claiming to be the brother of Sonny's late [[Lily Corinthos|Lily]] (Lilly Melgar) hoping it will keep him alive. However, it is revealed that Carlos is lying, but before Sonny's henchman, [[Shawn Butler]] can kill him, Carlos escapes with help from [[TJ Ashford]]. Carlos is shot during a shootout, and makes his way to Sabrina's. When Sabrina learns she is pregnant, Carlos claims to be the father despite knowing the child is Patrick's. Sabrina tells the truth to Patrick about him being the child's father and not Carlos. Carlos is then arrested for the murder of [[AJ Quartermaine]]. [[Ava Jerome]] visits him and threatens him if he babbles the truth about AJ then she will hurt Sabrina. So for Sabrina's sake, he pleads guilty. When Sabrina visits him in jail, he lies to her that he killed AJ and that he was lying to her all this time. Unable to bear the pain, Sabrina leaves. Months later, Sabrina visits Carlos in jail to fill him in on how she found out the truth, indicating that she is no longer upset with him. In May 2015, Carlos kills [[Duke Lavery]] by delivering a fatal gunshot wound to his abdomen. In retaliation, Carlos is killed by Anna Devane on the docks of the Port Charles Harbor. In late November 2015, Carlos shows up at Sabrina's door. Apparently, Rivera had not died. He sees that Sabrina is pregnant and thinks the baby is his. At first she denies it, but when he overhears a private conversation between Felix and her, he realizes that the baby is his and not the child of [[Michael Corinthos]], Sabrina's boyfriend. Sabrina still wants to keep the secret, feeling Carlos is dangerous to be around. However, when Michael finds out the truth, he leaves Sabrina, and she decides to go on the run with Carlos. Their son is born while they are fugitives, and they run with the help of [[Paul Hornsby]]. Carlos is found by Sonny and Anna in Colombia, and they bring him back to Port Charles to stand trial for murdering Duke. However, Carlos threatens Paul to help him escape. Carlos manages to escape from the prisoner transport van, and calls Julian for help to find a way out of town. Julian, though, stabs Carlos and throws him into the harbor. He's found by Michael, who brings him to the hospital, where Carlos succumbs to his injuries.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Aaron Roland==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Aaron Roland\n| series         = General Hospital\n| portrayer      = [[John DeLuca]]\n| creator        = [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Jean Passanante]]\n| years     = 2016\n| first          = April 27, 2016\n| last = August 11, 2016\n| classification = [[List of previous General Hospital cast members|Former; recurring]]\n| occupation     = Manager of ''Perks Coffee'' (2016\u2013)\n}}\n'''Aaron Roland''', played by [[John DeLuca]], was introduced in April 2016 and departed in August 2016.

Sonny and Brenda confront Suzanne about her schemes and she claims she is worried Sonny's enemies will target Brenda. It is then revealed that Suzanne is actually married to the Balkan, aka Theo Hoffman. The duo want Brenda to answer for their son, Aleksander's death in 2007. After Theo kidnaps Brenda with the help of [[Shawn Butler]] ([[Sean Blakemore]]), it is revealed that Brenda gave birth to Aleksander's stillborn son with Suzanne by her side. Theo immediately assumes the child lived as it was Suzanne who witnessed the birth. Though denying Theo's accusations, she harbors resentment toward her husband for allowing their son into the criminal life. During Theo's search for their grandson, Suzanne kills him. Suzanne continues to raise her grandson in secret, but to keep Brenda and Sonny from finding him, she presents Brenda with another little boy named Lucian, and pretends he is the child. When Sonny demands a DNA test, Suzanne kidnaps the boy and skips town. Fortunately, Suzanne is found in [[San Antonio]] with Brenda's biological son, Alec.
