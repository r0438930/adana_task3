The crew members then start dying, and the survivors find themselves faced with an army of hollow-eyed homicidal ghosts.\n\nIn the form of Prentis, played by Paul Kaye, this episode sees a return for the [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q\u2013Z)#Tivolian|Tivolians]], a race last seen in the 2011 episode \"[[The God Complex]]\", also written by Toby Whithouse.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Arnopp |first= Jason |date= November 2015|title= Episode Previews: Under the Lake & Before the Flood |journal= [[Doctor Who Magazine]] |publisher= Panini UK Ltd. }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe crew of an underwater mining facility in [[Caithness]], Scotland in 2119 discover an alien craft in the ruins of a submerged town. They bring it aboard only to find it is missing one of its two power cells, and four glyphs carved into the interior walls. Suddenly the craft's engines ignite, and Commander Moran is killed in the act of pushing another out of the way. Later, the crew finds two ghostly figures, Moran and an unidentified alien, roaming during the night cycle, soundlessly chanting before turning to attack the crew. The crew take shelter in the base's [[Faraday cage]] which the ghosts cannot enter.\n\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] arrive later via the [[TARDIS]] and are briefed by acting commander Cass, who is deaf and assisted by her interpreter Lunn. Suddenly the base's systems switch to the night cycle, and before they can restore the day cycle, the ghosts have killed another crew member, and soon the ghost of that crew joins the other two. The Doctor recognises the alien ghost as Tivolian, a cowardly, peaceful race. Cass calls for an evacuation shuttle only to learn one has already been dispatched. The Doctor orders it to turn around, believing the ghosts have a nefarious purpose.\n\nThe Doctor is able to lure the ghosts into the Faraday cage, and with Cass's help, can read what they are chanting: \"the dark, the sword, the forsaken, the temple\". The Doctor determines these are galactic coordinates pointing to this location, and believes that the ghosts are killing the crew and trying to draw more victims to boost the strength of the broadcast of this signal; however, only those that have seen the glyphs in the ship are susceptible to the ghosts' influence. Using the base's remote drones, they find and collect a stasis chamber among the ruins, which the Doctor suspects is what the coordinates point to, but they cannot open it. The Doctor determines he must go back in time before the town was flooded to find the origin of the signal. The ghosts manipulate hatchways that separate Clara, Cass, and Lunn from the Doctor and crew members O'Donnell and Bennett. The Doctor promises Clara he will be back, and takes O'Donnell and Bennett with him to the TARDIS. Shortly after the TARDIS' departure, Clara, Cass, and Lunn witness a new ghost outside of the base \u2013 that of the Doctor.\n\n===Continuity===\nThe Doctor says that the ghost in the top hat is from the planet Tivoli, first mentioned in the [[Eleventh Doctor]] story \"The God Complex\", which featured a member of its native species named Gibbis.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4YFWPhGQjwsBjLbzjQwzgtw/under-the-lake-the-fact-file|title=BBC One \u2013 Doctor Who, Series 9, Under the Lake \u2013 Under the Lake: The Fact File|work=BBC}}</ref>\n\nWhen pondering what the ghosts actually are, the Doctor eliminates the possibility that they are Flesh avatars (\"[[The Rebel Flesh]]\" / \"[[The Almost People]]\"), [[Auton]]s (''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' et al.), or digital copies in the Nethersphere (\"[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]\" / \"[[Death in Heaven]]\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-hints-teasers-set-1-76528.htm|title=Under the Lake: Hints & Teasers (Set #1)|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-review-76631.htm|title=Under the Lake Review|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOne of the Doctor's \"cards\" has him offering reassurance that no-one, among other disasters, is going to be \"exterminated/upgraded\".

He further went on to say \"It's this sense of claustrophobia that is among the episode's biggest selling points \u2013 watching a crew's camaraderie crumble as the pressure gets to them never grows old. Gloomy visuals and a haunting score from Murray Gold also do much to generate atmosphere and tension\" and closed his review stating \"Chills, action, adventure \u2013 this is old-school Doctor Who given a modern sheen and, most of all, it's enormous fun\".<ref name=\"digitalspy\"/> Michael Hogan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' acclaimed the episode, awarding it a perfect five stars. He said \"This rollicking, hair-raising romp demonstrated that the sci-fi franchise still has the power to thrill and chill in equal measure\". He closed his review by claiming \"Forty minutes flew by and the credits rolled too soon, leaving on a creepy cliffhanger that left me baying for more. If next week\u2019s conclusion of the story \u2013 and the 12-part series as a whole \u2013 can keep up the standard set by the opening three episodes, we\u2019re in for a treat.

Calling the episode \"impeccably structured\", he further stated that it \"has a tightness of narrative focus that often eludes the first episodes of Doctor Who two-parters\". He closed his review by saying the episode \"works beautifully as a propulsive monsters story\" and stating \"A simple, focused first episode figures to set up a twisted, sprawling second half. But even without seeing the payoff, it\u2019s hard to imagine more efficient narrative construction for whatever that conclusion might be\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Alisdair|title=Doctor Who tells a real ghost story, then gets crazy|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/doctor-who-tells-real-ghost-story-then-gets-crazy-226272 |work=The A.V.

He further went on to say \"It's this sense of claustrophobia that is among the episode's biggest selling points \u2013 watching a crew's camaraderie crumble as the pressure gets to them never grows old. Gloomy visuals and a haunting score from Murray Gold also do much to generate atmosphere and tension\" and closed his review stating \"Chills, action, adventure \u2013 this is old-school Doctor Who given a modern sheen and, most of all, it's enormous fun\".<ref name=\"digitalspy\"/> Michael Hogan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' acclaimed the episode, awarding it a perfect five stars. He said \"This rollicking, hair-raising romp demonstrated that the sci-fi franchise still has the power to thrill and chill in equal measure\". He closed his review by claiming \"Forty minutes flew by and the credits rolled too soon, leaving on a creepy cliffhanger that left me baying for more. If next week\u2019s conclusion of the story \u2013 and the 12-part series as a whole \u2013 can keep up the standard set by the opening three episodes, we\u2019re in for a treat.

Calling the episode \"impeccably structured\", he further stated that it \"has a tightness of narrative focus that often eludes the first episodes of Doctor Who two-parters\". He closed his review by saying the episode \"works beautifully as a propulsive monsters story\" and stating \"A simple, focused first episode figures to set up a twisted, sprawling second half. But even without seeing the payoff, it\u2019s hard to imagine more efficient narrative construction for whatever that conclusion might be\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Alisdair|title=Doctor Who tells a real ghost story, then gets crazy|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/doctor-who-tells-real-ghost-story-then-gets-crazy-226272 |work=The A.V.

He further stated \"As secrets were uncovered and deductions made, the plot rattled along with a pace that ended up as satisfying as it was intriguing\", and closed his review by saying \"in terms of wonderfully solid and spooky TV there\u2019s nothing to moan about here\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Jon |title=Doctor Who, Under the Lake, TV review: Extraterrestrial ghost story is scarier than the Daleks |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/doctor-who-under-the-lake-tv-review-extraterrestrial-ghost-story-is-more-terrifying-than-the-daleks-a6677251.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref> Scott Collura of [[IGN]] was also highly impressed with the episode, awarding it a score of 8.5/10, deemed by the site as \"great\". He particularly praised the episode's cliffhanger ending, stating \"But oh, the ending of this episode!
