As a child, she won local children's drawing contests and in her teens attended a school, [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]], known for its arts instruction.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> Between 1924 and 1929 she studied at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] where she worked under [[Kenneth Hayes Miller]], [[Boardman Robinson]], and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the summer months she traveled to Europe and during one of these trips studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] in Paris.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> She had one additional period of training in the late 1940s when she learned techniques of abstraction and expressionism from [[Jack Tworkov]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\n==Career in art==\n\nWhen she was not traveling, Eisner lived in [[Greenwich Village]] and rented a studio on Cornelia Street.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/><ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> In 1930 she contributed a still life in a group show at the Opportunity Gallery that also included works by [[Edith Hamlin]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1930\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of collectors along with the artist Gifford Beal set up the nonprofit Opportunity Gallery in the fall of 1927.<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\"/> Each exhibition was selected by a well-known artist with the overall goal of showing new talent in a wide range of artistic styles.<ref name=\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle Nov 1927\"/> [[Mark Rothko]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] all showed at the gallery during its early years.<ref name=\"The Opportunity Gallery\"/> }} Throughout the rest of the decade her paintings appeared frequently in shows held by nonprofit organizations, including Salons of America (1931, 1932, 1933), the [[Society of Independent Artists]] (1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937), the [[College Art Association]] (traveling exhibitions in 1932 and 1933), the [[National Association of Women Artists|National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors]] (annually, 1933 to 1939), the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] (1934), and the [[New York Society of Women Artists]] (1935, 1936, 1938).<ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/>{{refn|group=note|In 1922 [[Hamilton Easter Field]] founded Salons of America to give artists an alternative to the Society of Independent Artists whose financial and publicity methods he found objectionable. A reporter said he aimed \"to give equal opportunity to every member, whether he or she be a conservative or a post-Dadaist.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Jul 1922\"/>}} In these large shows Eisner's paintings were regularly singled out for praise by New York critics. Thus, for example, in 1936 the ''New York Post'' critic noted her \"thorough and vigorous\" canvases.<ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/> In 1937 Edward Alden Jewell of the ''Times'' called attention to her free brushwork.<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1937\"/> In 1938, a ''Post'' critic called one of her paintings \"the outstanding canvas of the show.\"<ref name=\"New York Post Feb 1938\"/>\n\nIn 1932 the Morton Gallery mounted her first solo exhibition. In it, she showed paintings depicting life in the mountains of the [[Carolinas]].<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Critics responded favorably to the show. A review in the ''New York Post'' said she had technical facility and showed her subjects freshly and spontaneously.<ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/> Writing in the ''New York Sun'', a critic wrote that the paintings were social documents that revealed life in the southern mountains in a way that was \"vastly entertaining.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/> A critic for the ''New York Times'' noticed that Eisner showed more interest in the people she encountered than in the scenic environment in which they passed their lives and concluded that \"she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/>  Her depiction of a fiddler drew attention in both the ''Sun'' and the ''Times''. Late in life, a contemporary of Eisner's, [[Joseph Solman]], said of the [[Social realism|social realist]] style of the time: \"We were all seeking the flat, and the exaggerated, and the expressionist in our own romantic, different ways.\"<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\"/>\n\nTwo years later the Delphic Studio gave Eisner and Grace Bliss Stewart a duo exhibition. On this occasion the ''New York Sun'' featured a photo of another Carolina mountains painting, \"Franklin's View.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/>{{refn|group=note|Journalist and art patron [[Alma Reed]] founded Delphic Studios in 1929. Mainly known for its emphasis on Mexican art, the gallery also showed photographers, such as [[Edward Weston]] and [[Ansel Adams]] as well as Eisner and other contemporary American artists.<ref name=\"Delphic Studio\"/> }} The ''Sun'''s critic, who found her work to be on the whole \"attractive,\" used the label \"communist\" as shorthand for Eisner's social realist style in her mountain paintings. The critic said, \"[she] paints citizens who have a good deal of the soil upon their clothes.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Howard Devree of the ''New York Times'' said the paintings showed increased strength and sureness and praised her use of warm reds in a generally low palette.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/>\n\n[[File:1937DeweyCommission.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Dewey Commission, 1937, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\nIn the late 1930s Eisner exhibited as a member of a [[popular front]] organization called the [[American Artists' Congress]].<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1937\"/> After the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]] in 1940 she and a small group of like-minded artists quit the Congress to found an avowedly non-political organization called the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"Federation of modern painters and sculptors 2018\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of New York artists formed the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in the spring of 1940. All had resigned from the American Artists' Congress to protest its \"Stalinist line\" after the congress had endorsed the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/> The federation aimed to be non-political. Its principal goal was to promote artistic independence and its members adhered to no specific style or school of painting. By means of exhibitions, publications, and lectures it set itself to promote the \"general interest of contemporary art.\" In addition to Eisner and her sister Anne, founding members included [[Isabel Bishop]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Anne Goldthwaite]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Balcomb Greene]], and [[Mark Rothko]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1942\"/> }} In 1937 Eisner and her husband traveled to Mexico to help the [[Dewey Commission]] investigate charges leveled against [[Leon Trotsky]] by the Soviet government in the [[Moscow Trials]] of 1936\u20131937. Eisner made a painting of commission members interviewing Trotsky in a house on the outskirts of Mexico City owned by Rivera and [[Frida Kahlo]]. The painting (shown at left) contains a view of [[Diego Rivera]] who is making a sketch of the scene.<ref name=\"Trotsky Commission Painting\"/> She also made two portraits of Trotsky. The two of them joked about a time when she scraped off pigment in painting his face. He made an affectionate, albeit macabre joke that she was beheading him.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> This painting is shown in the photo of Trotsky and Eisner at top right.\n\nAfter World War II Eisner traveled widely with her husband. His work as a journalist for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine and his passion for fishing helped to determine the locations they visited. In 1947 they spent time on [[Cape Breton Island]] and, beginning in 1949 they started to make periodic visits to [[Livingston, Montana]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Returning from Montana in the early 1950s, Eisner began a short period of study with [[Jack Tworkov]] in New York.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/>{{refn|group=note|Tworkov taught art throughout much of his career. In the early 1930s he taught briefly at the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]] in Manhattan. Between 1948 and 1958 he was a part-time instructor at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] and [[Pratt Institute]]. He was also at one time an instructor at [[Black Mountain College]] and in the 1960s taught at the [[Yale School of Art]], becoming chair of the art department in 1963.<ref name=\"Tworkov Papers AAA\"/> }} In 1960 she and her husband began spending summer months on [[Great Cranberry Island]].<ref name=\"Art of Acadia 2016\"/>\n\nDuring these years and continuing into the 1970s she continued exhibiting with the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/><ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/> During this period she also continued to be given solo exhibitions in New York commercial galleries. In 1961 she was given a solo exhibition at the James Gallery and in 1966 and in 1969 at the Cisneros Gallery.<ref name=\"New York Times Feb 1961\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1966\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1969\"/>\n\nAfter her death in 1984 she was given a succession of retrospective exhibitions. These included the [[Farnsworth Art Museum]] (1992, \"Dorothy Eisner: Paintings and Collages\"), Acme Fine Art (Boston, 2005, \"Late Expressionist Paintings,\" and 2009, \"Dorothy Eisner on Cranberry Island\"), [[Ogunquit Museum of American Art|Ogunquit Museum]] (2008, Cranberry Island paintings), and Gleason Fine Art (Boothbay Harbor Maine, 2017).<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/><ref name=\"Boothbay Register May 2017\"/> In 2009 her work also appeared in an exhibition called \"The Art of the Cranberry Isles\" in the [[Portland Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"Bangor Daily News Mar 2009\"/>\n\n===Positions in art organizations===\n\nEisner immersed herself in the art world while still young. In 1930, aged twenty-four, she joined the board of the Society of Independent Artists. Not long afterward she became a member of the American Artists' Congress, the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the New York Society of Women Artists. As noted above, she was a founding member of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in 1941.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> It seems likely that her marriage, the war, and the birth of a daughter (1942) dampened the impulse to participate in other organizations.\n\n===Artistic style===\n[[File:1931FiddlersConvention.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Fiddlers' Convention, about 1931, black and white photographic print of an oil painting, 9 x 7 inches]]\n[[File:1958YellowstoneRiver.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Yellowstone River, about 1958, oil on canvas, 44 x 36 inches]]\n\nIn reviewing shows of the paintings she made in the 1930s, critics noticed that when choosing subjects Eisner favored people over scenery.<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Two of them saw these paintings as lively and entertaining social documents having an authentic quality.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Others pointed out a muted palette and a tendency to drabness along with strong composition, ability to develop a subject freshly and spontaneously, and overall vigor and thoroughness.<ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/> For example, a critic for the ''New York Sun'' said Eisner painted her subjects \"roughly, but with a curious instinct for balance that makes the panels, as a whole, attractive.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Writing in the ''New York Times'' Howard Devree noted Eisner's skill in delineating subjects convincingly and praised her growing strength and sureness.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/> The painting, \"Fiddlers' Convention\" (shown at left) was mentioned as typical of her better 1930s work.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> In 1934 it was reproduced in an article in the ''Philadelphia Record'' reviewing the Pennsylvania Academy's 129th annual exhibition.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\nEisner's style changed little during the 1930s and war years. During the post-war period, while most of her work remained realist, she began to study under [[Jack Tworkov]]. Although much [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painting was then anti-figurative, Tworkov, like his friend [[Willem de Kooning]], believed that even so-called pure abstraction made, as he said, \"analogy to the figure.\" His obituary in the ''New York Times'' quoted him as saying \"Every painter has a subject whether or not there are objects in his paintings.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Sep 1982\"/> Eisner responded sympathetically to this approach. Later she was quoted as saying, \"Abstract Expressionism made me think differently. I learned from it a language of shapes and color that I was not conscious of when I was young.\"<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> During this period she produced much work in regular visits to the American [[mountain states]], particularly Livingston, Montana, and nearby [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Her painting \"Yellowstone River\" (seen at right) shows the influence of Tworkov's instruction. While it might be taken as a pure abstraction, the title shows it to be an abstract representation of a real place.\n\n[[File:1965PortraitInLight.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Portrait in Light, 1965, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\n[[File:1981InteriorStillLife.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Interior Still Life, 1981, oil on canvas, 24 x 30 inches]] \nIn 1960, when Eisner and her husband began spending summers on Great Cranberry Island, her work showed a new [[figurative art|figurative]] style. She often showed people relaxing and engaging in vacation-time pursuits: playing cards or croquet. Just as often her subjects would be inanimate: desks, chairs, windows, a towel rack. Writing in 2008 concerning a retrospective exhibition that showed these paintings, a critic said, \"her subject matter is so seemingly mundane that the viewer is startled by her choice.\"<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/> Although abstract, her style was firmly grounded in specific places at specific times, and its realist subjects were clearly evident. She made expressionistic use of bold colors, as she had in her 1950s abstractions, but in a style that critics saw as fluid, masterfully composed, and expressionistic.<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/> A critic said the paintings she made on Cranberry Island were orderly, distinct, and painted with great spirit.<ref name=\"Portland Press Herald Oct 2008\"/>\n\nAn early painting from this period, \"Portrait in Light\" (shown at left), has a greater degree of abstraction than a painting, \"Interior Still Life\" (shown at right) made only three years before her death. The latter work seems to show an influence of Matisse that critics saw in her work from the time she spent studying at Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> From its inception in the 1930s through to its culmination in the late paintings, Eisner's output maintained a consistency that a gallerist summarized as derived from European modernism but also grounded in American painting of her own generation and the generation before her.<ref name=\"Gleason Fine Art\"/>\n\n==Personal life and family==\n\nEisner was born in New York on January 17, 1906.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Her father was William J. Eisner. He was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1880 and died in New York in 1975.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Orphaned while still young, he left school at 13 and later became one of the first makers of wax paper in the United States. Having moved to New York he was for many years president of a business called the Newark Paraffin and Parchment Paper Co.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/> Eisner's mother was Florine Eisner (1883-1974). Her father's name was Moritz Eisner. Born in Austria, he studied to be a chemist and after emigrating to the United States founded a business called Eisner-Mendelson Company that sold a malt extract and other health products.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1938\"/> After her marriage in 1905, Florine Eisner's maiden and married surnames were the same.\n\nEisner had a sister, [[Anne Eisner Putnam]] (1911-1967), who followed in her sister's footsteps. She studied at the Art Students League and served on its board of directors. She showed professionally during the 1940s with the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. After her marriage to Patrick Putnam she lived in the [[Ituri Rainforest]] within the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Belgian Congo]] in a campsite adjacent to pygmies of the  [[Mbuti people]]. Patrick Putnam, who had an unpaid position as agent sanitaire, ran an informal dispensary and anthropological laboratory. For eight years Anne Eisner Putnam operated a small collection of guest houses from which she rented out rooms to visitors so as to support her husband's work.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Jun 1956\"/> Following Patrick's death in 1953 she returned to New York where she published a book, ''Madami: My Eight Years of Adventure with the Congo Pygmies'', describing her experiences and celebrating the Mbuti culture which she deeply respected.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Dec 1954\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s Florine Eisner (1883-1974) followed the example set by both daughters by studying at the Art Students League. Using Florine Rensie as her name, she joined the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and became a professional artist (Rensie is Eisner spelled backward).<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> After he retired from business in the early 1950s, William J. Eisner joined the rest of the family in studying art and becoming a professional artist.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nWilliam and Florine raised their family in Manhattan. During the warm months of the year they frequently traveled to their country home in Woodstock, New York and, after the children had grown they followed the example they had set and both became serious artists. William exhibited under his own name in galleries in nearby Kingston, New York, while Florine adopted Florine Rensie as her professional name to avoid the appearance of capitalizing on her daughters' artistic successes .<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nEarly in the 1930s Eisner worked in New York for the [[Resettlement Administration]]. In 1935 she met her future husband, [[John McDonald (journalist)|John Dennis McDonald]] (1906-1998), who was then working for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] and in 1936 they married.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a master's degree in literature and subsequently immersed himself in the socialist politics of the 1930s, particularly the [[anti-Stalinist left]]. In 1937 he joined the [[Dewey Commission]] as a technical assistant. He and Eisner traveled to Mexico with the commission staff. Chaired by the philosopher [[John Dewey]], the commission aimed to provide [[Leon Trotsky]] with a fair hearing of the charges made against him in the [[Moscow trials|Soviet show trials]] of 1936. While they opposed Stalinism, he and Eisner, like most members of the commission, were not themselves [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the latter part of the 1930s, McDonald worked for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in Washington, D.C. During World War II he worked in New York for a nonprofit motion picture production company called the American Film Center.{{refn|group=note|Founded by Donald Slesinger, a psychologist and law school dean, and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, the American Film Center supported producers of educational and documentary films and produced films for the [[Office of Civilian Defense]]. Slesinger's inept management brought the center to bankruptcy in 1946.<ref name=\"Learning With Lights Off 2012\"/>  }} In 1945 he began work as a staff writer at [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine. In 1949 he joined its editorial board and remained in that position until he retired in 1971. His writings showed a wide breadth of his interest, including economic theory and game theory as well as fishing and horse racing.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/> The author of scholarly texts as well as journal articles, he was best known for a book that listed him as editor although he was in fact its author: ''My Years with General Motors, by Alfred P. Sloan Jr.'' (1964).<ref name=\"Boston Globe Nov 2002\"/>\n\nMcDonald had a daughter, Joan (born 1929), by a prior, relatively brief, marriage with Lorraine Oven.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/> Eisner and McDonald had one child, a daughter, Christie Anne (born 1942), who, at time of this writing, is the Smith Professor of French Language and Literature and Chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/><ref name=\"Christie McDonald Harvard\"/>\n\nEisner died in New York on April 28, 1984.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist\n|colwidth=30em\n|refs=\n\n<!-- journals -->\n\n<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\">{{cite journal |author=Christie McDonald |date=2006 |volume= |issue=30 |pages=142\u2013149 | title=Brushes with History |jstor=27569177 |journal=Harvard Review |location= |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<!-- books -->\n\n<ref name=\"Learning With Lights Off 2012\">{{cite book |author1=Devin Orgeron |author2=Marsha Orgeron |author3=Dan Streible |title=Learning with the Lights Off: Educational Film in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXxMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA244 |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-045251-3 |pages=243\u2013245}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Art of Acadia 2016\">{{cite book |author1=David Little |author2=Carl Little |title=Art of Acadia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIg1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA181 |date=1 August 2016 |publisher=Down East Books |isbn=978-1-60893-475-1 |page=181}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC |title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life |publisher=Upne |year=1989 |format= |page=302 |author=Roxana Robinson |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\">{{cite book |author1=Lawrence Alloway |author2=Mary D.

Writers have been far in advance of artists in discovering the possibilities of subject-matter in this section. It is not the beauties of mountain landscape that have attracted Miss Eisner, but rather the individuality of people and the interest of their pastimes. A \"Fiddlers' Convention\" and a dance called \"Bird in Buzzard Out\" Miss Eisner evidently watched closely, for she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer. Individuals, too, she has portrayed in portrait studies. Although there is some authentic quality of the South in these paintings, they incline toward drabness of color, and the figures have not enough animation to make them live in paint. Most successfully realized are several still-lifes. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\">{{cite news |title=The Etchings of Georges Rouault |author=Edward Alden Jewell |work=New York Times |location=New York, New York |date=1933-05-07 |page=X8 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\">{{cite news |title=Henry V.

As a child, she won local children's drawing contests and in her teens attended a school, [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]], known for its arts instruction.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> Between 1924 and 1929 she studied at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] where she worked under [[Kenneth Hayes Miller]], [[Boardman Robinson]], and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the summer months she traveled to Europe and during one of these trips studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] in Paris.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> She had one additional period of training in the late 1940s when she learned techniques of abstraction and expressionism from [[Jack Tworkov]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\n==Career in art==\n\nWhen she was not traveling, Eisner lived in [[Greenwich Village]] and rented a studio on Cornelia Street.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/><ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> In 1930 she contributed a still life in a group show at the Opportunity Gallery that also included works by [[Edith Hamlin]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1930\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of collectors along with the artist Gifford Beal set up the nonprofit Opportunity Gallery in the fall of 1927.<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\"/> Each exhibition was selected by a well-known artist with the overall goal of showing new talent in a wide range of artistic styles.<ref name=\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle Nov 1927\"/> [[Mark Rothko]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] all showed at the gallery during its early years.<ref name=\"The Opportunity Gallery\"/> }} Throughout the rest of the decade her paintings appeared frequently in shows held by nonprofit organizations, including Salons of America (1931, 1932, 1933), the [[Society of Independent Artists]] (1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937), the [[College Art Association]] (traveling exhibitions in 1932 and 1933), the [[National Association of Women Artists|National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors]] (annually, 1933 to 1939), the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] (1934), and the [[New York Society of Women Artists]] (1935, 1936, 1938).<ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/>{{refn|group=note|In 1922 [[Hamilton Easter Field]] founded Salons of America to give artists an alternative to the Society of Independent Artists whose financial and publicity methods he found objectionable.

Thus, for example, in 1936 the ''New York Post'' critic noted her \"thorough and vigorous\" canvases.<ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/> In 1937 Edward Alden Jewell of the ''Times'' called attention to her free brushwork.<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1937\"/> In 1938, a ''Post'' critic called one of her paintings \"the outstanding canvas of the show.\"<ref name=\"New York Post Feb 1938\"/>\n\nIn 1932 the Morton Gallery mounted her first solo exhibition.

A review in the ''New York Post'' said she had technical facility and showed her subjects freshly and spontaneously.<ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/> Writing in the ''New York Sun'', a critic wrote that the paintings were social documents that revealed life in the southern mountains in a way that was \"vastly entertaining.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/> A critic for the ''New York Times'' noticed that Eisner showed more interest in the people she encountered than in the scenic environment in which they passed their lives and concluded that \"she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/>  Her depiction of a fiddler drew attention in both the ''Sun'' and the ''Times''. Late in life, a contemporary of Eisner's, [[Joseph Solman]], said of the [[Social realism|social realist]] style of the time: \"We were all seeking the flat, and the exaggerated, and the expressionist in our own romantic, different ways.\"<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\"/>\n\nTwo years later the Delphic Studio gave Eisner and Grace Bliss Stewart a duo exhibition.

The painting (shown at left) contains a view of [[Diego Rivera]] who is making a sketch of the scene.<ref name=\"Trotsky Commission Painting\"/> She also made two portraits of Trotsky. The two of them joked about a time when she scraped off pigment in painting his face.

His work as a journalist for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine and his passion for fishing helped to determine the locations they visited. In 1947 they spent time on [[Cape Breton Island]] and, beginning in 1949 they started to make periodic visits to [[Livingston, Montana]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Returning from Montana in the early 1950s, Eisner began a short period of study with [[Jack Tworkov]] in New York.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/>{{refn|group=note|Tworkov taught art throughout much of his career.

As noted above, she was a founding member of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in 1941.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> It seems likely that her marriage, the war, and the birth of a daughter (1942) dampened the impulse to participate in other organizations.\n\n===Artistic style===\n[[File:1931FiddlersConvention.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Fiddlers' Convention, about 1931, black and white photographic print of an oil painting, 9 x 7 inches]]\n[[File:1958YellowstoneRiver.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Yellowstone River, about 1958, oil on canvas, 44 x 36 inches]]\n\nIn reviewing shows of the paintings she made in the 1930s, critics noticed that when choosing subjects Eisner favored people over scenery.<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Two of them saw these paintings as lively and entertaining social documents having an authentic quality.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Others pointed out a muted palette and a tendency to drabness along with strong composition, ability to develop a subject freshly and spontaneously, and overall vigor and thoroughness.<ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/> For example, a critic for the ''New York Sun'' said Eisner painted her subjects \"roughly, but with a curious instinct for balance that makes the panels, as a whole, attractive.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Writing in the ''New York Times'' Howard Devree noted Eisner's skill in delineating subjects convincingly and praised her growing strength and sureness.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/> The painting, \"Fiddlers' Convention\" (shown at left) was mentioned as typical of her better 1930s work.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> In 1934 it was reproduced in an article in the ''Philadelphia Record'' reviewing the Pennsylvania Academy's 129th annual exhibition.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\nEisner's style changed little during the 1930s and war years. During the post-war period, while most of her work remained realist, she began to study under [[Jack Tworkov]]. Although much [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painting was then anti-figurative, Tworkov, like his friend [[Willem de Kooning]], believed that even so-called pure abstraction made, as he said, \"analogy to the figure.\" His obituary in the ''New York Times'' quoted him as saying \"Every painter has a subject whether or not there are objects in his paintings.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Sep 1982\"/> Eisner responded sympathetically to this approach. Later she was quoted as saying, \"Abstract Expressionism made me think differently. I learned from it a language of shapes and color that I was not conscious of when I was young.\"<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> During this period she produced much work in regular visits to the American [[mountain states]], particularly Livingston, Montana, and nearby [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Her painting \"Yellowstone River\" (seen at right) shows the influence of Tworkov's instruction. While it might be taken as a pure abstraction, the title shows it to be an abstract representation of a real place.\n\n[[File:1965PortraitInLight.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Portrait in Light, 1965, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\n[[File:1981InteriorStillLife.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Interior Still Life, 1981, oil on canvas, 24 x 30 inches]] \nIn 1960, when Eisner and her husband began spending summers on Great Cranberry Island, her work showed a new [[figurative art|figurative]] style. She often showed people relaxing and engaging in vacation-time pursuits: playing cards or croquet. Just as often her subjects would be inanimate: desks, chairs, windows, a towel rack. Writing in 2008 concerning a retrospective exhibition that showed these paintings a critic said, \"her subject matter is so seemingly mundane that the viewer is startled by her choice.\"<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/> Although abstract, her style was firmly grounded in specific places at specific times, and its realist subjects were clearly evident. She made expressionistic use of bold colors, as she had in her 1950s abstractions, but in a style that critics saw as fluid, masterfully composed, and expressionistic.<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/> A critic said the paintings she made on Cranberry Island were orderly, distinct, and painted with great spirit.<ref name=\"Portland Press Herald Oct 2008\"/>\n\nAn early painting from this period, \"Portrait in Light\" (shown at left), has a greater degree of abstraction than a painting, \"Interior Still Life\" (shown at right) made only three years before her death. The latter work seems to show an influence of Matisse that critics saw in her work from the time she spent studying at Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> From its inception in the 1930s through to its culmination in the late paintings, Eisner's output maintained a consistency that a gallerist summarized as derived from European modernism but also grounded in American painting of her own generation and the generation before her.<ref name=\"Gleason Fine Art\"/>\n\n==Personal life and family==\n\nEisner was born in New York on January 17, 1906.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Her father was William J. Eisner. He was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1880 and died in New York in 1975.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Orphaned while still young, he left school at 13 and later became one of the first makers of wax paper in the United States. Having moved to New York he was for many years president of a business called the Newark Paraffin and Parchment Paper Co.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/> Eisner's mother was Florine Eisner (1883-1974). Her father's name was Moritz Eisner. Born in Austria, he studied to be a chemist and after emigrating to the United States founded a business called Eisner-Mendelson Company that sold a malt extract and other health products.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1938\"/> After her marriage in 1905, Florine Eisner's maiden and married surnames were the same.\n\nEisner had a sister, [[Anne Eisner Putnam]] (1911-1967), who followed in her sister's footsteps. She studied at the Art Students League and served on its board of directors. She showed professionally during the 1940s with the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. After her marriage to Patrick Putnam she lived in the [[Ituri Rainforest]] within the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Belgian Congo]] in a campsite adjacent to pygmies of the  [[Mbuti people]]. Patrick Putnam, who had an unpaid position as agent sanitaire, ran an informal dispensary and anthropological laboratory. For eight years Anne Eisner Putnam operated a small collection of guest houses from which she rented out rooms to visitors so as to support her husband's work.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Jun 1956\"/> Following Patrick's death in 1953 she returned to New York where she published a book, ''Madami: My Eight Years of Adventure with the Congo Pygmies'', describing her experiences and celebrating the Mbuti culture which she deeply respected.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Dec 1954\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s Florine Eisner (1883-1974) followed the example set by both daughters by studying at the Art Students League. Using Florine Rensie as her name, she joined the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and became a professional artist (Rensie is Eisner spelled backward).<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> After he retired from business in the early 1950s, William J. Eisner joined the rest of the family in studying art and becoming a professional artist.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nWilliam and Florine raised their family in Manhattan. During the warm months of the year they frequently traveled to their country home in Woodstock, New York and, after the children had grown they followed the example they had set and both became serious artists. William exhibited under his own name in galleries in nearby Kingston, New York, while Florine adopted Florine Rensie as her professional name to avoid the appearance of capitalizing on her daughters' artistic successes .<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nEarly in the 1930s Eisner worked in New York for the [[Resettlement Administration]]. In 1935 she met her future husband, [[John McDonald (journalist)|John Dennis McDonald]] (1906-1998), who was then working for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] and in 1936 they married.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a master's degree in literature and subsequently immersed himself in the socialist politics of the 1930s, particularly the [[anti-Stalinist left]]. In 1937 he joined the [[Dewey Commission]] as a technical assistant. He and Eisner traveled to Mexico with the commission staff. Chaired by the philosopher [[John Dewey]], the commission aimed to provide [[Leon Trotsky]] with a fair hearing of the charges made against him in the [[Moscow trials|Soviet show trials]] of 1936. While they opposed Stalinism, he and Eisner, like most members of the commission, were not themselves [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the latter part of the 1930s, McDonald worked for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in Washington, D.C. During World War II he worked in New York for a nonprofit motion picture production company called the American Film Center.{{refn|group=note|Founded by Donald Slesinger, a psychologist and law school dean, and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, the American Film Center supported producers of educational and documentary films and produced films for the [[Office of Civilian Defense]]. Slesinger's inept management brought the center to bankruptcy in 1946.<ref name=\"Learning With Lights Off 2012\"/>  }} In 1945 he began work as a staff writer at [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine. In 1949 he joined its editorial board and remained in that position until he retired in 1971. His writings showed a wide breadth of his interest, including economic theory and game theory as well as fishing and horse racing.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/> The author of scholarly texts as well as journal articles, he was best known for a book that listed him as editor although he was in fact its author: ''My Years with General Motors, by Alfred P. Sloan Jr.'' (1964).<ref name=\"Boston Globe Nov 2002\"/>\n\nMcDonald had a daughter, Joan (born 1929), by a prior, relatively brief, marriage with Lorraine Oven.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/> Eisner and McDonald had one child, a daughter, Christie Anne (born 1942), who, at time of this writing, is the Smith Professor of French Language and Literature and Chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/><ref name=\"Christie McDonald Harvard\"/>\n\nEisner died in New York on April 28, 1984.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist\n|colwidth=30em\n|refs=\n\n<!-- journals -->\n\n<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\">{{cite journal |author=Christie McDonald |date=2006 |volume= |issue=30 |pages=142\u2013149 | title=Brushes with History |jstor=27569177 |journal=Harvard Review |location= |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<!-- books -->\n\n<ref name=\"Learning With Lights Off 2012\">{{cite book |author1=Devin Orgeron |author2=Marsha Orgeron |author3=Dan Streible |title=Learning with the Lights Off: Educational Film in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXxMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA244 |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-045251-3 |pages=243\u2013245}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Art of Acadia 2016\">{{cite book |author1=David Little |author2=Carl Little |title=Art of Acadia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIg1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA181 |date=1 August 2016 |publisher=Down East Books |isbn=978-1-60893-475-1 |page=181}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC |title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life |publisher=Upne |year=1989 |format= |page=302 |author=Roxana Robinson |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\">{{cite book |author1=Lawrence Alloway |author2=Mary D.

Writers have been far in advance of artists in discovering the possibilities of subject-matter in this section. It is not the beauties of mountain landscape that have attracted Miss Eisner, but rather the individuality of people and the interest of their pastimes. A \"Fiddlers' Convention\" and a dance called \"Bird in Buzzard Out\" Miss Eisner evidently watched closely, for she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer. Individuals, too, she has portrayed in portrait studies. Although there is some authentic quality of the South in these paintings, they incline toward drabness of color, and the figures have not enough animation to make them live in paint. Most successfully realized are several still-lifes. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\">{{cite news |title=The Etchings of Georges Rouault |author=Edward Alden Jewell |work=New York Times |location=New York, New York |date=1933-05-07 |page=X8 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\">{{cite news |title=Henry V.

But she painted with great spirit, and the work on display in Ogunquit seems to express her personality: bold colors, quick strokes and a certain sense of place. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bangor Daily News Mar 2009\">{{cite news |title=Inspiring Isles; Portland Museum of Art highlights the Diversity of a Creative Crew from Maine's Cranberry Isles |author=Jessica Bloch |work=Bangor Daily News |location=Bangor, Maine |date=2009-03-20 |page=7 |quote=In 'Desk II,' Eisner painted an orange desk with a boat schedule, an August calendar, a list of names including Heliker, LaHotan and Kienbusch, and a big black phone prominently displayed &mdash; as if she\u2019s about to invite friends or plan her next party.

From her Greenwich Village studio, she traveled widely, including to the American West, Mexico, and Europe. However, it was her discovery in 1960 of Cranberry Island, an enchanting small island off Mount Desert and its vibrant community of artists, that was the beginning of Eisner's passion for Maine \u2013 a passion that lasted for 24 summers, until the very end of her life. Eisner relished involving herself in the local art scene. In New York, she exhibited broadly and worked tirelessly to further the careers of her fellow artists. Eisner's time on Cranberry was no different. She befriended and worked with many artists, including William Kienbusch, Carl Nelson, and John Heliker, all of whom summered on Cranberry Island. }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{Authority control }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eisner, Dorothy}}\n[[Category:1906 births]]\n[[Category:1984 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century American painters]]\n[[Category:Women painters]]\n[[Category:Artists from New York City]]\n", "name_user": "Delabrede", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eArtistic style", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Eisner"}
