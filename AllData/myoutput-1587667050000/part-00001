It is an active-duty associate unit administratively assigned to the [[495th Fighter Group]] and operates aircraft assigned to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]'s [[301st Fighter Wing]]. Prior to its reactivation in 2015, the unit's last assignment was that of a subordinate unit of the [[354th Fighter Wing]] based at [[Eielson Air Force Base]] in [[Alaska]], flying the Republic A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. The squadron was inactivated on 15 August 2007 as a result of [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) 2005.\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\nActivated on 15 November 1942 at [[Hamilton Air Force Base|Hamilton Field]], California, initially equipped with [[P-39 Airacobra]]s and assigned to [[IV Fighter Command]] for training. Moved to several bases in California and Nevada then to [[Portland Army Air Base]], Oregon in June 1943 and re-equipped with new [[North American P-51B Mustang]]s. Transitioned to the Mustang throughout the summer of 1943 the deployed to the [[European Theater of Operations]], being assigned to [[IX Fighter Command]] in England.\n\nIn late 1943, the strategic bombardment campaign over [[Occupied Europe]] and [[Nazi Germany]] being conducted by [[VIII Bomber Command]] was taking heavy losses in aircraft and flight crews as the [[VIII Fighter Command]]'s [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]]s and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s lacked the range to escort the heavy [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers deep into [[Germany]] to attack industrial and military targets. The P-51 had the range to perform the escort duties and the unit's operational control was transferred to Headquarters, [[Eighth Air Force]] to perform escort missions. From its base at [[RAF Boxted]], the unit flew long-range strategic escort missions with VIII Bomber Command groups, escorting the heavy bombers to targets such as Frankfurt, Leipzig, Augsburg, and Schweinfurt, engaging [[Luftwaffe]] day interceptors frequently, with the P-51s outperforming the German [[Bf 109]] and [[Fw 190]] interceptors, causing heavy losses to the Luftwaffe. Remained under operational control of Eighth Air Force until April 1944, when sufficient numbers of P-51D Mustangs and arrived from the United States and were assigned to VIII Fighter Command units for escort duty.\n\nWas relieved from escort duty and was re-equipped with P-47D Thunderbolts, and reassigned to [[RAF Lashenden]] on the southern coast of England.    Mission was redefined to provide tactical air support for the forthcoming invasion of France, to support the Third, and later Ninth United States Armies. Flew fighter sweeps over [[Normandy]] and along the [[English Channel]] coast of France and the Low Countries, April\u2013June 1944, then engaged in heavy tactical bombing of enemy military targets as well as roads, railroads and bridges in the Normandy area to support ground forces in the immediate aftermath of [[D-Day]].\n\n[[File:354fg-p51b.jpg|thumb|left|North American P-51B-1-NA Mustang Serial 43-12408 of the 355th Fighter Squadron, photo probably taken at RAF Boxted, England, early 1944.]]\nMoved to [[Advanced Landing Ground]]s in France beginning at the end of June 1944, moving eastwards to combat airfields and liberated French airports supporting Allied Ground forces as the advanced across Northern France.   Later, in 1944, the squadron became involved in dive-bombing and strafing missions, striking railroad yards, bridges, troop concentrations, and airfields.  Participated in attacks on German forces in Belgium in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], then moved eastward as part of the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]]. The squadron flew its last mission of the war on 7 May 1945 from the captured Luftwaffe airfield at [[Ansbach]] (R-45).\n\nRemained in Occupied Germany as part of the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] [[XII Tactical Air Command]] occupying force after the German Capitulation, being stationed at [[AAF Station Herzogenaurach]].  Was inactivated on 31 March 1946.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Cold War===\nReactivated by Tactical Air Command, United States Air Force on 19 November 1956, being assigned to the reactivated [[354th Fighter-Day Group]] at the new [[Myrtle Beach Air Force Base]], South Carolina.   Equipped with [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]] fighters, the squadron participated in exercises, operations, tests, and firepower demonstrations conducted by the [[Tactical Air Command]] within the US and abroad.  The unit frequently deployed to [[Aviano Air Base]], Italy and [[Wheelus Air Base]], Libya.  Was deployed to Europe during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]] and was moved to [[McCoy Air Force Base]], Florida in 1962 during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\n===Vietnam War===\n[[Image:F-100D-56-3374-355tfs-PhuCat.jpg|thumb|Former 355 TFS North American F-100D-80-NH \"Super Sabre\" 56-3374 on a mission into [[North Vietnam]] from Phu Cat AB, South Vietnam]]\n[[File:355th Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7D Formation over Southeast Asia.jpg|thumb|In-flight formation of 3 LTV A-7Ds (S/N 70-0967, 70-0983 and 71-296) of the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (Forward) deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand in December 1972.]]\n\nOn 3 February 1968 the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron was deployed to support the [[37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t Air Base]], South Vietnam for five months' Temporary Duty (TDY).\n\nAt the end of the TDY on 5 July, the 355 TFS was permanently assigned to the 37th, with activated New Jersey and [[District of Columbia]] [[Air National Guard]] personnel from the [[113th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at Myrtle Beach replacing them and manning the unit.\n\nOn 15 May 1969 with the reassignment of the [[612th Tactical Fighter Squadron|612th]] and [[174th Tactical Fighter Squadron]]s, it was decided to convert the 37th to a [[McDonnell F-4 Phantom II]] wing. The F-100 equipped 355th, along with the [[416th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] were reassigned to the [[31st Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Tuy Hoa Air Base]], replacing the Air National Guard [[136th Tactical Fighter Squadron|136th]] and [[188th Tactical Fighter Squadron]]s which were returning to New York and New Mexico, respectively.\n\nAt Tuy Hoa, the tail code of the 355th F-100s was changed to \"SP\", and deployed Air National Guard personnel from New York and New Mexico and regular Air Force personnel manned the 355th until its inactivation on 30 September 1970.\n\nDuring its time in Vietnam, the 355th flew more than 17,000 combat sorties flying close air support, interdiction, search and rescue, and helicopter support missions. The squadron was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. the [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]], and the [[Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross]] with Palm for its service.\n\nOn 1 November 1970, the 355 TFS was reactivated at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina as part of the [[354th Tactical Fighter Wing]].  Upon its return, the unit transitioned to the new [[LTV A-7D Corsair II]] aircraft before redeploying to Southeast Asia in the fall of 1972 as the first A-7 unit to fight there. In 10 weeks of combat before the end of that conflict, the squadron participated in the Linebacker II campaign, generated more than 4,000 sorties, and was credited with 22 rescues of downed airmen. The unit returned to Myrtle Beach in April 1974.\n\n===Post-Vietnam era===\n[[File:355th Tactical Fighter Squadron - Group Photo.jpg|thumb|355th Tactical Fighter Squadron Personnel \u2013 March 1991 \u2013 King Fahd International Airport after victory in Operation Desert Storm]]\nIn February 1978, the 355 FS transitioned to the new [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], a [[close air support]] aircraft, becoming the second operational squadron in the nation's first A-10 wing.\n\nDuty called again in August 1990 when the unit deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. There, the squadron's pilots inflicted heavy damage to Iraqi armor and artillery emplacements, helped cut off enemy supply lines, and conducted search and rescue missions. The squadron contributed greatly to the 4,200 artillery, tank and other vehicle kills credited to A-10s during the war.\n\n===Modern era===\nInactivated at Myrtle Beach on 31 March 1992, the 355 FS was reactivated on 20 August 1993, replacing the inactivating 11th Tactical Air Support Squadron at Eleison AFB, Alaska.  The unit's primary missions included air strike control, close air support, interdiction, joint air attack team, escort, and combat search and rescue.\n\nWith a dual role A/OA-10 Warthog squadron commitment and night vision goggles, the squadron had the ability to deploy forward air controllers with attack aircraft for a complete day and night employment capability.\n\n355 FS deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy from January 1996 to March 1997, supporting Operation Joint Guard.  No ordnance was employed, but pilots flew sorties and sat alert with combat loaded aircraft.\n\nThe 355th FS also provided air liaison officers for the 172d Stryker Brigade Combat, providing advice, as ground forward air controllers, on the use of fighters and the tactical employment of close air support assets.\n\nIn October 1998, the 355 FS deployed to support [[Operation Southern Watch]]. Only two months later, the Warthogs saw their second tour of combat duty over Iraq while participating in the 16\u201319 December 1998, [[Operation Desert Fox]] strike missions. In 2.5 months, the 355 FS flew 597 combat and combat support sorties leading up to, then conducting, National Command Authority directed strikes on Iraqi military facilities and suspected weapons of mass destruction storage areas. They achieved 100 percent target hit rate.\n\n[[Image:Eielson looks cold.jpg|thumb|An [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] of the 355th Fighter Squadron sits on the tarmac at Eielson before a mission, 2004]]\nThe unit deployed to [[Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base]], [[Kuwait]], in support of Operation Southern Watch, January\u2013March 2001. The 355 FS also exercised at [[Hurlburt Field]], [[Florida]], to train with Special Forces units, October 2003.\n\nIn Spring 2004 the unit deployed to [[Bagram Air Base]], Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  The unit redeployed there again early 2006.  During both deployments the unit was responsible to provide close air support to Army ground forces and convoys in Afghanistan.\n\n===Base realignment and closure===\nOn 13 May 2005, The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] proposed a major realignment of the base as part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|Base Realignment and Closure]] program. The A-10 aircraft were to be distributed to the [[917th Wing]] at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], Louisiana (three aircraft); to a new active-duty unit at [[Moody Air Force Base]], Georgia (12 aircraft); and to backup inventory (three aircraft).\n\nLt Col Quentin \"Q-Tip\" Rideout, 355th Fighter Squadron Commander, flew the last operational A-10 sortie at Eielson AFB on 31 July 2007.\n\nThe last three A-10 aircraft departed Eielson AFB on 15 August 2007.  Lt Col Kevin \"Crotch\" Blanchard flew 81-944, Capt Sean \"Shark\" Hall flew 79-172, and Capt Dale \"Porkchop\" Stark flew 80-259.  Although the aircraft were originally scheduled to depart at 0700, they were delayed until 0830 because of foggy conditions.  Lt Col Blanchard was the first to lift off, followed closely by Capt Hall. When Capt Stark took off, and shortly before disappearing into the clouds, he tipped the wings of his jet, a final farewell salute to Eielson AFB and the 355th Fighter Squadron.\n\n===Current operations===\nIn 2010, Detachment 457, a geographically separated unit of the [[20th Operations Group]] at [[Shaw Air Force Base]], South Carolina, stood up at [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth]], Texas. The unit oversaw the integration of over 130 active-duty [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] pilots and maintenance personnel into the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]'s [[301st Fighter Wing]] under the Total Force Initiative.<ref name=codeone>{{cite web |url= http://www.codeonemagazine.com/article.html?item_id=120 |last1=Boling|first1=B.J.|title=301st Fighter Wing \u2013 Total Force Integration|date=10 May 2013|publisher=Code One Magazine|url-status=live |accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> On 8 March 2013, the [[495th Fighter Group]] was stood up at Shaw as a dedicated unit overseeing ten active associate fighter units, including Detachment 457. On 5 October 2015, Detachment 457 discontinued and was replaced by the '''355th Fighter Squadron''', which reactivated the same day. It remains under administrative command of the 495th Fighter Group and flies and maintains F-16s assigned to the 301st's [[457th Fighter Squadron]] at Fort Worth.\n\n==Lineage==\n* Constituted as the '''355th Fighter Squadron''' on 12 November 1942\n: Activated on 15 November 1942\n: Redesignated '''355th Fighter Squadron''', Single Engine on 21 August 1944\n: Inactivated on 31 March 1946\n* Redesignated '''355th Fighter-Day Squadron''' on 28 September 1956\n: Activated on 19 November 1956\n: Redesignated '''355th Tactical Fighter Squadron''' on 1 July 1958\n: Inactivated on 30 September 1970\n* Activated on 1 November 1970\n: Redesignated '''355th Fighter Squadron''' on 1 November 1991\n: Inactivated on 31 March 1992\n* Activated on 20 August 1993\n: Inactivated on 15 August 2007\n* Activated on 5 October 2015<ref name=355FSfacts/>\n: Inactivated on 25 October 2019\n\n===Assignments===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* 354th Fighter Group, 15 November 1942 \u2013 31 March 1946\n* 354th Fighter-Day Group, 19 November 1956\n* 354th Fighter-Day Wing (later 354th Tactical Fighter Wing), 25 September 1957\n:: Attached to: [[Seventeenth Air Force]], 15 July \u2013 26 October 1958;

It is an active-duty associate unit administratively assigned to the [[495th Fighter Group]] and operates aircraft assigned to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]'s [[301st Fighter Wing]]. Prior to its reactivation in 2015, the unit's last assignment was that of a subordinate unit of the [[354th Fighter Wing]] based at [[Eielson Air Force Base]] in [[Alaska]], flying the Republic A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. The squadron was inactivated on 15 August 2007 as a result of [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) 2005.\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\nActivated on 15 November 1942 at [[Hamilton Air Force Base|Hamilton Field]], California, initially equipped with [[P-39 Airacobra]]s and assigned to [[IV Fighter Command]] for training. Moved to several bases in California and Nevada then to [[Portland Army Air Base]], Oregon in June 1943 and re-equipped with new [[North American P-51B Mustang]]s. Transitioned to the Mustang throughout the summer of 1943 the deployed to the [[European Theater of Operations]], being assigned to [[IX Fighter Command]] in England.\n\nIn late 1943, the strategic bombardment campaign over [[Occupied Europe]] and [[Nazi Germany]] being conducted by [[VIII Bomber Command]] was taking heavy losses in aircraft and flight crews as the [[VIII Fighter Command]]'s [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]]s and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s lacked the range to escort the heavy [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers deep into [[Germany]] to attack industrial and military targets. The P-51 had the range to perform the escort duties and the unit's operational control was transferred to Headquarters, [[Eighth Air Force]] to perform escort missions. From its base at [[RAF Boxted]], the unit flew long-range strategic escort missions with VIII Bomber Command groups, escorting the heavy bombers to targets such as Frankfurt, Leipzig, Augsburg, and Schweinfurt, engaging [[Luftwaffe]] day interceptors frequently, with the P-51s outperforming the German [[Bf 109]] and [[Fw 190]] interceptors, causing heavy losses to the Luftwaffe. Remained under operational control of Eighth Air Force until April 1944, when sufficient numbers of P-51D Mustangs and arrived from the United States and were assigned to VIII Fighter Command units for escort duty.\n\nWas relieved from escort duty and was re-equipped with P-47D Thunderbolts, and reassigned to [[RAF Lashenden]] on the southern coast of England.    Mission was redefined to provide tactical air support for the forthcoming invasion of France, to support the Third, and later Ninth United States Armies. Flew fighter sweeps over [[Normandy]] and along the [[English Channel]] coast of France and the Low Countries, April\u2013June 1944, then engaged in heavy tactical bombing of enemy military targets as well as roads, railroads and bridges in the Normandy area to support ground forces in the immediate aftermath of [[D-Day]].\n\n[[File:354fg-p51b.jpg|thumb|left|North American P-51B-1-NA Mustang Serial 43-12408 of the 355th Fighter Squadron, photo probably taken at RAF Boxted, England, early 1944.]]\nMoved to [[Advanced Landing Ground]]s in France beginning at the end of June 1944, moving eastwards to combat airfields and liberated French airports supporting Allied Ground forces as the advanced across Northern France.   Later, in 1944, the squadron became involved in dive-bombing and strafing missions, striking railroad yards, bridges, troop concentrations, and airfields.  Participated in attacks on German forces in Belgium in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], then moved eastward as part of the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]]. The squadron flew its last mission of the war on 7 May 1945 from the captured Luftwaffe airfield at [[Ansbach]] (R-45).\n\nRemained in Occupied Germany as part of the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] [[XII Tactical Air Command]] occupying force after the German Capitulation, being stationed at [[AAF Station Herzogenaurach]].  Was inactivated on 31 March 1946.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Cold War===\nReactivated by Tactical Air Command, United States Air Force on 19 November 1956, being assigned to the reactivated [[354th Fighter-Day Group]] at the new [[Myrtle Beach Air Force Base]], South Carolina.   Equipped with [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]] fighters, the squadron participated in exercises, operations, tests, and firepower demonstrations conducted by the [[Tactical Air Command]] within the US and abroad.  The unit frequently deployed to [[Aviano Air Base]], Italy and [[Wheelus Air Base]], Libya.  Was deployed to Europe during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]] and was moved to [[McCoy Air Force Base]], Florida in 1962 during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\n===Vietnam War===\n[[Image:F-100D-56-3374-355tfs-PhuCat.jpg|thumb|Former 355 TFS North American F-100D-80-NH \"Super Sabre\" 56-3374 on a mission into [[North Vietnam]] from Phu Cat AB, South Vietnam]]\n[[File:355th Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7D Formation over Southeast Asia.jpg|thumb|In-flight formation of 3 LTV A-7Ds (S/N 70-0967, 70-0983 and 71-296) of the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (Forward) deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand in December 1972.]]\n\nOn 3 February 1968 the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron was deployed to support the [[37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t Air Base]], South Vietnam for five months' Temporary Duty (TDY).\n\nAt the end of the TDY on 5 July, the 355 TFS was permanently assigned to the 37th, with activated New Jersey and [[District of Columbia]] [[Air National Guard]] personnel from the [[113th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at Myrtle Beach replacing them and manning the unit.\n\nOn 15 May 1969 with the reassignment of the [[612th Tactical Fighter Squadron|612th]] and [[174th Tactical Fighter Squadron]]s, it was decided to convert the 37th to a [[McDonnell F-4 Phantom II]] wing. The F-100 equipped 355th, along with the [[416th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] were reassigned to the [[31st Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Tuy Hoa Air Base]], replacing the Air National Guard [[136th Tactical Fighter Squadron|136th]] and [[188th Tactical Fighter Squadron]]s which were returning to New York and New Mexico, respectively.\n\nAt Tuy Hoa, the tail code of the 355th F-100s was changed to \"SP\", and deployed Air National Guard personnel from New York and New Mexico and regular Air Force personnel manned the 355th until its inactivation on 30 September 1970.\n\nDuring its time in Vietnam, the 355th flew more than 17,000 combat sorties flying close air support, interdiction, search and rescue, and helicopter support missions. The squadron was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. the [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]], and the [[Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross]] with Palm for its service.\n\nOn 1 November 1970, the 355 TFS was reactivated at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina as part of the [[354th Tactical Fighter Wing]].  Upon its return, the unit transitioned to the new [[LTV A-7D Corsair II]] aircraft before redeploying to Southeast Asia in the fall of 1972 as the first A-7 unit to fight there. In 10 weeks of combat before the end of that conflict, the squadron participated in the Linebacker II campaign, generated more than 4,000 sorties, and was credited with 22 rescues of downed airmen. The unit returned to Myrtle Beach in April 1974.\n\n===Post-Vietnam era===\n[[File:355th Tactical Fighter Squadron - Group Photo.jpg|thumb|355th Tactical Fighter Squadron Personnel \u2013 March 1991 \u2013 King Fahd International Airport after victory in Operation Desert Storm]]\nIn February 1978, the 355 FS transitioned to the new [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], a [[close air support]] aircraft, becoming the second operational squadron in the nation's first A-10 wing.\n\nDuty called again in August 1990 when the unit deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. There, the squadron's pilots inflicted heavy damage to Iraqi armor and artillery emplacements, helped cut off enemy supply lines, and conducted search and rescue missions. The squadron contributed greatly to the 4,200 artillery, tank and other vehicle kills credited to A-10s during the war.\n\n===Modern era===\nInactivated at Myrtle Beach on 31 March 1992, the 355 FS was reactivated on 20 August 1993, replacing the inactivating 11th Tactical Air Support Squadron at Eleison AFB, Alaska.  The unit's primary missions included air strike control, close air support, interdiction, joint air attack team, escort, and combat search and rescue.\n\nWith a dual role A/OA-10 Warthog squadron commitment and night vision goggles, the squadron had the ability to deploy forward air controllers with attack aircraft for a complete day and night employment capability.\n\n355 FS deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy from January 1996 to March 1997, supporting Operation Joint Guard.  No ordnance was employed, but pilots flew sorties and sat alert with combat loaded aircraft.\n\nThe 355th FS also provided air liaison officers for the 172d Stryker Brigade Combat, providing advice, as ground forward air controllers, on the use of fighters and the tactical employment of close air support assets.\n\nIn October 1998, the 355 FS deployed to support [[Operation Southern Watch]]. Only two months later, the Warthogs saw their second tour of combat duty over Iraq while participating in the 16\u201319 December 1998, [[Operation Desert Fox]] strike missions. In 2.5 months, the 355 FS flew 597 combat and combat support sorties leading up to, then conducting, National Command Authority directed strikes on Iraqi military facilities and suspected weapons of mass destruction storage areas. They achieved 100 percent target hit rate.\n\n[[Image:Eielson looks cold.jpg|thumb|An [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] of the 355th Fighter Squadron sits on the tarmac at Eielson before a mission, 2004]]\nThe unit deployed to [[Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base]], [[Kuwait]], in support of Operation Southern Watch, January\u2013March 2001. The 355 FS also exercised at [[Hurlburt Field]], [[Florida]], to train with Special Forces units, October 2003.\n\nIn Spring 2004 the unit deployed to [[Bagram Air Base]], Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  The unit redeployed there again early 2006.  During both deployments the unit was responsible to provide close air support to Army ground forces and convoys in Afghanistan.\n\n===Base realignment and closure===\nOn 13 May 2005, The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] proposed a major realignment of the base as part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|Base Realignment and Closure]] program. The A-10 aircraft were to be distributed to the [[917th Wing]] at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], Louisiana (three aircraft); to a new active-duty unit at [[Moody Air Force Base]], Georgia (12 aircraft); and to backup inventory (three aircraft).\n\nLt Col Quentin \"Q-Tip\" Rideout, 355th Fighter Squadron Commander, flew the last operational A-10 sortie at Eielson AFB on 31 July 2007.\n\nThe last three A-10 aircraft departed Eielson AFB on 15 August 2007.  Lt Col Kevin \"Crotch\" Blanchard flew 81-944, Capt Sean \"Shark\" Hall flew 79-172, and Capt Dale \"Porkchop\" Stark flew 80-259.  Although the aircraft were originally scheduled to depart at 0700, they were delayed until 0830 because of foggy conditions.  Lt Col Blanchard was the first to lift off, followed closely by Capt Hall. When Capt Stark took off, and shortly before disappearing into the clouds, he tipped the wings of his jet, a final farewell salute to Eielson AFB and the 355th Fighter Squadron.\n\n===Current operations===\nIn 2010, Detachment 457, a geographically separated unit of the [[20th Operations Group]] at [[Shaw Air Force Base]], South Carolina, stood up at [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth]], Texas. The unit oversaw the integration of over 130 active-duty [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] pilots and maintenance personnel into the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]'s [[301st Fighter Wing]] under the Total Force Initiative.<ref name=codeone>{{cite web |url= http://www.codeonemagazine.com/article.html?item_id=120 |last1=Boling|first1=B.J.|title=301st Fighter Wing \u2013 Total Force Integration|date=10 May 2013|publisher=Code One Magazine|url-status=live |accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> On 8 March 2013, the [[495th Fighter Group]] was stood up at Shaw as a dedicated unit overseeing ten active associate fighter units, including Detachment 457. On 5 October 2015, Detachment 457 discontinued and was replaced by the '''355th Fighter Squadron''', which reactivated the same day. It remains under administrative command of the 495th Fighter Group and flies and maintains F-16s assigned to the 301st's [[457th Fighter Squadron]] at Fort Worth.\n\n==Lineage==\n* Constituted as the '''355th Fighter Squadron''' on 12 November 1942\n: Activated on 15 November 1942\n: Redesignated '''355th Fighter Squadron''', Single Engine on 21 August 1944\n: Inactivated on 31 March 1946\n* Redesignated '''355th Fighter-Day Squadron''' on 28 September 1956\n: Activated on 19 November 1956\n: Redesignated '''355th Tactical Fighter Squadron''' on 1 July 1958\n: Inactivated on 30 September 1970\n* Activated on 1 November 1970\n: Redesignated '''355th Fighter Squadron''' on 1 November 1991\n: Inactivated on 31 March 1992\n* Activated on 20 August 1993\n: Inactivated on 15 August 2007\n* Activated on 5 October 2015<ref name=355FSfacts/>\n: Inactivated on 25 October 2019\n\n===Assignments===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* 354th Fighter Group, 15 November 1942 \u2013 31 March 1946\n* 354th Fighter-Day Group, 19 November 1956\n* 354th Fighter-Day Wing (later 354th Tactical Fighter Wing), 25 September 1957\n:: Attached to: [[Seventeenth Air Force]], 15 July \u2013 26 October 1958;
