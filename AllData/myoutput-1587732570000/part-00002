Each time his lock of hair touched the ground, there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared. The celestial deities were worried that if the dance continues, it would result in decimation of entire creations. They prayed to [[Vishnu]] for help, who appeared at this place. On seeing Vishnu, Shiva's anger was reduced and he requested Vishnu to appear in eleven forms like he did. On his request, Vishnu appeared in eleven different forms at Tirunangur. The eleven places where Vishnu appeared are believed to be where the eleven temples in Tirunangur are located.<ref name=\"R\">[[#R.|R. 2001]], pp. 470-1</ref>\n\n== The Temple ==\nThe temple complex has a single ''[[prakaram]]''(outer courtyard) and a single shrine.
