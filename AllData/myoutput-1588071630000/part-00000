In general, there are two types of scanner setups. In one setup, the X-ray source and detector are typically stationary during the scan while the sample/animal rotates. The second setup, much more like a clinical CT scanner, is gantry based where the animal/specimen is stationary in space while the X-ray tube and detector rotate around. These scanners are typically used for small animals (''[[in vivo]]'' scanners), biomedical samples, foods, microfossils, and other studies for which minute detail is desired.\n\nThe first X-ray microtomography system was conceived and built by Jim Elliott in the early 1980s. The first published X-ray microtomographic images were reconstructed slices of a small tropical snail, with pixel size about 50 micrometers.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1982.tb00376.x|pmid=7086891|title=X-ray microtomography|year=1982|last1=Elliott|first1=J. C.|last2=Dover|first2=S. D.|journal=Journal of Microscopy|volume=126|issue=2|pages=211\u2013213}}</ref>\n\n==Working principle==\n\n===Imaging system===\n\n====[[Fan beam reconstruction]]====\nThe fan-beam system is based on a one-dimensional (1D) X-ray detector and an electronic X-ray source, creating 2D [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] of the object. Typically used in human [[computed tomography]] systems.\n\n====[[Cone beam reconstruction]]====\nThe cone-beam system is based on a 2D X-ray detector ([[camera]]) and an electronic X-ray source, creating [[projection images]] that later will be used to reconstruct the image cross-sections.\n\n===Open/Closed systems===\n\n====Open X-ray system====\nIn an open system, X-rays may escape or leak out, thus the operator must stay behind a shield, have special protective clothing, or operate the scanner from a distance or a different room. Typical examples of these scanners are the human versions, or designed for big objects.\n\n====Closed X-ray system====\nIn a closed system, X-ray shielding is put around the scanner so the operator can put the scanner on a desk or special table. Although the scanner is shielded, care must be taken and the operator usually carries a dosimeter, since X-rays have a tendency to be absorbed by metal and then re-emitted like an antenna. Although a typical scanner will produce a relatively harmless volume of X-rays, repeated scannings in a short timeframe could pose a danger. Digital detectors with small pixel pitches and micro-focus x-ray tubes are usually employed to yield in high resolution images.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghani MU, Zhou Z, Ren L, Li Y, Zheng B, Yang K, Liu H | title = Investigation of spatial resolution characteristics of an in vivo micro computed tomography system | journal = Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment | volume = 807 | pages = 129\u2013136 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26640309 | pmc = 4668590 | doi = 10.1016/j.nima.2015.11.007 | bibcode = 2016NIMPA.807..129G }}</ref> \n \nClosed systems tend to become very heavy because lead is used to shield the X-rays. Therefore, the smaller scanners only have a small space for samples.\n\n==3D image reconstruction==\n\n===The principle===\nBecause microtomography scanners offer [[Isotropy|isotropic]], or near isotropic, resolution, display of images does not need to be restricted to the conventional axial images. Instead, it is possible for a software program to build a volume by 'stacking' the individual slices one on top of the other. The program may then display the volume in an alternative manner.\n\n===Image reconstruction software===\nFor X-ray microtomography, powerful open source software is available, such as the ASTRA toolbox.<ref name=\"ASTRAEM\">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Aarle W, Palenstijn WJ, De Beenhouwer J, Altantzis T, Bals S, Batenburg KJ, Sijbers J | title = The ASTRA Toolbox: A platform for advanced algorithm development in electron tomography | journal = Ultramicroscopy | volume = 157 | pages = 35\u201347 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26057688 | doi = 10.1016/j.ultramic.2015.05.002 | url = https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/23858 }}</ref><ref name=\"ASTRACT\">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Aarle W, Palenstijn WJ, Cant J, Janssens E, Bleichrodt F, Dabravolski A, De Beenhouwer J, Joost Batenburg K, Sijbers J | display-authors = 6 | title = Fast and flexible X-ray tomography using the ASTRA toolbox | journal = Optics Express | volume = 24 | issue = 22 | pages = 25129\u201325147 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27828452 | doi = 10.1364/OE.24.025129 | url = https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/24770 | bibcode = 2016OExpr..2425129V }}</ref> The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox of high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography, from 2009\u20132014 developed by [http://visielab.uantwerpen.be iMinds-Vision Lab], University of Antwerp and since 2014 jointly developed by iMinds-VisionLab, UAntwerpen and CWI, Amsterdam.\nThe toolbox supports parallel, fan, and cone beam, with highly flexible source/detector positioning. A large number of reconstruction algorithms are available, including FBP, ART, SIRT, SART, CGLS.\n\n===Volume rendering===\n[[Volume rendering]] is a technique used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set, as produced by a microtomography scanner. Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n\n===Image segmentation===\nWhere different structures have similar threshold density, it can become impossible to separate them simply by adjusting volume rendering parameters. The solution is called [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], a manual or automatic procedure that can remove the unwanted structures from the image.\n\n==Typical use==\n\n===[[Archaeology]]===\n* Reconstructing fire-damaged artifacts, such as the [[En-Gedi Scroll]]\n* Unpacking [[Clay tablet|cuneiform tablets]] wrapped in clay envelopes<ref name=\"archaeological_application_cuneiform\" /> and [[History of ancient numeral systems#Clay token|clay tokens]]\n\n===[[Biomedical]]===\n* Both [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]] small animal imaging\n* Human skin samples \n* Bone samples, ranging in size from rodents to human biopsies\n* Lung imaging using respiratory gating\n* Cardiovascular imaging using cardiac gating\n* Imaging of the human eye, ocular microstructures and tumors<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Enders C, Braig EM, Scherer K, Werner JU, Lang GK, Lang GE, Pfeiffer F, No\u00ebl P, Rummeny E, Herzen J | display-authors = 6 | title = Advanced Non-Destructive Ocular Visualization Methods by Improved X-Ray Imaging Techniques | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = e0170633 | date = 2017-01-27 | pmid = 28129364 | pmc = 5271321 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0170633 | bibcode = 2017PLoSO..1270633E }}</ref>\n* Tumor imaging (may require contrast agents)\n* Soft tissue imaging<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mizutani R, Suzuki Y | title = X-ray microtomography in biology | journal = Micron | volume = 43 | issue = 2\u20133 | pages = 104\u201315 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22036251 | doi = 10.1016/j.micron.2011.10.002 | arxiv = 1609.02263 }}</ref>\n* Insects<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van de Kamp T, Vagovi\u010d P, Baumbach T, Riedel A | title = A biological screw in a beetle's leg | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6038 | pages = 52 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21719669 | doi = 10.1126/science.1204245 | bibcode = 2011Sci...333...52V }}</ref>\n* Parasitology \u2013 migration of parasites,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bulantov\u00e1 J, Mach\u00e1\u010dek T, Pansk\u00e1 L, Krej\u010d\u00ed F, Karch J, J\u00e4hrling N, Saghafi S, Dodt HU, Hor\u00e1k P | display-authors = 6 | title = Trichobilharzia regenti (Schistosomatidae): 3D imaging techniques in characterization of larval migration through the CNS of vertebrates | journal = Micron | volume = 83 | pages = 62\u201371 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26897588 | doi = 10.1016/j.micron.2016.01.009 }}</ref> parasite morphology<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Noever|first=Christoph|last2=Keiler|first2=Jonas|last3=Glenner|first3=Henrik|date=2016-07-01|title=First 3D reconstruction of the rhizocephalan root system using MicroCT|journal=Journal of Sea Research|series=Ecology and Evolution of Marine Parasites and Diseases|volume=113|pages=58\u201364|doi=10.1016/j.seares.2015.08.002|bibcode=2016JSR...113...58N|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nagler C, Haug JT | title = Functional morphology of parasitic isopods: understanding morphological adaptations of attachment and feeding structures in Nerocila as a pre-requisite for reconstructing the evolution of Cymothoidae | journal = PeerJ | volume = 4 | pages = e2188 | date = 2016-01-01 | pmid = 27441121 | pmc = 4941765 | doi = 10.7717/peerj.2188 }}</ref>\n\n'''<big>[[Developmental biology]]</big>'''\n\n* Tracing the development of the extinct Tasmanian tiger during growth in the pouch<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newton AH, Spoutil F, Prochazka J, Black JR, Medlock K, Paddle RN, Knitlova M, Hipsley CA, Pask AJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Letting the 'cat' out of the bag: pouch young development of the extinct Tasmanian tiger revealed by X-ray computed tomography | journal = Royal Society Open Science | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 171914 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29515893 | pmc = 5830782 | doi = 10.1098/rsos.171914 | bibcode = 2018RSOS....571914N }}</ref>\n* Model and non-model organisms (elephants,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hautier L, Stansfield FJ, Allen WR, Asher RJ | title = Skeletal development in the African elephant and ossification timing in placental mammals | journal = Proceedings.

In general, there are two types of scanner setups. In one setup, the X-ray source and detector are typically stationary during the scan while the sample/animal rotates. The second setup, much more like a clinical CT scanner, is gantry based where the animal/specimen is stationary in space while the X-ray tube and detector rotate around. These scanners are typically used for small animals (''[[in vivo]]'' scanners), biomedical samples, foods, microfossils, and other studies for which minute detail is desired.\n\nThe first X-ray microtomography system was conceived and built by Jim Elliott in the early 1980s. The first published X-ray microtomographic images were reconstructed slices of a small tropical snail, with pixel size about 50 micrometers.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1982.tb00376.x|pmid=7086891|title=X-ray microtomography|year=1982|last1=Elliott|first1=J. C.|last2=Dover|first2=S. D.|journal=Journal of Microscopy|volume=126|issue=2|pages=211\u2013213}}</ref>\n\n==Working principle==\n\n===Imaging system===\n\n====[[Fan beam reconstruction]]====\nThe fan-beam system is based on a one-dimensional (1D) X-ray detector and an electronic X-ray source, creating 2D [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] of the object. Typically used in human [[computed tomography]] systems.\n\n====[[Cone beam reconstruction]]====\nThe cone-beam system is based on a 2D X-ray detector ([[camera]]) and an electronic X-ray source, creating [[projection images]] that later will be used to reconstruct the image cross-sections.\n\n===Open/Closed systems===\n\n====Open X-ray system====\nIn an open system, X-rays may escape or leak out, thus the operator must stay behind a shield, have special protective clothing, or operate the scanner from a distance or a different room. Typical examples of these scanners are the human versions, or designed for big objects.\n\n====Closed X-ray system====\nIn a closed system, X-ray shielding is put around the scanner so the operator can put the scanner on a desk or special table. Although the scanner is shielded, care must be taken and the operator usually carries a dosimeter, since X-rays have a tendency to be absorbed by metal and then re-emitted like an antenna. Although a typical scanner will produce a relatively harmless volume of X-rays, repeated scannings in a short timeframe could pose a danger. Digital detectors with small pixel pitches and micro-focus x-ray tubes are usually employed to yield in high resolution images.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghani MU, Zhou Z, Ren L, Li Y, Zheng B, Yang K, Liu H | title = Investigation of spatial resolution characteristics of an in vivo micro computed tomography system | journal = Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment | volume = 807 | pages = 129\u2013136 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26640309 | pmc = 4668590 | doi = 10.1016/j.nima.2015.11.007 | bibcode = 2016NIMPA.807..129G }}</ref> \n \nClosed systems tend to become very heavy because lead is used to shield the X-rays. Therefore, the smaller scanners only have a small space for samples.\n\n==3D image reconstruction==\n\n===The principle===\nBecause microtomography scanners offer [[Isotropy|isotropic]], or near isotropic, resolution, display of images does not need to be restricted to the conventional axial images. Instead, it is possible for a software program to build a volume by 'stacking' the individual slices one on top of the other. The program may then display the volume in an alternative manner.\n\n===Image reconstruction software===\nFor X-ray microtomography, powerful open source software is available, such as the ASTRA toolbox.<ref name=\"ASTRAEM\">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Aarle W, Palenstijn WJ, De Beenhouwer J, Altantzis T, Bals S, Batenburg KJ, Sijbers J | title = The ASTRA Toolbox: A platform for advanced algorithm development in electron tomography | journal = Ultramicroscopy | volume = 157 | pages = 35\u201347 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26057688 | doi = 10.1016/j.ultramic.2015.05.002 | url = https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/23858 }}</ref><ref name=\"ASTRACT\">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Aarle W, Palenstijn WJ, Cant J, Janssens E, Bleichrodt F, Dabravolski A, De Beenhouwer J, Joost Batenburg K, Sijbers J | display-authors = 6 | title = Fast and flexible X-ray tomography using the ASTRA toolbox | journal = Optics Express | volume = 24 | issue = 22 | pages = 25129\u201325147 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27828452 | doi = 10.1364/OE.24.025129 | url = https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/24770 | bibcode = 2016OExpr..2425129V }}</ref> The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox of high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography, from 2009\u20132014 developed by [http://visielab.uantwerpen.be iMinds-Vision Lab], University of Antwerp and since 2014 jointly developed by iMinds-VisionLab, UAntwerpen and CWI, Amsterdam.\nThe toolbox supports parallel, fan, and cone beam, with highly flexible source/detector positioning. A large number of reconstruction algorithms are available, including FBP, ART, SIRT, SART, CGLS.\n\n===Volume rendering===\n[[Volume rendering]] is a technique used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set, as produced by a microtomography scanner. Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n\n===Image segmentation===\nWhere different structures have similar threshold density, it can become impossible to separate them simply by adjusting volume rendering parameters. The solution is called [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], a manual or automatic procedure that can remove the unwanted structures from the image.\n\n==Typical use==\n\n===[[Archaeology]]===\n* Reconstructing fire-damaged artifacts, such as the [[En-Gedi Scroll]]\n* Unpacking [[Clay tablet|cuneiform tablets]] wrapped in clay envelopes<ref name=\"archaeological_application_cuneiform\" /> and [[History of ancient numeral systems#Clay token|clay tokens]]\n\n===[[Biomedical]]===\n* Both [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]] small animal imaging\n* Human skin samples \n* Bone samples, ranging in size from rodents to human biopsies\n* Lung imaging using respiratory gating\n* Cardiovascular imaging using cardiac gating\n* Imaging of the human eye, ocular microstructures and tumors<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Enders C, Braig EM, Scherer K, Werner JU, Lang GK, Lang GE, Pfeiffer F, No\u00ebl P, Rummeny E, Herzen J | display-authors = 6 | title = Advanced Non-Destructive Ocular Visualization Methods by Improved X-Ray Imaging Techniques | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = e0170633 | date = 2017-01-27 | pmid = 28129364 | pmc = 5271321 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0170633 | bibcode = 2017PLoSO..1270633E }}</ref>\n* Tumor imaging (may require contrast agents)\n* Soft tissue imaging<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mizutani R, Suzuki Y | title = X-ray microtomography in biology | journal = Micron | volume = 43 | issue = 2\u20133 | pages = 104\u201315 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22036251 | doi = 10.1016/j.micron.2011.10.002 | arxiv = 1609.02263 }}</ref>\n* Insects<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van de Kamp T, Vagovi\u010d P, Baumbach T, Riedel A | title = A biological screw in a beetle's leg | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6038 | pages = 52 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21719669 | doi = 10.1126/science.1204245 | bibcode = 2011Sci...333...52V }}</ref>\n* Parasitology \u2013 migration of parasites,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bulantov\u00e1 J, Mach\u00e1\u010dek T, Pansk\u00e1 L, Krej\u010d\u00ed F, Karch J, J\u00e4hrling N, Saghafi S, Dodt HU, Hor\u00e1k P | display-authors = 6 | title = Trichobilharzia regenti (Schistosomatidae): 3D imaging techniques in characterization of larval migration through the CNS of vertebrates | journal = Micron | volume = 83 | pages = 62\u201371 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26897588 | doi = 10.1016/j.micron.2016.01.009 }}</ref> parasite morphology<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Noever|first=Christoph|last2=Keiler|first2=Jonas|last3=Glenner|first3=Henrik|date=2016-07-01|title=First 3D reconstruction of the rhizocephalan root system using MicroCT|journal=Journal of Sea Research|series=Ecology and Evolution of Marine Parasites and Diseases|volume=113|pages=58\u201364|doi=10.1016/j.seares.2015.08.002|bibcode=2016JSR...113...58N|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nagler C, Haug JT | title = Functional morphology of parasitic isopods: understanding morphological adaptations of attachment and feeding structures in Nerocila as a pre-requisite for reconstructing the evolution of Cymothoidae | journal = PeerJ | volume = 4 | pages = e2188 | date = 2016-01-01 | pmid = 27441121 | pmc = 4941765 | doi = 10.7717/peerj.2188 }}</ref>\n\n'''<big>[[Developmental biology]]</big>'''\n\n* Tracing the development of the extinct Tasmanian tiger during growth in the pouch<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newton AH, Spoutil F, Prochazka J, Black JR, Medlock K, Paddle RN, Knitlova M, Hipsley CA, Pask AJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Letting the 'cat' out of the bag: pouch young development of the extinct Tasmanian tiger revealed by X-ray computed tomography | journal = Royal Society Open Science | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 171914 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29515893 | pmc = 5830782 | doi = 10.1098/rsos.171914 | bibcode = 2018RSOS....571914N }}</ref>\n* Model and non-model organisms (elephants,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hautier L, Stansfield FJ, Allen WR, Asher RJ | title = Skeletal development in the African elephant and ossification timing in placental mammals | journal = Proceedings.
