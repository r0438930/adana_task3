In many situations, social comparison bias is fairly self-explanatory.

One study involved the relationship between depression and [[social comparison]].{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309\u2013323}}  Thwaites and Dagnan, in \"Moderating variables in the relationship between social comparison and depression\", investigated the relationship between social comparison and depression utilizing an evolutionary framework.  Their hypothesis was that depression was an outcome from social comparisons that people carried out.  This study investigated the moderating effects on social comparison of the importance of comparison dimensions to the person, and of the perceived importance of the dimensions to other people.  What the researchers used to measure the depression in their participants was a [[self-esteem]] test called the Self Attributes Questionnaire created by Pelham and Swann in 1989.  The test consisted of 10-point [[Likert scale]] ratings on 10 individual social comparison dimensions (e.g. [[intelligence]], [[social skills]], [[Humour|sense of humor]]).  \"Questions were added to explore beliefs regarding the importance of social comparison dimensions.  Data were collected from a combined clinical sample and non-clinical sample of 174 people.\"{{Sfn|Thwaites|Dagnan|2004|pp=309\u2013323}}  They concluded that social comparison did have a relationship with depression based on the data that they collected.  More people that contributed in social comparisons had a higher level of depression than people that rarely used social comparison. It has been shown that there are two forms of comparison as it pertains to social comparison. There is upward comparison which relates to when we compare ourselves to others who seem better off or are better than us. In downward comparison, we tend to compare ourselves to those who are less than us. Whatever the case may be, this creates a competitive attitude from oneself. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://positivepsychology.com/social-comparison/|title=Social Comparison: An Unavoidable Upward Or Downward Spiral|date=2016-04-30|website=PositivePsychology.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Cognitive effects==\nOne major symptom that can occur with social comparison bias is the mental disorder of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].

Depression is the most common mental illness associated to social comparison bias.{{Sfn|Pyszczynski|Greenberg|1987|pp=122\u2013138}}  Depression has a biological explanation to why people lose hope in life.  It is caused by the brain because of the [[hippocampus]] decreasing in size and the lowering levels of [[serotonin]] that circulates through the brain.{{Sfn|Nolen-Hoeksema|Morrow|1993|pp=561\u2013570}}  Another negative symptom that is associated to social comparison bias is [[suicide ideation]].  \"Suicide ideation can be defined as the constant thoughts about [[suicide]] and suicide attempts.  Suicide is the taking of one's own life.\"{{Sfn|Taylor|Lobel|1989|pp=569\u2013575}}  Suicide ideation can occur due to social comparison bias because people that compare themselves to people that are seen better than themselves get mentally discouraged because they believe they can not perform or look a certain way which causes low self-esteem.  Low self-esteem is one of the main factors in suicide ideation.{{Sfn|Garcia|Song|Tesser|2010|pp=97\u2013101}} Additionally, with social comparison bias, one can experience an increased sense of [[anxiety]]. This can be anxiety due to many things such as their own progress in life. This anxiety can only manifest in the sense of being anxious to log on to social media and see posts, but can then turn into social anxiety when seeing those on social media in person.

This being said, social networks such as [[Facebook]] makes viewing someone's daily life as simple as sending a request.  Society is exposed to everyone's lives and people are starting to compare themselves with their friends that they have on Facebook.  It is easy to log in and see someone brag about their success or their new belongings and feel bad about yourself.  In recent studies, researchers have been linking Facebook with depression in this generation of social media.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}}  They may start to have low self-esteem by seeing their friends online have more exciting lives and more popularity. This social comparison bias among social network users online can make people start to think of their lives as not as fulfilling as they want to be. They see pictures or statuses about job promotions or new jobs, vacations; new relationships, fun outings or even those that can afford nice things. This can cognitively affect people's [[self-esteem]] and cause depression.{{Sfn|Pappas|2012}} They can start to feel bad about their appearance and their life in general. Social media influences the number of social comparisons people have.{{Sfn|Kendler|Karkowski-Shuman|1997|pp=539\u2013547}} One study found that the more time users spend on Facebook each week, the more likely they are to think that others were happier and having better lives than they themselves.<ref>{{Hui-Tzu Grace Chou and Nicholas Edge.

Students depending on their grade level are very [[Competition|competitive]] about the grades they receive compared to their peers.  Social comparisons not only influence students' self-concepts but also improve their performance.<ref name=\"M\u00f6oller 2006\">M\u00f6oller 2006</ref>  This social comparison process leads to a lower self-concept when the class level is high and to a higher self-concept when the class level is low.<ref name=\"M\u00f6oller 2006\" />  Therefore, two students with equal performance in a domain may develop different [[self-concept]]s when they belong to different classes with different performance levels.<ref name=\"Wood 1989\" />  Social comparisons are important and valid predictors of students' self-evaluations and achievement behavior.  Students may feel jealousy or [[Competition|competitiveness]] when it comes to grades and getting into better colleges and universities than their peers.  Social comparison can also motivate students to do well because they want to keep along with their peers.\n\n==Conclusion==\n{{POV section|date=June 2016}}\nSocial comparison bias can occur in people's everyday life.  Whether it is on social networking sites, in the media, in society regarding wealth and [[social status]] or in the school system.  It can be negative to one's mental health due to the increasing risks of depression, suicide ideation and other mental disorders.{{Sfn|Kendler|1995|pp=5\u20139}}  Social comparison in this generation is everywhere and society revolves around comparing ourselves to each other if it is to have a higher self-esteem or to try and better themselves as a whole.  With social comparison being so important, it will lead to social comparison bias and cause negative effects in a person's life.  With the research found, the hypothesis was proven correct stating that depression does have a relationship with the social comparison that people in society participate in.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Social comparison theory]]\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n;Sources\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite journal |last1=Burson |first1=A. |last2=Larrick |first2=R |last3=Soll |first3=J. |year=2005 |title=Social Comparison and Confidence: When Thinking You're Better than Average Predicts Overconfidence |journal=Ross School of Business |issue=Paper No. 1016 |hdl=2027.42/41218 |ref=harv}} Published as:<br/>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.10.002|title=Social comparison and confidence: When thinking you're better than average predicts overconfidence (and when it does not)|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=102|issue=1|pages=76\u201394|year=2007|last1=Larrick|first1=Richard P.|last2=Burson|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Soll|first3=Jack B.|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Garcia |first1=S. |last2=Song |first2=H. |last3=Tesser |first3=A. |year=2010 |title=Tainted recommendations: The social comparison bias |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=97\u2013101 |doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.06.002 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~smgarcia/pubs/Social%20Comparison%20Bias.pdf |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418191234/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~smgarcia/pubs/Social%20Comparison%20Bias.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-18 }}\n*{{Cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Huguet |first1=P. |last2=Dumas |first2=F. |last3=Monteil |first3=J. |last4=Genestoux |first4=N. |year=2001 |title=Social comparison choices in the classroom: further evidence for students' upward comparison tendency and its beneficial impact on performance |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=557\u2013578 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.81}}\n*{{Cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Kaplan |first1=A. |last2=Haenlein |first2=M. |year=2010 |title=Users of the world, unite!

It is easy to log in and see someone brag about their success or their new belongings and feel bad about yourself.  In recent studies, researchers have been linking Facebook with depression in this generation of social media.{{Sfn|Kaplan|Haenlein|2010|pp=59\u201368}}  They may start to have low self-esteem by seeing their friends online have more exciting lives and more popularity. This social comparison bias among social network users online can make people start to think of their lives as not as fulfilling as they want to be. They see pictures or statuses about job promotions or new jobs, vacations; new relationships, fun outings or even those that can afford nice things. This can cognitively affect people's [[self-esteem]] and cause depression.{{Sfn|Pappas|2012}} They can start to feel bad about their appearance and their life in general. Social media influences the number of social comparisons people have.{{Sfn|Kendler|Karkowski-Shuman|1997|pp=539\u2013547}} One study found that the more time users spend on Facebook each week, the more likely they are to think that others were happier and having better lives than they themselves.<ref>{{Hui-Tzu Grace Chou and Nicholas Edge.

Students depending on their grade level are very [[Competition|competitive]] about the grades they receive compared to their peers.  Social comparisons not only influence students' self-concepts but also improve their performance.<ref name=\"M\u00f6oller 2006\">M\u00f6oller 2006</ref>  This social comparison process leads to a lower self-concept when the class level is high and to a higher self-concept when the class level is low.<ref name=\"M\u00f6oller 2006\" />  Therefore, two students with equal performance in a domain may develop different [[self-concept]]s when they belong to different classes with different performance levels.<ref name=\"Wood 1989\" />  Social comparisons are important and valid predictors of students' self-evaluations and achievement behavior.  Students may feel jealousy or [[Competition|competitiveness]] when it comes to grades and getting into better colleges and universities than their peers.  Social comparison can also motivate students to do well because they want to keep along with their peers.\n\n==Conclusion==\n{{POV section|date=June 2016}}\nSocial comparison bias can occur in people's everyday life.  Whether it is on social networking sites, in the media, in society regarding wealth and [[social status]] or in the school system.  It can be negative to one's mental health due to the increasing risks of depression, suicide ideation and other mental disorders.{{Sfn|Kendler|1995|pp=5\u20139}}  Social comparison in this generation is everywhere and society revolves around comparing ourselves to each other if it is to have a higher self-esteem or to try and better themselves as a whole.  With social comparison being so important, it will lead to social comparison bias and cause negative effects in a person's life.  With the research found, the hypothesis was proven correct stating that depression does have a relationship with the social comparison that people in society participate in.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Social comparison theory]]\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n;Sources\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite journal |last1=Burson |first1=A. |last2=Larrick |first2=R |last3=Soll |first3=J. |year=2005 |title=Social Comparison and Confidence: When Thinking You're Better than Average Predicts Overconfidence |journal=Ross School of Business |issue=Paper No. 1016 |hdl=2027.42/41218 |ref=harv}} Published as:<br/>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.10.002|title=Social comparison and confidence: When thinking you're better than average predicts overconfidence (and when it does not)|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=102|issue=1|pages=76\u201394|year=2007|last1=Larrick|first1=Richard P.|last2=Burson|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Soll|first3=Jack B.|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Garcia |first1=S. |last2=Song |first2=H. |last3=Tesser |first3=A. |year=2010 |title=Tainted recommendations: The social comparison bias |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=97\u2013101 |doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.06.002 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~smgarcia/pubs/Social%20Comparison%20Bias.pdf |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418191234/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~smgarcia/pubs/Social%20Comparison%20Bias.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-18 }}\n*{{Cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Huguet |first1=P. |last2=Dumas |first2=F. |last3=Monteil |first3=J. |last4=Genestoux |first4=N. |year=2001 |title=Social comparison choices in the classroom: further evidence for students' upward comparison tendency and its beneficial impact on performance |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=557\u2013578 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.81}}\n*{{Cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Kaplan |first1=A. |last2=Haenlein |first2=M. |year=2010 |title=Users of the world, unite!
