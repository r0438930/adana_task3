He attended [[Cleveland Heights High School]] where he was an excellent student and was active in American football, basketball, and track; he was class president for three years. Sheppard met his future wife, Marilyn Reese, while in high school. Although several small Ohio colleges offered him athletic scholarships, Sheppard chose to follow the lead of his father and older brothers and pursued a career in [[osteopathic medicine]]. He enrolled at [[Hanover College]] in [[Indiana]] to study pre-osteopathic medical courses, then took supplementary courses at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland. Sheppard finished his medical education at the  Los Angeles Osteopathic School of Physicians and Surgeons (now University of California Irvine) and was awarded the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O) degree.\n\nHe completed his internship and a residency in Neurosurgery at [[Los Angeles County General Hospital]]. A few years after marrying Marilyn Reese on February 21, 1945, in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Sheppard returned to Ohio and joined his father's growing medical practice at [[Bay View Hospital]].\n\n== Murder of Marilyn Reese Sheppard ==\nOn the night of July 3, 1954, Sheppard and Marilyn were entertaining neighbors at their lakefront home (demolished in 1993)<ref>\n{{cite news |title=The Dr. Sam Sheppard House Revisited |date=July 4, 2014 |accessdate=February 18, 2016 |publisher=The Village Newspaper\n|url=http://www.thevillagernewspaper.com/2014/07/17/the-dr-sam-sheppard-house-revisited/\n}}</ref> on Lake Erie at 28944 Lake Road<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofbayvillage.com/history/qa.cfm#8 |title=History Q & A: Where was the Sam Sheppard house? |publisher=The City of Bay Village |year=2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011228065104/http://www.cityofbayvillage.com/history/qa.cfm#8 |archivedate=2001-12-28}}</ref> in [[Bay Village, Ohio]], a suburb of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], just west of the city. The property itself abutted the shore of [[Lake Erie]], near the west end of Huntington Reservation.  While they were watching the movie ''[[Strange Holiday (1946 film)|Strange Holiday]]'', Sheppard fell asleep on the daybed in the living room. Marilyn walked the neighbors out.\n\nIn the early morning hours of July 4, 1954, Marilyn Sheppard was bludgeoned to death in her bed with an unknown instrument. The bedroom was covered with blood spatter and drops of blood were found on floors throughout the house. Some items from the house, including Sam Sheppard's wristwatch, keychain and key, and fraternity ring, appeared to have been stolen.<ref name=QofEvidence/>  They were later found in a canvas bag in shrubbery behind the house.<ref name=QofEvidence>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Colin |title=A Question of Evidence: The Casebook of Great Forensic Controversies, from Napoleon to O.

When he awoke, he saw the person downstairs, chased the intruder out of the house down to the beach where they tussled and Sheppard was knocked unconscious again.\n\nAt 5:40 am, a neighbor received an urgent phone call from Sheppard who pleaded for him to come to his home. When the neighbor and his wife arrived, Sheppard was found shirtless and his pants were wet with a bloodstain on the knee. Authorities arrived shortly thereafter. Sheppard seemed disoriented and in shock.<ref>{{cite book |last=Neff |first=James |year=2001 |title=The Wrong Man |url=https://archive.org/details/wrongmanfinalver00neff |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Random House |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wrongmanfinalver00neff/page/5 5\u20139]}}</ref> The family dog was not heard barking to indicate an intruder, and their seven-year-old son, Sam Reese \"Chip\" Sheppard, was asleep in the adjacent bedroom during the whole ordeal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/26/us/after-life-of-notoriety-and-pain-son-tries-to-solve-his-mother-smurder.html|last=Butterfield|first=Fox|title=After Life of Notoriety and Pain, Son Tries to Solve His Mother's Murder|work=The New York Times|date=March 26, 1996|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== First trial ==\nSheppard's trial began October 18, 1954.\n\n=== Media ===\nThe murder investigation and the trial were notable for the extensive publicity. Some newspapers and other media in [[Ohio]] were accused of bias against Sheppard and inflammatory coverage of the case, and were criticized for immediately labeling him the only viable suspect. A federal judge later criticized the media, \"If ever there was a trial by newspaper, this is a perfect example. And the most insidious example was the ''[[Cleveland Press]]''. For some reason that newspaper took upon itself the role of accuser, judge and jury.\"<ref>Neff 2001, p. 230</ref>\n\nIt appeared that the local media influenced the investigators. On July 21, 1954, the ''Cleveland Press'' ran a front-page editorial titled \"Do It Now, Dr. Gerber\" which called for a public [[inquest]]. Hours later, Dr. Samuel Gerber, the coroner investigating the murder, announced that he would hold an inquest the next day.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 85</ref> The ''Cleveland Press'' ran another front-page editorial titled \"Why Isn't Sam Sheppard in Jail?\" on July 30 which was titled in later editions, \"Quit Stalling and Bring Him In!\".<ref>[http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/gvpt339/sheppard.html The Sam Sheppard Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040907234728/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/gvpt339/sheppard.html |date=September 7, 2004 }}, umd.edu; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/2001-11-08-wrong-man.htm|work=USA Today|title='Wrong Man' makes case for Sheppard's innocence|date=November 8, 2001|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> That night, Sheppard was arrested for a police interrogation.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 101-02</ref>\n\nThe local media ran salacious front-page stories inflammatory to Sheppard which had no supporting facts or were later disproved. During the trial, a popular radio show broadcast a report about a New York City woman who claimed to be his mistress and the mother of his illegitimate child. Since the jury was not [[jury sequestration|sequestered]], two of the jurors admitted to the judge that they heard the broadcast but the judge did not dismiss them.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 151-52</ref> From interviews with some of the jurors years later, it is likely that jurors were contaminated by the press before the trial and perhaps during it.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 166-68</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court later called the trial a \"carnival atmosphere\".<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=384&invol=333 ''Sheppard v. Maxwell''], 384 U.S. 333, 358 (1964) (U.S. Supreme Court)</ref>\n\n===Prosecution's theory===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe high-profile nature of the case proved to be a boon to lead prosecutor John J. Mahon, who was running for a seat on the [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] as the trial began. Mahon won his seat, and served until his death on January 31, 1962.\n\nProsecutors learned during their investigation and revealed at trial that Sheppard had carried on a three-year-long extramarital affair with Susan Hayes, a [[nurse]] at the hospital where Sheppard was employed. The prosecution argued that the affair was Sheppard's motive for killing his wife. Mahon made the most of the case in the absence of any direct evidence against the defendant, other than that he was inside the house when Marilyn Sheppard was killed. Mahon emphasized the inconsistencies in Sam Sheppard's story and that he could not give an accurate description of the intruder in his house.\n\nOther issues brought up at trial involved why there was no sand in his hair when Sheppard claimed to have been sprawled at the beach, and Sheppard's missing T-shirt, which the prosecutor speculated would or should contain some of Sheppard's blood (having been in an alleged struggle with the perpetrator). However, Prosecutor Mahon chose to make these assertions despite no T-shirt ever being found or presented as evidence. Also, part of the prosecution's case centered around (speculative) questions like why a burglar would first take the belongings in the canvas bag, only to later ditch them in bushes outside the Sheppard home.  It was under these circumstances that Mahon openly speculated Sheppard had staged the crime scene.\n\nLack of a murder weapon posed problems for the prosecution, but Cuyahoga County Coroner Samuel R. Gerber nearly circumvented this discrepancy by testifying that a blood imprint found on the pillow beneath Marilyn Sheppard's head was made by a \"two-blade surgical instrument with teeth at the end of each blade\" such as a scalpel. Inexplicably, Sheppard's lawyers left this vague assertion unchallenged. Sheppard's lawyer was denied access to the physical evidence by the judge and therefore could not argue any assertions as to blood droplets, murder weapon marks, blood spatter, physical marks on the body, etc.\n\n===Defense strategy===\nSheppard's attorney, William Corrigan, argued that Sheppard had severe injuries and that these injuries were inflicted by the intruder. Corrigan based his argument on the report made by neurosurgeon Dr. Charles Elkins, M.D., who examined Sheppard and found he had suffered a cervical concussion, nerve injury, many absent or weak reflexes (most notably on the left side of his body), and injury in the region of the second cervical vertebra in the back of the neck. Dr. Elkins stated that it was impossible to fake or simulate the missing reflex responses.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe defense further argued the crime scene was extremely bloody, yet the only blood evidence appearing on Sheppard was a bloodstain on his trousers. Corrigan also argued two of Marilyn's teeth had been broken and that the pieces had been pulled from her mouth, suggesting she had possibly bitten her assailant. He told the jury that Sheppard had no open wounds. (Some{{who|date=February 2013}} observers have questioned the accuracy of claims that Marilyn Sheppard lost her teeth while biting her attacker, arguing that her missing teeth are more consistent with the severe beating Marilyn Sheppard received to her face and skull.<ref name=cnn>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9910/05/sheppard.case|title=Body of Sam Sheppard's wife exhumed in Ohio|date=October 5, 1999|publisher=CNN.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040919212714/http://edition.cnn.com/US/9910/05/sheppard.case|archivedate=2004-09-19}}</ref>) However, as criminologist [[Paul L. Kirk]] later pointed out, if the beating had broken Mrs. Sheppard's teeth, pieces would have been found inside her mouth, and her lips would have been severely damaged, which was not the case.<ref>Affidavit of Paul L. Kirk, filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Branch, No. 64571</ref>\n\nSheppard took the stand in his own defense, testifying that he had been sleeping downstairs on a daybed when he awoke to his wife's screams.\n\n{{quote|I think that she cried or screamed my name once or twice, during which time I ran upstairs, thinking that she might be having a reaction similar to convulsions that she had in the early days of her pregnancy. I charged into our room and saw a form with a light garment, I believe, at that time grappling with something or someone. During this short period I could hear loud moans or groaning sounds and noises. I was struck down. It seems like I was hit from behind somehow but had grappled this individual from in front or generally in front of me. I was apparently knocked out. The next thing I knew, I was gathering my senses while coming to a sitting position next to the bed, my feet toward the hallway. ... I looked at my wife, I believe I took her pulse and felt that she was gone. I believe that I thereafter instinctively or subconsciously ran into my youngster's room next door and somehow determined that he was all right, I am not sure how I determined this. After that, I thought that I heard a noise downstairs, seemingly in the front eastern portion of the house.<ref>{{cite book|last1=DeSario|first1=Jack|last2=Mason|first2=William D.|title=Dr. Sam Sheppard on Trial: The Prosecutors and the Marilyn Sheppard Murder|year=2003|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=0-873-38770-8|page=345}}</ref>}}\n\nSheppard ran back downstairs and chased what he described as a \"bushy-haired intruder\" or \"form\" down to the [[Lake Erie]] beach below his home, before being knocked out again.

On July 30, 1961, Corrigan died and [[F. Lee Bailey]] took over as Sheppard's chief counsel. Bailey's petition for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' was granted on July 15, 1964, by a [[United States district court]] judge who called the 1954 trial a \"mockery of justice\" that shredded Sheppard's Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process.

Maxwell]]''. On June 6, 1966, the Supreme Court, by an 8-to-1 vote, struck down the murder conviction. The decision noted, among other factors, that a \"carnival atmosphere\" had permeated the trial, and that the trial judge, [[Edward J. Blythin]],<ref name=statement>{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/sheppard_trial/media.htm |title=The Media and the Trial |publisher=Providence.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613195225/http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/sheppard_trial/media.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> who had died in 1958, was biased against Sheppard because Judge Blythin had refused to sequester the [[jury]], did not order the jury to ignore and disregard media reports of the case, and when speaking to newspaper columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] shortly before the trial started said, \"Well, he's guilty as hell.  There's no question about it.\"\n\nSheppard served ten years of his sentence. Three days after his 1964 release, he married Ariane Tebbenjohanns, a German divorcee who had corresponded with him during his imprisonment. The two had been engaged since January 1963. Tebbenjohanns endured her own bit of controversy shortly after the engagement had been announced, confirming that her half-sister was [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Ritschel]], the wife of [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda]] chief [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Tebbenjohanns emphasized that she held no Nazi views. On October 7, 1969, Sheppard and Tebbenjohanns divorced.<ref>[http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/sheppard/timeline_ctv.html Court TV Online \u2013 Sheppard]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514003333/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/sheppard/timeline_ctv.html |date=May 14, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n=== Retrial ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\nJury selection began October 24, 1966, and opening statements began eight days later.

Terry Gilbert, an [[Lawyer|attorney]] retained by the Sheppard family, told the media that \"the [[fetus]] in this case had previously been [[autopsy|autopsied]]\", a fact that had never previously been disclosed. This, Gilbert argued, raised questions about the coroner's office in the original case possibly concealing pertinent evidence.<ref name=cnn/> Due to the passage of time and the effect of [[formaldehyde]] on the fetus's tissues, paternity could not be established.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Richard Eberling===\nDuring the civil trial, plaintiff attorney Terry Gilbert contended that Richard Eberling, an occasional handyman and window washer at the Sheppard home, was the likeliest suspect in Marilyn's murder. Eberling found Marilyn attractive and he was very familiar with the layout of the Sheppard home.<ref>Linder, Douglas O., [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/sheppard/eberlinginfo.html \u201cDr. Sam Sheppard Trials\u201d], University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref>\n\nIn 1959, detectives were questioning Richard Eberling on various burglaries in the area. Eberling confessed to the burglaries and showed the detectives his loot, which included two rings that belonged to Marilyn Sheppard. Eberling stole the rings in 1958, a few years after the murder, from Sam Sheppard's brother's house, taken from a box marked \"Personal Property of Marilyn Sheppard\".<ref>Cleveland Police Department, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/plaintiff_exhibits_2000/113 \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 0022: Eberling Statement\" (1959)], Sheppard 2000 Trial Plaintiff's Exhibits. Book 113.</ref> In subsequent questioning, Eberling admitted his blood was at the crime scene of Marilyn Sheppard. He stated that he cut his finger while washing windows just prior to the murder and bled while on the premises.<ref>Tompkins, James R., \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 0020: Bay Village Police Report re: Eberling\" (1988). Sheppard 2000 Trial Plaintiff's Exhibits. Book 114. http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/plaintiff_exhibits_2000/114</ref> As part of the investigation, Eberling took a polygraph test with questions about the murder of Marilyn. The polygraph examiner concluded that Eberling did not show deception in his answers, although the polygraph results were evaluated by other experts years later who found that it was either inconclusive or Eberling was deceptive.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 212, 352</ref>\n\nIn his testimony in the 2000 civil lawsuit, Bailey stated that he rejected Eberling as a suspect in 1966 because \"I thought he passed a good polygraph test.\" When it was presented to Bailey that an independent polygraph expert said Eberling either murdered Marilyn or had knowledge of who did, Bailey stated that he probably would have presented Eberling as a suspect in the 1966 retrial.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 351-52</ref>\n\n[[DNA]] evidence, which was not available in the two murder trials, played an important role in the civil trial. DNA analysis of blood at the crime scene showed that there was presence of blood from a third person, other than Marilyn and Dr. Sam Sheppard.<ref>Chakarborty, Ranajit, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_dna/17 \"Chakraborty Report on DNA Typing Involving Richard Eberling, Sam Sheppard, and Marilyn Sheppard\" (2000)],. Blood Evidence and DNA \u2013 Sam Sheppard Case. Book 17.</ref>\n\nWith regard to tying the blood to Eberling, the DNA analysis that was allowed to be admitted to the trial was inconclusive. A plaintiff DNA expert was 90% confident that one of the blood spots belonged to Richard Eberling but, according to the rules of the court, this was not admissible. The defense argued that the blood evidence had been tainted in the years since it was collected, and that an important blood spot on the closet door in Marilyn Sheppard's room potentially included 83% of the adult white population. The defense also pointed out that the results in 1955 from the older blood typing technique, that the blood collected from the closet door was Type O, while Eberling's [[ABO blood group system|blood type]] was Type A.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 364-367</ref>\n\nThroughout his life, Richard Eberling was associated with women who had suspicious deaths and he was convicted of murdering Ethel May Durkin, a wealthy, elderly widow who died without any immediate family. Durkin's 1984 murder in [[Lakewood, Ohio]], was uncovered when a court-appointed review of the woman's estate revealed that Eberling, Durkin's guardian and executor, had failed to execute her final wishes, which included stipulations on her burial.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nDurkin's body was exhumed and additional injuries were discovered in the autopsy that did not match Eberling's previous claims of in-house accidents, including a fall down a staircase in her home.  In subsequent legal action, both Eberling and his partner, Obie Henderson, were found guilty in Durkin's death. Coincidentally, both of Durkin's sisters, Myrtle Fray and Sarah Belle Farrow, had died under suspicious circumstances as well. Fray was killed after being \"savagely\" beaten about the head and face and then strangled; Farrow died following a fall down the basement steps in the home she shared with Durkin in 1970, a fall in which she broke both legs and both arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlthough Eberling denied any criminal involvement in the murder of Marilyn Sheppard,<ref>[http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/famouspeople/a/sheppard.htm Sam Sheppard Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917234853/http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/famouspeople/a/sheppard.htm |date=September 17, 2005 }}, columbusoh.about.com; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref> Kathy Wagner Dyal, who worked alongside Eberling in caring for Ethel May Durkin, also testified that Eberling had confessed to her in 1983.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 298</ref> A fellow convict also reported that Eberling confessed to the crime. The defense called into question the credibility of both witnesses during the 2000 civil trial. Eberling died in an Ohio prison in 1998, where he was serving a [[life sentence]] for the 1984 murder of Ethel May Durkin.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Defense===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nSteve Dever led the defense trial team for the State of Ohio, which included assistant prosecutors Dean Maynard Boland and Kathleen Martin. They argued that Sheppard was the most logical suspect, and presented expert testimony suggesting that Marilyn Sheppard's murder was a textbook domestic [[homicide]]. They argued that Sheppard had not welcomed the news of his wife's pregnancy, he wanted to continue his affairs with Susan Hayes and with other women, and he was concerned about the [[social stigma]] that a divorce might create.  They claimed the evidence showed that Marilyn Sheppard may have hit Sam Sheppard, sparking an angry rage that resulted in her bludgeoning. Boland evaluated evidence that had been considered by fifty years of investigators, journalists and others, and during the trial he was the first to suggest that the murder weapon used by Sam Sheppard was a bedroom lamp.\n\nThe defense asked why Sheppard had not called out for help, why he had neatly folded his jacket on the daybed in which he said he had fallen asleep, and why the family dog, which several witnesses had testified (in the first trial in 1954) was very loud when strangers came to the house, had not barked on the night of the murder (implying that the dog knew the killer).\n\n===Verdict===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nAfter ten weeks of trial, 76 witnesses, and hundreds of exhibits, the case went to the eight-person civil jury. The jury deliberated just three hours on April 12, 2000, before returning a unanimous [[verdict]] that Samuel Reese Sheppard had failed to prove that his father had been wrongfully imprisoned.\n\n===Invalidation of wrongful imprisonment claim===\nOn February 22, 2002, the [[Ohio District Courts of Appeals|Eighth District Court of Appeals]] ruled unanimously that the civil case should not have gone to the jury, on the grounds that the [[statute of limitations]] had expired, and that a claim for wrongful imprisonment abated with Sam Sheppard's death.<ref>''[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_court_filings_2000/2 Murray v.

He attended [[Cleveland Heights High School]] where he was an excellent student and was active in American football, basketball, and track; he was class president for three years. Sheppard met his future wife, Marilyn Reese, while in high school. Although several small Ohio colleges offered him athletic scholarships, Sheppard chose to follow the lead of his father and older brothers and pursued a career in [[osteopathic medicine]]. He enrolled at [[Hanover College]] in [[Indiana]] to study pre-osteopathic medical courses, then took supplementary courses at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland. Sheppard finished his medical education at the  Los Angeles Osteopathic School of Physicians and Surgeons (now University of California Irvine) and was awarded the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O) degree.\n\nHe completed his internship and a residency in Neurosurgery at [[Los Angeles County General Hospital]]. A few years after marrying Marilyn Reese on February 21, 1945, in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Sheppard returned to Ohio and joined his father's growing medical practice at [[Bay View Hospital]].\n\n== Murder of Marilyn Reese Sheppard ==\nOn the night of July 3, 1954, Sheppard and Marilyn were entertaining neighbors at their lakefront home (demolished in 1993)<ref>\n{{cite news |title=The Dr. Sam Sheppard House Revisited |date=July 4, 2014 |accessdate=February 18, 2016 |publisher=The Village Newspaper\n|url=http://www.thevillagernewspaper.com/2014/07/17/the-dr-sam-sheppard-house-revisited/\n}}</ref> on Lake Erie at 28944 Lake Road<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofbayvillage.com/history/qa.cfm#8 |title=History Q & A: Where was the Sam Sheppard house? |publisher=The City of Bay Village |year=2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011228065104/http://www.cityofbayvillage.com/history/qa.cfm#8 |archivedate=2001-12-28}}</ref> in [[Bay Village, Ohio]], a suburb of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], just west of the city. The property itself abutted the shore of [[Lake Erie]], near the west end of Huntington Reservation.  While they were watching the movie ''[[Strange Holiday (1946 film)|Strange Holiday]]'', Sheppard fell asleep on the daybed in the living room. Marilyn walked the neighbors out.\n\nIn the early morning hours of July 4, 1954, Marilyn Sheppard was bludgeoned to death in her bed with an unknown instrument. The bedroom was covered with blood spatter and drops of blood were found on floors throughout the house. Some items from the house, including Sam Sheppard's wristwatch, keychain and key, and fraternity ring, appeared to have been stolen.<ref name=QofEvidence/>  They were later found in a canvas bag in shrubbery behind the house.<ref name=QofEvidence>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Colin |title=A Question of Evidence: The Casebook of Great Forensic Controversies, from Napoleon to O.

He ran upstairs where he saw a form in the bedroom and then he was knocked unconscious. When he awoke, he saw the person downstairs, chased the intruder out of the house down to the beach where they tussled and Sheppard was knocked unconscious again.\n\nAt 5:40 am, a neighbor received an urgent phone call from Sheppard who pleaded for him to come to his home. When the neighbor and his wife arrived, Sheppard was found shirtless and his pants were wet with a bloodstain on the knee. Authorities arrived shortly thereafter. Sheppard seemed disoriented and in shock.<ref>{{cite book |last=Neff |first=James |year=2001 |title=The Wrong Man |url=https://archive.org/details/wrongmanfinalver00neff |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Random House |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wrongmanfinalver00neff/page/5 5\u20139]}}</ref> The family dog was not heard barking to indicate an intruder, and their seven-year-old son, Sam Reese \"Chip\" Sheppard, was asleep in the adjacent bedroom during the whole ordeal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/26/us/after-life-of-notoriety-and-pain-son-tries-to-solve-his-mother-smurder.html|last=Butterfield|first=Fox|title=After Life of Notoriety and Pain, Son Tries to Solve His Mother's Murder|work=The New York Times|date=March 26, 1996|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== First trial ==\nSheppard's trial began October 18, 1954.\n\n=== Media ===\nThe murder investigation and the trial were notable for the extensive publicity. Some newspapers and other media in [[Ohio]] were accused of bias against Sheppard and inflammatory coverage of the case, and were criticized for immediately labeling him the only viable suspect. A federal judge later criticized the media, \"If ever there was a trial by newspaper, this is a perfect example. And the most insidious example was the ''[[Cleveland Press]]''. For some reason that newspaper took upon itself the role of accuser, judge and jury.\"<ref>Neff 2001, p. 230</ref>\n\nIt appeared that the local media influenced the investigators. On July 21, 1954, the ''Cleveland Press'' ran a front-page editorial titled \"Do It Now, Dr. Gerber\" which called for a public [[inquest]]. Hours later, Dr. Samuel Gerber, the coroner investigating the murder, announced that he would hold an inquest the next day.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 85</ref> The ''Cleveland Press'' ran another front-page editorial titled \"Why Isn't Sam Sheppard in Jail?\" on July 30 which was titled in later editions, \"Quit Stalling and Bring Him In!\".<ref>[http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/gvpt339/sheppard.html The Sam Sheppard Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040907234728/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/gvpt339/sheppard.html |date=September 7, 2004 }}, umd.edu; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/2001-11-08-wrong-man.htm|work=USA Today|title='Wrong Man' makes case for Sheppard's innocence|date=November 8, 2001|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> That night, Sheppard was arrested for a police interrogation.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 101-02</ref>\n\nThe local media ran salacious front-page stories inflammatory to Sheppard which had no supporting facts or were later disproved. During the trial, a popular radio show broadcast a report about a New York City woman who claimed to be his mistress and the mother of his illegitimate child. Since the jury was not [[jury sequestration|sequestered]], two of the jurors admitted to the judge that they heard the broadcast but the judge did not dismiss them.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 151-52</ref> From interviews with some of the jurors years later, it is likely that jurors were contaminated by the press before the trial and perhaps during it.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 166-68</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court later called the trial a \"carnival atmosphere\".<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=384&invol=333 ''Sheppard v. Maxwell''], 384 U.S. 333, 358 (1964) (U.S. Supreme Court)</ref>\n\n===Prosecution's theory===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe high-profile nature of the case proved to be a boon to lead prosecutor John J. Mahon, who was running for a seat on the [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] as the trial began. Mahon won his seat, and served until his death on January 31, 1962.\n\nProsecutors learned during their investigation and revealed at trial that Sheppard had carried on a three-year-long extramarital affair with Susan Hayes, a [[nurse]] at the hospital where Sheppard was employed. The prosecution argued that the affair was Sheppard's motive for killing his wife. Mahon made the most of the case in the absence of any direct evidence against the defendant, other than that he was inside the house when Marilyn Sheppard was killed. Mahon emphasized the inconsistencies in Sam Sheppard's story and that he could not give an accurate description of the intruder in his house.\n\nOther issues brought up at trial involved why there was no sand in his hair when Sheppard claimed to have been sprawled at the beach, and Sheppard's missing T-shirt, which the prosecutor speculated would or should contain some of Sheppard's blood (having been in an alleged struggle with the perpetrator). However, Prosecutor Mahon chose to make these assertions despite no T-shirt ever being found or presented as evidence. Also, part of the prosecution's case centered around (speculative) questions like why a burglar would first take the belongings in the canvas bag, only to later ditch them in bushes outside the Sheppard home.  It was under these circumstances that Mahon openly speculated Sheppard had staged the crime scene.\n\nLack of a murder weapon posed problems for the prosecution, but Cuyahoga County Coroner Samuel R. Gerber nearly circumvented this discrepancy by testifying that a blood imprint found on the pillow beneath Marilyn Sheppard's head was made by a \"two-blade surgical instrument with teeth at the end of each blade\" such as a scalpel. Inexplicably, Sheppard's lawyers left this vague assertion unchallenged. Sheppard's lawyer was denied access to the physical evidence by the judge and therefore could not argue any assertions as to blood droplets, murder weapon marks, blood spatter, physical marks on the body, etc.\n\n===Defense strategy===\nSheppard's attorney, William Corrigan, argued that Sheppard had severe injuries and that these injuries were inflicted by the intruder. Corrigan based his argument on the report made by neurosurgeon Dr. Charles Elkins, M.D., who examined Sheppard and found he had suffered a cervical concussion, nerve injury, many absent or weak reflexes (most notably on the left side of his body), and injury in the region of the second cervical vertebra in the back of the neck. Dr. Elkins stated that it was impossible to fake or simulate the missing reflex responses.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe defense further argued the crime scene was extremely bloody, yet the only blood evidence appearing on Sheppard was a bloodstain on his trousers. Corrigan also argued two of Marilyn's teeth had been broken and that the pieces had been pulled from her mouth, suggesting she had possibly bitten her assailant. He told the jury that Sheppard had no open wounds. (Some{{who|date=February 2013}} observers have questioned the accuracy of claims that Marilyn Sheppard lost her teeth while biting her attacker, arguing that her missing teeth are more consistent with the severe beating Marilyn Sheppard received to her face and skull.<ref name=cnn>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9910/05/sheppard.case|title=Body of Sam Sheppard's wife exhumed in Ohio|date=October 5, 1999|publisher=CNN.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040919212714/http://edition.cnn.com/US/9910/05/sheppard.case|archivedate=2004-09-19}}</ref>) However, as criminologist [[Paul L. Kirk]] later pointed out, if the beating had broken Mrs. Sheppard's teeth, pieces would have been found inside her mouth, and her lips would have been severely damaged, which was not the case.<ref>Affidavit of Paul L. Kirk, filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Branch, No. 64571</ref>\n\nSheppard took the stand in his own defense, testifying that he had been sleeping downstairs on a daybed when he awoke to his wife's screams.\n\n{{quote|I think that she cried or screamed my name once or twice, during which time I ran upstairs, thinking that she might be having a reaction similar to convulsions that she had in the early days of her pregnancy. I charged into our room and saw a form with a light garment, I believe, at that time grappling with something or someone. During this short period I could hear loud moans or groaning sounds and noises. I was struck down. It seems like I was hit from behind somehow but had grappled this individual from in front or generally in front of me. I was apparently knocked out. The next thing I knew, I was gathering my senses while coming to a sitting position next to the bed, my feet toward the hallway. ... I looked at my wife, I believe I took her pulse and felt that she was gone. I believe that I thereafter instinctively or subconsciously ran into my youngster's room next door and somehow determined that he was all right, I am not sure how I determined this. After that, I thought that I heard a noise downstairs, seemingly in the front eastern portion of the house.<ref>{{cite book|last1=DeSario|first1=Jack|last2=Mason|first2=William D.|title=Dr. Sam Sheppard on Trial: The Prosecutors and the Marilyn Sheppard Murder|year=2003|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=0-873-38770-8|page=345}}</ref>}}\n\nSheppard ran back downstairs and chased what he described as a \"bushy-haired intruder\" or \"form\" down to the [[Lake Erie]] beach below his home, before being knocked out again.

On July 30, 1961, Corrigan died and [[F. Lee Bailey]] took over as Sheppard's chief counsel. Bailey's petition for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' was granted on July 15, 1964, by a [[United States district court]] judge who called the 1954 trial a \"mockery of justice\" that shredded Sheppard's Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process. The State of [[Ohio]] was ordered to release Sheppard on bond and gave the prosecutor 60 days to bring charges against him, otherwise the case would be dismissed permanently.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 226-230</ref> The State of Ohio appealed the ruling to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals Court for the Sixth Circuit]], which on March 4, 1965 reversed the federal judge's ruling.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 238</ref> Bailey appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in ''[[Sheppard v. Maxwell]]''. On June 6, 1966, the Supreme Court, by an 8-to-1 vote, struck down the murder conviction. The decision noted, among other factors, that a \"carnival atmosphere\" had permeated the trial, and that the trial judge, [[Edward J. Blythin]],<ref name=statement>{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/sheppard_trial/media.htm |title=The Media and the Trial |publisher=Providence.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613195225/http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/sheppard_trial/media.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> who had died in 1958, was biased against Sheppard because Judge Blythin had refused to sequester the [[jury]], did not order the jury to ignore and disregard media reports of the case, and when speaking to newspaper columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] shortly before the trial started said, \"Well, he's guilty as hell.  There's no question about it.\"\n\nSheppard served ten years of his sentence. Three days after his 1964 release, he married Ariane Tebbenjohanns, a German divorcee who had corresponded with him during his imprisonment. The two had been engaged since January 1963. Tebbenjohanns endured her own bit of controversy shortly after the engagement had been announced, confirming that her half-sister was [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Ritschel]], the wife of [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda]] chief [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Tebbenjohanns emphasized that she held no Nazi views. On October 7, 1969, Sheppard and Tebbenjohanns divorced.<ref>[http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/sheppard/timeline_ctv.html Court TV Online \u2013 Sheppard]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514003333/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/sheppard/timeline_ctv.html |date=May 14, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n=== Retrial ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\nJury selection began October 24, 1966, and opening statements began eight days later.

Terry Gilbert, an [[Lawyer|attorney]] retained by the Sheppard family, told the media that \"the [[fetus]] in this case had previously been [[autopsy|autopsied]]\", a fact that had never previously been disclosed. This, Gilbert argued, raised questions about the coroner's office in the original case possibly concealing pertinent evidence.<ref name=cnn/> Due to the passage of time and the effect of [[formaldehyde]] on the fetus's tissues, paternity could not be established.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Richard Eberling===\nDuring the civil trial, plaintiff attorney Terry Gilbert contended that Richard Eberling, an occasional handyman and window washer at the Sheppard home, was the likeliest suspect in Marilyn's murder. Eberling found Marilyn attractive and he was very familiar with the layout of the Sheppard home.<ref>Linder, Douglas O., [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/sheppard/eberlinginfo.html \u201cDr. Sam Sheppard Trials\u201d], University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref>\n\nIn 1959, detectives were questioning Richard Eberling on various burglaries in the area. Eberling confessed to the burglaries and showed the detectives his loot, which included two rings that belonged to Marilyn Sheppard. Eberling stole the rings in 1958, a few years after the murder, from Sam Sheppard's brother's house, taken from a box marked \"Personal Property of Marilyn Sheppard\".<ref>Cleveland Police Department, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/plaintiff_exhibits_2000/113 \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 0022: Eberling Statement\" (1959)], Sheppard 2000 Trial Plaintiff's Exhibits. Book 113.</ref> In subsequent questioning, Eberling admitted his blood was at the crime scene of Marilyn Sheppard. He stated that he cut his finger while washing windows just prior to the murder and bled while on the premises.<ref>Tompkins, James R., \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 0020: Bay Village Police Report re: Eberling\" (1988). Sheppard 2000 Trial Plaintiff's Exhibits. Book 114. http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/plaintiff_exhibits_2000/114</ref> As part of the investigation, Eberling took a polygraph test with questions about the murder of Marilyn. The polygraph examiner concluded that Eberling did not show deception in his answers, although the polygraph results were evaluated by other experts years later who found that it was either inconclusive or Eberling was deceptive.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 212, 352</ref>\n\nIn his testimony in the 2000 civil lawsuit, Bailey stated that he rejected Eberling as a suspect in 1966 because \"I thought he passed a good polygraph test.\" When it was presented to Bailey that an independent polygraph expert said Eberling either murdered Marilyn or had knowledge of who did, Bailey stated that he probably would have presented Eberling as a suspect in the 1966 retrial.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 351-52</ref>\n\n[[DNA]] evidence, which was not available in the two murder trials, played an important role in the civil trial. DNA analysis of blood at the crime scene showed that there was presence of blood from a third person, other than Marilyn and Dr. Sam Sheppard.<ref>Chakarborty, Ranajit, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_dna/17 \"Chakraborty Report on DNA Typing Involving Richard Eberling, Sam Sheppard, and Marilyn Sheppard\" (2000)],. Blood Evidence and DNA \u2013 Sam Sheppard Case. Book 17.</ref>\n\nWith regard to tying the blood to Eberling, the DNA analysis that was allowed to be admitted to the trial was inconclusive. A plaintiff DNA expert was 90% confident that one of the blood spots belonged to Richard Eberling but, according to the rules of the court, this was not admissible. The defense argued that the blood evidence had been tainted in the years since it was collected, and that an important blood spot on the closet door in Marilyn Sheppard's room potentially included 83% of the adult white population. The defense also pointed out that the results in 1955 from the older blood typing technique, that the blood collected from the closet door was Type O, while Eberling's [[ABO blood group system|blood type]] was Type A.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 364-367</ref>\n\nThroughout his life, Richard Eberling was associated with women who had suspicious deaths and he was convicted of murdering Ethel May Durkin, a wealthy, elderly widow who died without any immediate family. Durkin's 1984 murder in [[Lakewood, Ohio]], was uncovered when a court-appointed review of the woman's estate revealed that Eberling, Durkin's guardian and executor, had failed to execute her final wishes, which included stipulations on her burial.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nDurkin's body was exhumed and additional injuries were discovered in the autopsy that did not match Eberling's previous claims of in-house accidents, including a fall down a staircase in her home.  In subsequent legal action, both Eberling and his partner, Obie Henderson, were found guilty in Durkin's death. Coincidentally, both of Durkin's sisters, Myrtle Fray and Sarah Belle Farrow, had died under suspicious circumstances as well. Fray was killed after being \"savagely\" beaten about the head and face and then strangled; Farrow died following a fall down the basement steps in the home she shared with Durkin in 1970, a fall in which she broke both legs and both arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlthough Eberling denied any criminal involvement in the murder of Marilyn Sheppard,<ref>[http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/famouspeople/a/sheppard.htm Sam Sheppard Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917234853/http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/famouspeople/a/sheppard.htm |date=September 17, 2005 }}, columbusoh.about.com; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref> Kathy Wagner Dyal, who worked alongside Eberling in caring for Ethel May Durkin, also testified that Eberling had confessed to her in 1983.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 298</ref> A fellow convict also reported that Eberling confessed to the crime. The defense called into question the credibility of both witnesses during the 2000 civil trial. Eberling died in an Ohio prison in 1998, where he was serving a [[life sentence]] for the 1984 murder of Ethel May Durkin.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Defense===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nSteve Dever led the defense trial team for the State of Ohio, which included assistant prosecutors Dean Maynard Boland and Kathleen Martin. They argued that Sheppard was the most logical suspect, and presented expert testimony suggesting that Marilyn Sheppard's murder was a textbook domestic [[homicide]]. They argued that Sheppard had not welcomed the news of his wife's pregnancy, he wanted to continue his affairs with Susan Hayes and with other women, and he was concerned about the [[social stigma]] that a divorce might create.  They claimed the evidence showed that Marilyn Sheppard may have hit Sam Sheppard, sparking an angry rage that resulted in her bludgeoning. Boland evaluated evidence that had been considered by fifty years of investigators, journalists and others, and during the trial he was the first to suggest that the murder weapon used by Sam Sheppard was a bedroom lamp.\n\nThe defense asked why Sheppard had not called out for help, why he had neatly folded his jacket on the daybed in which he said he had fallen asleep, and why the family dog, which several witnesses had testified (in the first trial in 1954) was very loud when strangers came to the house, had not barked on the night of the murder (implying that the dog knew the killer).\n\n===Verdict===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nAfter ten weeks of trial, 76 witnesses, and hundreds of exhibits, the case went to the eight-person civil jury. The jury deliberated just three hours on April 12, 2000, before returning a unanimous [[verdict]] that Samuel Reese Sheppard had failed to prove that his father had been wrongfully imprisoned.\n\n===Invalidation of wrongful imprisonment claim===\nOn February 22, 2002, the [[Ohio District Courts of Appeals|Eighth District Court of Appeals]] ruled unanimously that the civil case should not have gone to the jury, on the grounds that the [[statute of limitations]] had expired, and that a claim for wrongful imprisonment abated with Sam Sheppard's death.<ref>''[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_court_filings_2000/2 Murray v.
