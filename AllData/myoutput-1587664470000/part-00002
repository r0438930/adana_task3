He is well known as a rock [[session musician]], predominantly as a saxophonist. He also plays keyboards, flute, [[vibraphone]] and guitar.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Osterley]], [[Middlesex]], McDonald served five years in the [[British Army]] as a bandsman. His music talent ranged from [[European classical music|classical]] orchestra to dance bands to [[rock and roll|rock]]. In 1969, he was in [[King Crimson]]'s initial line up, which recorded their first album ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]''. McDonald and drummer [[Michael Giles]] departed and formed a spin-off group that released one album titled ''[[McDonald and Giles]]''. He reappeared in King Crimson in 1974 and intended to rejoin the band as a full member but did not get the opportunity to do so given Fripp's decision to split the band.\n\nHe became a founding member of the band [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] in 1976, for whom he played guitar as well as his woodwinds and keyboards.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd \n| location= London\n| page= 318\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref> He has been a session musician and appeared in the recording of the hit single \"[[Get It On (T.

In 1999, he released a solo album, ''Drivers Eyes''.\n\nIn 1997, the release of the King Crimson four CD set ''[[Epitaph (King Crimson album)|Epitaph]]'', consisting of rare live recordings of the 1969 version of King Crimson, renewed interest in the early Crimson material. Out of that interest, the [[21st Century Schizoid Band]] was formed in 2002 and several tours and live albums have followed. The band included former King Crimson members Michael Giles (drums and percussion), [[Peter Giles (musician)|Peter Giles]] (bass), McDonald (sax, flute, keyboards), [[Mel Collins]] (alto/tenor sax, flute, keyboards) and also [[Jakko Jakszyk]], who later joined King Crimson, on guitar and lead vocals. After the first tour Michael Giles was replaced with another former King Crimson drummer [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]], who has since died.\n\nMcDonald has contributed saxophone and flute to several tracks on [[Judy Dyble]]'s 2009 release, [[Talking With Strangers]]. The album sees McDonald reunited with former [[King Crimson]] bandmate [[Robert Fripp]] on the 20-minute \"Harpsong\".\n\nOn 28 July 2009, McDonald made a guest appearance with [[Asia (band)|Asia]] during their opening set for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] at the [[Tower Theater (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania)|Tower Theater]] in [[Upper Darby Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]], Pennsylvania, just outside of [[Philadelphia]].

Played flute and shared lead vocals/vocal harmonies with Greg Lake on \"I Talk to the Wind\" while playing solo flute on \"Lucky Man\". For these two songs, it was \"Emerson, Lake & McDonald\".\n\nIn 2010, Ian provided alto sax, flute and percussion textures to ''Beautiful Accident'', the debut album by progressive blues band, Third International. One track, \"Penitentiary\" was co-written by Ian with Third International frontman, Andrew Pearson.\n\nIn 2011, McDonald began working with long-time neighbour Lynnea Benson and her husband Ted Zurkowski, directors of New York City's Frog and Peach Theatre Company, which specialises in off-Broadway productions and readings of Shakespearean plays. In collaboration with Zurkowski, McDonald composed and performed guitar and piano music to accompany select Frog and Peach Shakespearean productions and readings: ''Julius Caesar'', ''Two Gentleman of Verona'', ''Hamlet'', ''A Midsummer Nights Dream'', ''King Lear'', ''The Taming of the Shrew'' and ''Measure for Measure''.
