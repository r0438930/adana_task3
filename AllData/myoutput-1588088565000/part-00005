But generally the following pattern is observed.\n\n====Ranks of IPS officers====\nIPS officers are appointed on the basis of either Civil Service Examination or promoted from the state cadre officers. Vacancy in an IPS cadre are determined on the basis of vacancy on an Superintendent of Police rank. Consequently, there are two level of gradations for SP rank. These are level 11 and 12 as per the Seventh Pay Commission. Resultantly, IPS officers remain on the rank on SP till the 13th year after which they are eligible for being promoted as Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP). ASP rank is the junior most rank on an IPS state cadre. Consequently, fresh recruits to IPS are variously posted as Assistant Superintendent of Police in a supernumerary capacity (only for training purpose for two years and after that for 1 year) till they are formally placed as Superintendent of Police In-Charge of an area (when they get the pay of level 11 and level 12) and as district in charge (when they get the pay of level 12) (only in non-metropolitan districts). When the officers get promoted to the rank of SSP, some of them are posted as the district in-charge of metropolitan districts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahapolice.gov.in/jsp/temp/html/policerank.pdf|title=Police Ranks|website=[[Maharashtra Police]]|access-date=14 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815030350/http://www.mahapolice.gov.in/jsp/temp/html/policerank.pdf|archive-date=15 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.keralapolice.org/kerala-police/about-us/governance|title=Governance of Kerala Police|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Kerala Police]]|access-date=14 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://odishapolice.gov.in/?q=node/199|title=Police Ranks and Badges|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Odisha Police]]|access-date=15 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Director Intelligence Bureau's Insignia Equivalent to Armed Forces Generals\">{{cite web|url=http://www.persmin.nic.in/EmployeesCorner/Acts_Rules/AISRule/IPSRules/IPS(Uniform)Rules(Revised).htm#_ftnref21|title=Director, Intelligence Bureau's Insignia Equivalent to Armed Forces Generals|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416223152/http://persmin.nic.in/EmployeesCorner/Acts_Rules/AISRule/IPSRules/IPS(Uniform)Rules(Revised).htm#_ftnref21|archivedate=16 April 2009}}</ref>\n{{Indian Police Service Officer Ranks}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Car flags.jpg\n| width1 = 185\n| image2 = Car stars Police.jpg\n| width2 = 195\n| footer = Flags (top photo) & Stars (bottom photo) on official cars of senior IPS officers, as per their rank.\n| align = \n| total_width = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n:\n\n==Reforms and major concerns==\nIndia's police continue to be governed by a [[British Raj|colonial]] police law passed in 1861.

But generally the following pattern is observed.\n\n====Ranks of IPS officers====\nIPS officers are appointed on the basis of either Civil Service Examination or promoted from the state cadre officers. Vacancy in an IPS cadre are determined on the basis of vacancy on an Superintendent of Police rank. Consequently, there are two level of gradations for SP rank. These are level 11 and 12 as per the Seventh Pay Commission. Resultantly, IPS officers remain on the rank on SP till the 13th year after which they are eligible for being promoted as Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP). ASP rank is the junior most rank on an IPS state cadre. Consequently, fresh recruits to IPS are variously posted as Assistant Superintendent of Police in a supernumerary capacity (only for training purpose for two years and after that for 1 year) till they are formally placed as Superintendent of Police In-Charge of an area (when they get the pay of level 11 and level 12) and as district in charge (when they get the pay of level 12) (only in non-metropolitan districts). When the officers get promoted to the rank of SSP, some of them are posted as the district in-charge of metropolitan districts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahapolice.gov.in/jsp/temp/html/policerank.pdf|title=Police Ranks|website=[[Maharashtra Police]]|access-date=14 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815030350/http://www.mahapolice.gov.in/jsp/temp/html/policerank.pdf|archive-date=15 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.keralapolice.org/kerala-police/about-us/governance|title=Governance of Kerala Police|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Kerala Police]]|access-date=14 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://odishapolice.gov.in/?q=node/199|title=Police Ranks and Badges|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Odisha Police]]|access-date=15 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Director Intelligence Bureau's Insignia Equivalent to Armed Forces Generals\">{{cite web|url=http://www.persmin.nic.in/EmployeesCorner/Acts_Rules/AISRule/IPSRules/IPS(Uniform)Rules(Revised).htm#_ftnref21|title=Director, Intelligence Bureau's Insignia Equivalent to Armed Forces Generals|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416223152/http://persmin.nic.in/EmployeesCorner/Acts_Rules/AISRule/IPSRules/IPS(Uniform)Rules(Revised).htm#_ftnref21|archivedate=16 April 2009}}</ref>\n{{Indian Police Service Officer Ranks}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Car flags.jpg\n| width1 = 185\n| image2 = Car stars Police.jpg\n| width2 = 195\n| footer = Flags (top photo) & Stars (bottom photo) on official cars of senior IPS officers, as per their rank.\n| align = \n| total_width = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n:\n\n==Reforms and major concerns==\nIndia's police continue to be governed by a [[British Raj|colonial]] police law passed in 1861.
