It's hard not to wonder if her failure to connect with a mass audience might be because her desire to work with concepts and characters, rather than unburden herself, suggests a certain aloofness... She is as elusive as ever, and her mystery remains intact.

It demonstrates that artful resistance and pop music are not mutually exclusive.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> [[Neil McCormick]] for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called ''Dirty Computer'' \"unblushingly and unsparingly direct...[It] establishes itself as a contender for album of the year, in more ways than one... [Mon\u00e1e]'s layered sound is as contemporary as that of such digital trailblazers as [[Kendrick Lamar]] or [[Kanye West]], yet it has an old-fashioned organic quality that comes from a bedrock of live musicianship. ''Dirty Computer'' sounds like 2018 distilled into a sci-fi funk pop extravaganza by a female [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].\"<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> ''[[The Independent]]'' reviewer Roisin O'Connor stated that ''Dirty Computer'' is \"a record that will go down as a milestone not just as a work of art in its own right, but as the perfect celebration of queerness, female power, and self-worth.\"<ref name=\"independent\"/> Danette Chavez of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described that, on ''Dirty Computer'', \"the erstwhile \"Electric Lady\" loses the metal and circuitry, but none of her power or artistry, cementing her status alongside Prince in the hall of hyper-talented, gender-fluid icons who love and promote blackness.\"<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nJosh Hurst for ''[[Flood Magazine]]'' wrote that \"Every generation needs its own soundtrack for kicking against the pricks, and Mon\u00e1e delivers one\u2014easily the most pop-conversant, hook-laden, and propulsive music of her career.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floodmagazine.com/50411/janelle-monae-dirty-computer/|title=Janelle Mon\u00e1e, \"Dirty Computer\"|website=[[Flood Magazine]]|last=Hurst|first=Josh|date=May 7, 2018|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]], who in the past had found Mon\u00e1e's voice too thin and her songwriting overly intellectual, was converted by ''Dirty Computer''{{'}}s Prince-inspired, [[sex-positive]] songs: \"Too often prosex albums are shallow. While remaining intellectual, this one is more personal than the android dared.\"<ref name=\"vice\"/>\n\nIn a less enthusiastic review, [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that \"You occasionally wonder if an understandable desire to cross over commercially might not be at the root of the album's less inspired moments: there's something commonplace and risk-averse about the pop-R&B backing of \"Crazy, Classic, Life\" and \"I Got the Juice\"... It's hard not to wonder if her failure to connect with a mass audience might be because her desire to work with concepts and characters, rather than unburden herself, suggests a certain aloofness... She is as elusive as ever, and her mystery remains intact. Without a true loosening of her poise, her position on the margins of pop could remain intact as well.\"<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Zachary Hoskins from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' declared that \"while the songs here are consistently hooky, they lack the earlier albums' sonic adventurousness... While Mon\u00e1e's heart is in the right place, her lyrics occasionally suffer from the clumsiness endemic to politicized pop... If ''Dirty Computer'' feels somewhat blunter and less ambitious than Mon\u00e1e's earlier work, though, it's also her most immediately satisfying.\"<ref name=\"Slant\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/janelle-monae-dirty-computer|title=Janelle Mon\u00e1e: Dirty Computer|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|first=Zachary|last=Hoskins|date=April 27, 2018|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe album was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and the music video for \"[[Pynk]]\" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|61st]] [[Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/61st-annual-grammy-awards|title=Winners & Nominees - 61st Annual GRAMMY Awards (2018)|website=Grammy.com|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref> The associated narrative film was a finalist for the 2019 [[Hugo Awards]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation \u2014 Short Form]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18291920/2019-hugo-award-nominations-science-fiction-fantasy-books |title= Here are the 2019 Hugo Award nominees |first1= Andrew | last1= Liptak|work= The Verge |date= April 2, 2019 |accessdate= April 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Year-end lists\n|-\n!
