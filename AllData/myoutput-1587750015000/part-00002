It is based on the [[teleplay]] by Hillman Taylor and Buchanan. It is a low-budget [[16mm]] film color [[remake]] of [[Roger Corman]]'s ''[[It Conquered the World]]'' (1956), which also featured an alien invader from Venus.\n\n==Plot==\nAt a dinner party with their wives, [[NASA]] scientist Dr. Keith Ritchie (Tony Huston) reveals to his colleague Dr. Curt Taylor ([[John Agar]]) that he has secretly been in communication with an alien from Venus named Zontar who he claims is coming to Earth to solve all of the world's problems.  However, as soon as Zontar arrives on Earth via a fallen [[laser]] [[satellite]] it quickly becomes obvious that the  three-eyed, bat-winged, skeletal black creature has a hidden agenda, as it begins causing local power outages that stop telephones, automobiles and even running water from working, and it starts taking control of people's minds using flying lobster-like \"injecto-pods\" that sprout from its wings. Only after his wife is killed does Ritchie finally realize that Zontar has come not as a savior but as a conqueror, and he goes to confront the hideous alien in the [[sulfur spring]]-heated cave that it has made its secret base.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a review for [[AllMovie]], Paul Gaita wrote \"For experienced [[cult film|cult movie]] watchers, ''Zontar'' is the cinematic equivalent of a car accident, an unpleasant spectacle from which one cannot look away\".<ref>{{cite web |title = Zontar, the Thing from Venus (1966) |first=Paul|last=Gaita|url = http://www.allmovie.com/movie/zontar-the-thing-from-venus-v56183/review |publisher = [[AllMovie]] |accessdate = November 7, 2016}}</ref> Chris Eggerston of [[Bloody Disgusting]] criticized the alien in the film for resembling \"a human-sized shit-monster with wings\", but felt that it looked better than the alien from ''It Conquered the World''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/19353 |title=Not So Scary\u2026 Top Ten Worst Movie Monsters!|author=Eggerston, Chris |website=Bloody Disgusting |date=March 4, 2010 |accessdate=October 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Zontar, the Thing from Venus'' is arguably Buchanan's best known film.<ref name=\"filmfax\">Goodsell, Greg, \"The Weird and Wacky World of Larry Buchanan\", ''Filmfax'', No. 38 April/May 1993 p 64</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1966]]\n*[[List of films featuring extraterrestrials]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0061217}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=Zontar_Thing_From_Venus}}\n\n{{Larry Buchanan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zontar, The Thing From Venus}}\n[[Category:1966 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Venus in film]]\n[[Category:American film remakes]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:Horror film remakes]]\n[[Category:American International Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1960s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:Horror television films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Larry Buchanan]]\n\n\n{{sf-horror-film-stub}}\n{{US-tv-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = Zontar, the Thing from Venus\n| image          = Zontar, The Thing from Venus(1956 film) poster.jpg\n| caption        = DVD cover\n| director       = [[Larry Buchanan]]\n| producer       = \n| writer         = [[Lou Rusoff]]<br>[[Larry Buchanan]]<br>Hillman Taylor\n| starring       = [[John Agar]]<br>Susan Bjurman\n| music          = Ronald Stein (uncredited)\n| cinematography = Robert B.
