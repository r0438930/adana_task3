The [[Socialist Labor Party (Canada)|Socialist Labor Party]] was formed in 1898 in Vancouver. The [[Socialist Party of British Columbia]] in 1901. The [[Socialist Party of Canada]] was the first Canadian-wide based [[Socialism|Socialist]] party by native Canadians, founded in 1904.\n\nLater, the [[Winnipeg General Strike of 1919]] and [[Great Depression]] (1929\u20131939) are considered to have fuelled socialism in Canada.\n\n== History ==\n=== Communism ===\n[[File:Fred rose2.jpg|thumb|1945 election poster for Fred Rose, the first Communist MP]]\nDuring the Great Depression, the [[Communist Party of Canada]] experienced a brief surge in popularity, becoming influential in various [[trade union|labour union]]s and electing a single [[Member of Parliament#Canada|Member of Parliament]], [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]]. The Communist Party of Canada was created in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]] in 1921 by a group of Marxist activists led by [[William Moriarty]]. During the early years of their existence the party's membership faced persecution and arrest for their political activities. In 1935 the Communists gained notoriety by organizing a massive march of unemployed workers known as the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] and before that organized the young inmates of the relief camps into the [[Relief Camp Workers' Union]] to resist the poor conditions of the camps. The On-to-Ottawa Trek never made it to [[Ottawa]]; instead it ended with the [[Regina Riot]] of July 1, 1935. The trek and the living conditions in the government's \"relief camps\" helped to discredit [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[R. B. Bennett]], leading to his defeat at the hands of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] in [[1935 Canadian federal election|1935]]. After the trek the communists were instrumental in organizing over 1,448 Canadians to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nJoined by volunteers of other political stripes, the Canadian contingent known as the [[Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion]] joined the [[International Brigades]] (a coalition of volunteers from many countries) to fight for the elected leftwing government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] against the [[fascist]]-supported insurgency of General [[Francisco Franco]]. The \"Mac-Paps\" fought bravely in many battles but were forced to leave Spain in 1938 by Prime Minister [[Juan Negr\u00edn|Juan Negr\u00edn L\u00f3pez]] along with the other foreign volunteers as it became clear that the war was lost. Of the nearly 1,500 Canadians known to have fought in Spain, 721 were verified as having lost their lives. The most famous Canadian to serve in the [[Mackenzie\u2013Papineau Battalion]] was Dr. [[Norman Bethune]], a surgeon who would invent the world's first mobile medical unit. Dr. Bethune would later be killed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], while aiding the [[Communist Party of China]]. Today he is a national hero in the [[People's Republic of China]] and is remembered as being a friend of Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]].\n\nBy the end of [[World War II]], the Communist Party began to lose its momentum. Its only elected federal representative, Fred Rose, was accused of being a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy. Rose was expelled from parliament, arrested for four years, and then followed at every job site by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP). He eventually left for [[Poland]] with the intention of returning to clear his name, but had his Canadian citizenship revoked in 1957.\n\n=== Democratic socialism ===\n[[File:CooperativeCommonwealthFederationFoundingMeeting.jpg|thumb|350px|CCF founding meeting in Regina, 1933]]\nBy a wide margin, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] political party from the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]] with its origins in the [[Christian left]] and the [[social gospel]], became the most influential socialist party in Canada.\n\nThe CCF gained support in the Prairies as well as from many [[labour unions]]. Led by [[Tommy Douglas]], the CCF was elected to power during the [[1944 Saskatchewan general election|1944 Saskatchewan election]]. Douglas governed Saskatchewan until 1961. As of the 2019, his party remains an important force in the politics of the province. The CCF also emerged as the official opposition in British Columbia during the [[1941 British Columbia general election|election of 1941]] and in Ontario during the province's [[1943 Ontario general election|1943 election]].  At the federal level, opinion polls initially indicated a dramatic surge in support for the CCF prior to the [[1945 Canadian federal election|1945 federal election]].  Although in the end it only translated into modest gains for the party, it is widely believed to have influenced the early steps taken by Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] in introducing the welfare state.{{weasel inline|date=April 2016}} The CCF and the early democratic socialist movement is seen, by some political scientists (such as [[Gad Horowitz]]), as mainly a Christian and European Canadian movement.\n\nIn 1961, the CCF joined with the [[Canadian Labour Congress]] to form the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP). The NDP is more [[Centre-left|moderate]] and [[social-democratic]] than its predecessor, the CCF. The [[Regina Manifesto]] of the CCF called for abolishing [[capitalism]] while the NDP merely wants to reform capitalism. They are generally perceived as being responsible for the creation of [[Universal health care|universal healthcare]], [[pension]]s, a human rights code and for the development of Canada's [[social safety net]] in general.{{weasel inline|date=April 2016}} In the past the NDP has formed provincial governments in [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Yukon Territory]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], and [[Nova Scotia]]. At present only British Columbia has a New Democratic government, while the NDP is the second largest party in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and the Yukon. At the federal level the NDP has held strong influence over various [[minority government]]s, in particular a Liberal minority led by [[Pierre Trudeau]] from 1972-1974 during the [[29th Canadian Parliament]]. During this period the NDP was successful in forcing the government to create a state-owned oil company, called [[Petro Canada]].\n\nThe NDP has also held influence over other Liberal-led minority governments during the [[Lester B. Pearson]] government (1963-1968) and the [[Paul Martin]] government (2004-2006). Their self stated goal is to one day form a federal government on their own and introduce social-democratic policies.\n\nIn the province of [[Quebec]], the NDP has been considerably less popular, but recently, in the May 2, 2011 [[2011 Canadian federal election|Canadian Federal Election]] a record number of NDP Members of Parliament were elected, including 59 of the 75 available seats in Quebec. The party was the Official Opposition in the [[41st Canadian Parliament]].\n\nFor most of the late 20th century, the strongest social-democratic party in Quebec has been the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]. Like the NDP, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is generally considered to be \"social democratic\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arsenault|first=Gabriel|date=2018-06-22|title=Explaining Quebec's Social Economy Turn|url=http://www.anserj.ca/anser/index.php/cjnser/article/view/237|journal=Canadian Journal of Nonprofit and Social Economy Research|volume=9|issue=1|page=62|doi=10.22230/cjnser.2018v9n1a237|issn=1920-9355|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n=== Revolutionary socialism ===\nMany socialists in Canada have attempted to organize outside of the framework of parliamentary politics, to pursue conceptions of socialism that are more radical than the social-democratic politics of either the CCF or the NDP.\n\nSome of the radical socialist organizations operating in Canada today include [[Socialist Action (Canada)]] the [[International Socialists (Canada)]], [[Socialist Alternative (Canada)]], Spring, the [[Communist League (Canada)]], Autonomy & Solidarity,<ref>[http://auto_sol.tao.ca Upping the Anti | A Journal of Theory and Action<!-- Job Board Check-in Received 08-Sep-2016 Your online check-in request has been received as of 08-Sep-2016.

However a minority faction are committed to democratic socialism, including, but not restricted to, the radical [[Socialist Caucus]]. The policies of various provincial and territorial branches of the NDP have varied in the past from the left-wing to the [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]]. The party's youth group is known as the [[New Democratic Youth of Canada]]. The provincial branches of the NDP are:\n** [[Yukon New Democratic Party]] - official opposition\n** [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] - governing party with support from the Greens. \n** [[Alberta New Democratic Party]] - official opposition\n** [[Saskatchewan New Democratic Party]] - official opposition\n** [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba]] - official opposition\n** [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] - official opposition\n** [[New Democratic Party of Newfoundland and Labrador]] - third party\n** [[Nova Scotia New Democratic Party]] - third party\n** [[New Brunswick New Democratic Party]] - not represented in the legislature\n** [[New Democratic Party of Prince Edward Island]] - not represented in the legislature\n* The [[Communist Party of Canada]] sees itself as being \"Canada's party of socialism\" and with its origins going back to 1921 the CPC is the second oldest existing political party in Canada after the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. The Communist Party has active branches in [[Communist Party (Alberta)|Alberta]], [[Communist Party of Ontario|Ontario]], [[Communist Party of Canada (in Manitoba)|Manitoba]], [[Communist Party of Canada (Saskatchewan)|Saskatchewan]], and [[Communist Party of British Columbia|British Columbia]]. In [[Quebec]] there was a split in 2006 between a separatist and federalist faction in the [[Communist Party of Quebec]]. The PCQ is now led by [[Andre Parizeau]] the leader of the separatist faction, while the party's federalists have regrouped into the PCC/PCQ and are tied to the federal party.<ref>[http://www.pcq-pcc.qc.ca./ Pcc/Pcq<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824063912/http://www.pcq-pcc.qc.ca/ |date=2007-08-24 }}</ref> The CPC also has a youth group, known as the [[Young Communist League of Canada]].\n* The [[Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)]] was created in 1971 as a so-called [[Anti-Revisionist]] party supportive of [[Maoism]] and of Albanian leader [[Enver Hoxha]]. Today the ideology of the CPC (ML) or Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada is less doctrinaire than in the past but still considered more radical than that of the Communist Party of Canada. They support radically changing the way candidates are nominated and elected and are generally supportive of [[North Korea]]. Their members are active in the [[Canadian Union of Postal Workers]] and [[United Steelworkers of America]]. The CPC (ML) has active provincial branches in British Columbia (the [[People's Front (British Columbia)|People's Front]]), [[Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist) (in Manitoba)|Manitoba]], [[Independent Renewal candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election|Ontario]] and in Quebec (the [[Parti marxiste-l\u00e9niniste du Qu\u00e9bec]]).\n* [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|Revolutionary Communist Party]] is a [[communist]] organization advocating the overthrow of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system. It is in the organizing stage. The ideology of the organization, founded in 2000, can be regarded as [[anti-revisionist]] in character. They describe their ideology as \"Marxism-Leninism-Maoism\" which they consider the third phase of [[Marxism]]. The group does not take part in electoral politics, instead aiming to educate the working class about the need for a [[revolution]] in the style of the Russian and Chinese revolutions. The PRC-RCP is non-collaborationist and opposes all Canadian political parties, including ones calling themselves communist.\n* [[Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire]] (\"Solidarity Quebec\") is Quebec's most popular left-wing party. They claim to be devoted to the causes of democratic socialism, such as [[environmentalism]], [[feminism]], [[Quebec Sovereignty]] and [[alter-globalization]]. They have gained support amongst left-wing sovereigntist voters who are disillusioned with the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois' embrace of [[neoliberalism]].\n* [[Socialist Party of Canada (WSM)]] formed in 1931 publishes a journal called Imagine and is a companion party of the [[World Socialist Movement]].\n* Fightback, the Canadian section of the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] organization called the [[International Marxist Tendency]] publishes a self-titled newspaper<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxist.ca|title=Fightback Canada - Home|website=www.marxist.ca|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-13}}</ref> and practices [[Entryism]] in [[Qu\u00e9bec solidaire|Quebec Solidaire]] and the [[New Democratic Party|NDP]]\n\n=== Historical parties ===\nParties that have held seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and provincial legislatures.\n* [[Canadian Labour Party]] (1917-1942)\n* [[Ginger Group]] (1924-1932) - a group of radical members of the [[Progressive Party of Canada]]\n* [[United Farmers (disambiguation)|United Farmers]] - farmer advocacy groups tied to the [[Progressive Party of Canada]]. In Ontario, the [[United Farmers of Ontario]] governed from 1919 to 1924 with a fairly social democratic agenda, while the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] governed Alberta from 1921 to 1930 following more conservative guidelines.\n* [[Socialist Party of Canada]] - names used by two political parties. The first existed from 1905 to 1925 and was created by the [[Socialist Party of British Columbia]]; it played an important role in the creation of the CCF. The second has existed since 1931 and has been very marginal in terms of support.\n* [[Labor-Progressive Party]] - was the name used by the [[Communist Party of Canada]] from 1941 to 1959 while it was an illegal party. The LPP followed a Marxist line and succeeded in not only electing a member of the House of Commons, but also electing representatives to the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]].\n* [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (1932-1962) - known as the CCF, it was, before the NDP, Canada's most popular left-wing party. The CCF was formed during [[The Great Depression]] by members of the centrist [[Progressive Party of Canada]] (the Ginger Group), the United Farmers, the Labour Party and a social advocacy group known as the [[League for Social Reconstruction]]. At the party's first convention in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], the ''[[Regina Manifesto]]'' was launched announcing that: \"No CCF Government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the Co-operative Commonwealth.\" The radical ''Regina Manifesto'' was replaced by the more moderate ''[[Winnipeg Declaration]]'' in 1956. The CCF went on to form one of Canada's most popular and historically significant provincial governments in 1944 in the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]] under Tommy Douglas. In [[Ontario]] the CCF formed the official opposition in 1943 and again in 1948 until losing that position to the Liberals. In [[British Columbia]] the CCF also formed the official opposition after 1941. Federally the party never got past third place and in an attempt to broaden their support base the CCF merged with the [[Canadian Labour Congress]] to create the NDP.\n* [[Cape Breton Labour Party]], the Cape Breton Labour Party was a social-democratic party from the province of [[Nova Scotia]] represented in the Nova Scotia legislature from 1981-1988 by a former NDP member [[Paul MacEwan]].\n* [[New Democratic Party of Quebec]] was the [[Quebec]] wing of the NDP. The Quebec NDP failed to win any significant support or win any seats in the Quebec legislature (its parent party, the Quebec CCF won one). After years of infighting in 1989, the party broke off relations with the federal NDP and in 1994 changed its name to the [[Parti de la Democratie Socialiste]] (PDS) or \"Socialist Democratic Party\". The PDS adopted a program calling for Quebec's separation from Canada and had attempted to nominate a former terrorist, [[Paul Rose (political figure)|Paul Rose]] (formerly of the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec|FLQ]]) as a federal candidate. The PDS contested the [[1998 Quebec general election|1998 Quebec election]] without any success. In 2002 the PDS joined the [[Communist Party of Quebec]] and other [[far-left politics|far left]], sovereigntist parties in an alliance known as the [[Union des forces progressistes (Canada)|Union des forces progressistes]] (UFP). In 2006 the UFP became [[Quebec solidaire]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Anarchism in Canada]]\n* [[Conservatism in Canada]]\n* [[Douglas-Coldwell Foundation]]\n* [[Fascism in Canada]]\n* [[History of Canada]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[League for Social Reconstruction]]\n* [[Liberalism in Canada]]\n* [[Monarchism in Canada]]\n* [[Politics of Canada]]\n* [[Republicanism in Canada]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- DO NOT WRITE IN \"ref\" TAGS HERE.

The policies of various provincial and territorial branches of the NDP have varied in the past from the left-wing to the [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]]. The party's youth group is known as the [[New Democratic Youth of Canada]]. The provincial branches of the NDP are:\n**[[Yukon New Democratic Party]] - official opposition\n**[[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] - governing party with support from the Greens. \n**[[Alberta New Democratic Party]] - official opposition\n**[[Saskatchewan New Democratic Party]] - official opposition\n**[[New Democratic Party of Manitoba]] - official opposition\n**[[Ontario New Democratic Party]] - official opposition\n**[[New Democratic Party of Newfoundland and Labrador]] - third party\n**[[Nova Scotia New Democratic Party]] - third party\n**[[New Brunswick New Democratic Party]] - not represented in the legislature\n**[[New Democratic Party of Prince Edward Island]] - not represented in the legislature\n*The [[Communist Party of Canada]] sees itself as being \"Canada's party of socialism\" and with its origins going back to 1921 the CPC is the second oldest existing political party in Canada after the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. The Communist Party has active branches in [[Communist Party (Alberta)|Alberta]], [[Communist Party of Ontario|Ontario]], [[Communist Party of Canada (in Manitoba)|Manitoba]], [[Communist Party of Canada (Saskatchewan)|Saskatchewan]], and [[Communist Party of British Columbia|British Columbia]]. In [[Quebec]] there was a split in 2006 between a separatist and federalist faction in the [[Communist Party of Quebec]]. The PCQ is now led by [[Andre Parizeau]] the leader of the separatist faction, while the party's federalists have regrouped into the PCC/PCQ and are tied to the federal party.<ref>[http://www.pcq-pcc.qc.ca./ Pcc/Pcq<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824063912/http://www.pcq-pcc.qc.ca/ |date=2007-08-24 }}</ref> The CPC also has a youth group, known as the [[Young Communist League of Canada]].\n*The [[Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist)]] was created in 1971 as a so-called [[Anti-Revisionist]] party supportive of [[Maoism]] and of Albanian leader [[Enver Hoxha]]. Today the ideology of the CPC (ML) or Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada is less doctrinaire than in the past but still considered more radical than that of the Communist Party of Canada. They support radically changing the way candidates are nominated and elected and are generally supportive of [[North Korea]]. Their members are active in the [[Canadian Union of Postal Workers]] and [[United Steelworkers of America]]. The CPC (ML) has active provincial branches in British Columbia (the [[People's Front (British Columbia)|People's Front]]), [[Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist) (in Manitoba)|Manitoba]], [[Independent Renewal candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election|Ontario]] and in Quebec (the [[Parti marxiste-l\u00e9niniste du Qu\u00e9bec]]).\n*[[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|Revolutionary Communist Party]] is a [[communist]] organization advocating the overthrow of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system. It is in the organizing stage. The ideology of the organization, founded in 2000, can be regarded as [[anti-revisionist]] in character. They describe their ideology as \"Marxism-Leninism-Maoism\" which they consider the third phase of [[Marxism]]. The group does not take part in electoral politics, instead aiming to educate the working class about the need for a [[revolution]] in the style of the Russian and Chinese revolutions. The PRC-RCP is non-collaborationist and opposes all Canadian political parties, including ones calling themselves communist.\n*[[Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire]] (\"Solidarity Quebec\") is Quebec's most popular left-wing party. They claim to be devoted to the causes of democratic socialism, such as [[environmentalism]], [[feminism]], [[Quebec Sovereignty]] and [[alter-globalization]]. They have gained support amongst left-wing sovereigntist voters who are disillusioned with the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois' embrace of [[neoliberalism]].\n*[[Socialist Party of Canada (WSM)]] formed in 1931 publishes a journal called Imagine and is a companion party of the [[World Socialist Movement]].\n*Fightback, the Canadian section of the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] organization called the [[International Marxist Tendency]] publishes a self-titled newspaper<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxist.ca|title=Fightback Canada - Home|website=www.marxist.ca|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-13}}</ref> and practices [[Entryism]] in [[Qu\u00e9bec solidaire|Quebec Solidaire]] and the [[New Democratic Party|NDP]]\n\n===Historical parties===\nParties that have held seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and provincial legislatures.\n*[[Canadian Labour Party]] (1917-1942)\n*[[Ginger Group]] (1924-1932) - a group of radical members of the [[Progressive Party of Canada]]\n*[[United Farmers (disambiguation)|United Farmers]] - farmer advocacy groups tied to the [[Progressive Party of Canada]]. In Ontario, the [[United Farmers of Ontario]] governed from 1919 to 1924 with a fairly social democratic agenda, while the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] governed Alberta from 1921 to 1930 following more conservative guidelines.\n*[[Socialist Party of Canada]] - names used by two political parties. The first existed from 1905 to 1925 and was created by the [[Socialist Party of British Columbia]]; it played an important role in the creation of the CCF. The second has existed since 1931 and has been very marginal in terms of support.\n*[[Labor-Progressive Party]] - was the name used by the [[Communist Party of Canada]] from 1941 to 1959 while it was an illegal party. The LPP followed a Marxist line and succeeded in not only electing a member of the House of Commons, but also electing representatives to the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]].\n*[[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (1932-1962) - known as the CCF, it was, before the NDP, Canada's most popular left-wing party. The CCF was formed during [[The Great Depression]] by members of the centrist [[Progressive Party of Canada]] (the Ginger Group), the United Farmers, the Labour Party and a social advocacy group known as the [[League for Social Reconstruction]]. At the party's first convention in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], the ''[[Regina Manifesto]]'' was launched announcing that: \"No CCF Government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the Co-operative Commonwealth.\" The radical ''Regina Manifesto'' was replaced by the more moderate ''[[Winnipeg Declaration]]'' in 1956. The CCF went on to form one of Canada's most popular and historically significant provincial governments in 1944 in the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]] under Tommy Douglas. In [[Ontario]] the CCF formed the official opposition in 1943 and again in 1948 until losing that position to the Liberals. In [[British Columbia]] the CCF also formed the official opposition after 1941. Federally the party never got past third place and in an attempt to broaden their support base the CCF merged with the [[Canadian Labour Congress]] to create the NDP.\n*[[Cape Breton Labour Party]], the Cape Breton Labour Party was a social-democratic party from the province of [[Nova Scotia]] represented in the Nova Scotia legislature from 1981-1988 by a former NDP member [[Paul MacEwan]].\n*[[New Democratic Party of Quebec]] was the [[Quebec]] wing of the NDP. The Quebec NDP failed to win any significant support or win any seats in the Quebec legislature (its parent party, the Quebec CCF won one). After years of infighting in 1989, the party broke off relations with the federal NDP and in 1994 changed its name to the [[Parti de la Democratie Socialiste]] (PDS) or \"Socialist Democratic Party\". The PDS adopted a program calling for Quebec's separation from Canada and had attempted to nominate a former terrorist, [[Paul Rose (political figure)|Paul Rose]] (formerly of the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec|FLQ]]) as a federal candidate. The PDS contested the [[1998 Quebec general election|1998 Quebec election]] without any success. In 2002 the PDS joined the [[Communist Party of Quebec]] and other [[far-left politics|far left]], sovereigntist parties in an alliance known as the [[Union des forces progressistes (Canada)|Union des forces progressistes]] (UFP). In 2006 the UFP became [[Quebec solidaire]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Politics of Canada]]\n*[[History of Canada]]\n*[[History of Socialism]]\n*[[League for Social Reconstruction]]\n*[[Douglas-Coldwell Foundation]]\n*[[Liberalism in Canada]]\n*[[Conservatism in Canada]]\n*[[Republicanism in Canada]]\n*[[Monarchism in Canada]]\n*[[Fascism in Canada]]\n*[[Anarchism in Canada]]\n\n==References==\n<!--DO NOT WRITE IN \"ref\" TAGS HERE.
