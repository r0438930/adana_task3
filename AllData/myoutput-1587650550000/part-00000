Professional roller derby quickly became popular; in 1940, more than 5 million spectators watched in about 50 American cities. In the ensuing decades, however, it predominantly became a form of [[sports entertainment]], where theatrical elements overshadowed athleticism. Gratuitous showmanship largely ended with the sport's grassroots revival in the first decade of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D01D520xcws |title=Roller Derby: The Fastest Growing Sport In America |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-02-26 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref> Although roller derby retains some sports entertainment qualities such as player pseudonyms and colorful uniforms, it has abandoned scripted bouts with predetermined winners.<ref>Neale, Rick (24 June 2008).

Jams last two minutes unless called off prematurely.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} Each team designates a scoring player (the \"jammer\"); the other four members are \"blockers\". One blocker can be designated as a \"pivot\"\u2014a blocker who is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}} The next jam may involve different players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}}\n\nDuring each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored only by a team's jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin another \"trip\" through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any opposing blocker.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|33}}<ref group=note name=\"2019change\">Until 2019, the jammer also scored a point by passing the opposing jammer. There were 5 potential points per trip.</ref> The rules describe an \"earned\" pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds and upright. The jammer's first earned pass scores a point for passing that blocker and a point for each opponent blocker not on the track (for instance, serving a penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). If the jammer passes the entire pack, it is a four-point scoring trip, commonly called a \"grand slam\".<ref group=note name=\"2019change\" />\n\nEach team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help their jammer score while hindering the opposing team's jammer.\n\n===Jams===\n[[File:TwoNorthWestJammers.jpg|thumb|left|Two jammers (from the [[Oly Rollers]] and [[Rainy City Roller Dolls|Rainy City]]) race from the jammer line]]\nPlay begins by blockers lining up on the track anywhere between the \"jammer line\" and the \"pivot line\" 30 feet in front.

Once earned, lead jammer status cannot be transferred to other skaters, but certain actions (notably, being sent to the penalty box) can cause it to be lost.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|8}} The lead jammer can stop the jam at any time by repeatedly placing both hands on their hips.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|}} If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds to get on the track and line up for the next jam.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} If the period expires, it does not halt a jam that is underway.\n\n===Blocking===\n[[File:BlockerOnPivot.ogv|thumb|An Idahoan blocker impedes a Utahn pivot at Spudtown Knockdown IV in 2013 in [[Garden City, Idaho]].]]\nA skater may block an opponent to impede their movement or to force them out of bounds.

Blocking with hands, elbows, head, and feet is prohibited, as is contact above the shoulders or below mid-thigh, and blocking from behind.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|14}}\n\n===Penalties===\n[[File:Roller derby, Amsterdam Derby Dames against the Ruhr Pott Roller Girls from Essen, Germany.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A German pivot attempts to knock a Dutch jammer out of bounds (the yellow line) at a 2011 bout held in [[Essen, Germany]].]]\nReferees penalize rules violations.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|36}} A player receiving a penalty is removed from play to sit in a [[penalty box]] for 30 seconds of jam time.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|29}} If the jam ends during this interval, the player remains in the penalty box during the subsequent jam until the interval ends.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|30}} The penalized player's team plays short-handed, as in [[ice hockey]].\n\nHowever, the \"power jam\", derived from hockey's [[Power play (sporting term)#Ice hockey|\"power play\"]], does not cover any short-handed situation but only the case where the jammer is penalized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://svrollergirls.wordpress.com/roller-derby-a-glossary/|title=Roller derby: A glossary|publisher=Silicon Valley Roller Girls|accessdate=2018-06-26}}</ref> In this case, that team cannot score.  While the lead jammer is penalized, no one can prematurely end the jam.\n\nIt would be pointless to play if neither team could score; thus, a jammer is released from the penalty box early if the opponents' jammer enters the box. The second jammer's penalty is then only as long as the amount of time the first jammer spent in the box.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|31}} A player \"fouls out\" of the game on the seventh penalty, and is required to return to the locker room.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|32}}\n\n===Equipment===\nPlayers skate on four-wheeled (\"quad\") roller skates,<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} and are required to wear protective equipment, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and mouth guards. All current sets of roller derby rules explicitly forbid [[inline skates]] for players. (USARS requires quad skates for all skaters. WFTDA and MRDA permit inline skates for referees, but virtually all referees wear quad skates.) Individual teams may mandate additional gear, such as padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a hard-case sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|39}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nOffense and defense are played simultaneously,<ref>{{Cite news |title=A Local Roller Derby Team Shows Its Toughness at a Saturday Bout but Doesn't Get a Win |author=Brauns, Katie |newspaper=Bend Bulletin |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090412%2FSPORTS05%2F904120421%2F1041&nav}}</ref> a volatile aspect that complicates strategy and tactics.

The strategy for a jam is not to score a lot of points but to outscore the opposition. Often, the lead jammer scores as many points as possible on the first scoring trip, and then ends the jam before the opposing jammer can begin a scoring trip.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Play: Strategy|url=http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|publisher=Atlanta Roller Girls|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928095235/http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|archive-date=28 September 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> If the jammer gets the lead but falls behind the opposing jammer, the coach may conclude that the team will be outscored and direct the jammer to call off the jam.\n*'''Passing the star''': The jammer for a team may \"pass the star\" (may perform a \"star pass\") to the pivot\u2014that is, hand the helmet cover with the star to the pivot, which turns the pivot into the jammer.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|9}} Passing the star does not nullify any earned pass of an opponent that the former jammer made, but passing the star forward never constitutes an earned pass. A jammer might pass the star because of fatigue, injury, or because the pivot is in a better position to score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com/2011/07/by-position-pivotno-1.html|title=Five Point Grand Slam: By the Position \u2013 Pivot/No. 1|first=Tripp|last=Crouse|date=15 July 2011|website=Fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref> Passing the star is also sometimes referred to as \"passing the panty\", as helmet covers are sometimes known as \"panties\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://derbystein.wordpress.com/2015/08/09/passing-the-panty/|title=Passing the Panty|date=9 August 2015|website=Derbystein.wordpress.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n*'''Penalty-killing''': Captained by the pivot, blockers adapt their play to a penalty situation. For example, a short-handed team may try to make the pack skate faster to slow down scoring action until the team returns to full strength.<ref name=\"LearnPivot\" /><ref group=note>Before 2013, there were \"major\" and \"minor\" penalties, the former included any player's fourth penalty, and it was strategic for a key player to deliberately commit such a penalty when it would have least effect.</ref>\n\n[[Tactic (method)|Tactics]] (deliberate conceptual tasks in support of the strategy) may include the following:\n*'''Walling up''': Two or more blockers skate together to make it difficult for the opposing team (especially its jammer) to maneuver. They may skate side-by-side and use a \"wide stance\" to maximize the blockade, but must not link with or grasp each other, or otherwise form an impenetrable connection.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" /> The ability to suddenly form a wall denies the opposition time to respond. A wall can inhibit, slow down, and ultimately trap the opposing jammer. An effective wall may last for an entire jam. Variations on the tactic include the following:\n**Backwards bracing, in which one skater, forward of the wall, skates backward to sight the jammer and direct teammates forming the wall.\n**A skater may break off from the wall to actively challenge the opposing jammer, with a teammate replacing the skater in the wall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bump|first=Speed|title=Strategy 101: The Wall|url=https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|publisher=Rose City Rollers|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171821/https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|archive-date=14 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n**If the opposing jammer tries to pass the wall on one side, players may abandon the other side to fortify the active side of the wall.\n[[File:Roller Derby (22).jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Richter City Roller Derby|Wellington]] skaters (in purple) form a wall, limiting their opponents' movement, while their jammer (leftmost skater in purple) takes a hip whip to accelerate past the pack]]\n*'''Jammer tactics''', in response to a wall or other obstacles by the defense, include the following:\n**Pushing through gaps in the wall or inducing the wall to separate by use of physical force.\n**Evading the obstacle to one side or the other.\n**[[Juke (football move)|Juking]], where the jammer seems to be skating to one side but quickly shifts to the other side.\n**Rolling around the end of the obstacle (spinning 360\u00b0) to end up forward of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pivotstar.com/evasive-jamming-pt1/|title=Roller Derby Training: Evasive Jamming \u2013 Part One|author=Lucy Croysdill|publisher=pivotstar.com|accessdate=2018-09-29}}</ref>\n**Using teammates to impede the defense from adjusting, such as by setting [[Screen (sports)|screens]].\n**Using a '''whip''', where one or more teammates grasp the jammer's hand(s) and swing the jammer forward, transferring speed and momentum to the jammer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Joulwan|first=Melissa|title=Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track - p 95|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGizDBbRfjYC&pg=PA95 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416538554|date=2007-04-06}}</ref>\n**Using the inside curve of the track to leap out of bounds but land in bounds.\n*'''Goating''': The pack is defined as ''the largest group of in-bounds blockers, skating in proximity, containing members from both teams.''<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} In the \"goat-herding\" tactic, one team surrounds a blocker of the opposing team and then slows so that that group becomes the pack. The rest of the opposing team, skating ahead, are thus put out of play and cannot legally block the goat-herders' jammer.\n*'''Running back''' or '''recycling''': When a skater bumps the opponent jammer off the track, the jammer can only re-enter the track behind the skater. The skater skates clockwise on the track toward the rear of the engagement zone to maximize the time the jammer must spend before returning to action.<ref name=western-style>{{cite news| url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/western-style-roller-derby-windy-city-rollers/Content?oid=2592374| title = Game Changer| work = [[Chicago Reader]]| date = 21 October 2010| first = Ling |last = Ma| accessdate = 31 October 2010}}</ref>\n*'''Bridging''': By separating up to 10 feet, blockers can stretch both the pack and the engagement zone, allowing teammates to keep hindering the opposition jammer. For example, in the strategy of running back (see above), coordinated action by the four skaters other than the jammer could force the opponent jammer to detour a full 40 feet before returning to action.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Falcon|first1=M|title=Derby Techniques of Interest Part 1: Knocking a jammer out of bounds and forming a bridge|url=http://www.tbayrollergirls.com/derby-techniques-of-interest/|publisher=Thunder Bay Roller Derby League|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Officials==\nWFTDA bouts are officiated by three to seven skating referees and many non-skating officials (NSOs).<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|35}} Volunteer leagues adapt when fewer than the optimal number of officials are present.\n\n===Referees===\nUp to four referees skate on the inside of the track.

Jams last two minutes unless called off prematurely.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} Each team designates a scoring player (the \"jammer\"); the other four members are \"blockers\". One blocker can be designated as a \"pivot\"\u2014a blocker who is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}} The next jam may involve different players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}}\n\nDuring each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored only by a team's jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin another \"trip\" through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any opposing blocker.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|33}}<ref group=note name=\"2019change\">Until 2019, the jammer also scored a point by passing the opposing jammer. There were 5 potential points per trip.</ref> The rules describe an \"earned\" pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds and upright. The jammer's first earned pass scores a point for passing that blocker and a point for each opponent blocker not on the track (for instance, serving a penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). If the jammer passes the entire pack, it is a four-point scoring trip, commonly called a \"grand slam\".<ref group=note name=\"2019change\" />\n\nEach team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help their jammer score while hindering the opposing team's jammer.\n\n===Jams===\n[[File:TwoNorthWestJammers.jpg|thumb|left|Two jammers (from the [[Oly Rollers]] and [[Rainy City Roller Dolls|Rainy City]]) race from the jammer line]]\nPlay begins by blockers lining up on the track anywhere between the \"jammer line\" and the \"pivot line\" 30 feet in front. The jammers start behind the jammer line.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|12}} Jams begin on a single short whistle blast, upon which both jammers and blockers may begin engaging immediately.\n\n[[File:Texas Roller Derby Lonestar Rollergirls.jpg|thumb|Lonestar Rollergirls in Austin, Texas, play on a banked track. The jammer (wearing the starred helmet cover) is trying to pass a pivot (wearing a striped cover) with various blockers assisting.]]\nThe pack is the largest single group of blockers containing members of both teams skating in proximity, arranged such that each player is within 10 feet of the next.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} Blockers must maintain the pack, but can skate freely within 20 feet behind and ahead of  it, an area known as the \"engagement zone\".<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|13}}\n\nThe first jammer to break through the pack earns the status of \"lead jammer\".<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}} A designated referee blows the whistle twice, and skates near, and points at, the lead jammer. Once earned, lead jammer status cannot be transferred to other skaters, but certain actions (notably, being sent to the penalty box) can cause it to be lost.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|8}} The lead jammer can stop the jam at any time by repeatedly placing both hands on their hips.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|}} If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds to get on the track and line up for the next jam.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} If the period expires, it does not halt a jam that is underway.\n\n===Blocking===\n[[File:BlockerOnPivot.ogv|thumb|An Idahoan blocker impedes a Utahn pivot at Spudtown Knockdown IV in 2013 in [[Garden City, Idaho]].]]\nA skater may block an opponent to impede their movement or to force them out of bounds. The blocker must be upright, skating counterclockwise, in bounds, and within the engagement zone. Blocking with hands, elbows, head, and feet is prohibited, as is contact above the shoulders or below mid-thigh, and blocking from behind.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|14}}\n\n===Penalties===\n[[File:Roller derby, Amsterdam Derby Dames against the Ruhr Pott Roller Girls from Essen, Germany.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A German pivot attempts to knock a Dutch jammer out of bounds (the yellow line) at a 2011 bout held in [[Essen, Germany]].]]\nReferees penalize rules violations.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|36}} A player receiving a penalty is removed from play to sit in a [[penalty box]] for 30 seconds of jam time.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|29}} If the jam ends during this interval, the player remains in the penalty box during the subsequent jam until the interval ends.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|30}} The penalized player's team plays short-handed, as in [[ice hockey]].\n\nHowever, the \"power jam\", derived from hockey's [[Power play (sporting term)#Ice hockey|\"power play\"]], does not cover any short-handed situation but only the case where the jammer is penalized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://svrollergirls.wordpress.com/roller-derby-a-glossary/|title=Roller derby: A glossary|publisher=Silicon Valley Roller Girls|accessdate=2018-06-26}}</ref> In this case, that team cannot score.  While the lead jammer is penalized, no one can prematurely end the jam.\n\nIt would be pointless to play if neither team could score; thus, a jammer is released from the penalty box early if the opponents' jammer enters the box. The second jammer's penalty is then only as long as the amount of time the first jammer spent in the box.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|31}} A player \"fouls out\" of the game on the seventh penalty, and is required to return to the locker room.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|32}}\n\n===Equipment===\nPlayers skate on four-wheeled (\"quad\") roller skates,<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} and are required to wear protective equipment, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and mouth guards. All current sets of roller derby rules explicitly forbid [[inline skates]] for players. (USARS requires quad skates for all skaters. WFTDA and MRDA permit inline skates for referees, but virtually all referees wear quad skates.) Individual teams may mandate additional gear, such as padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a hard-case sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|39}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nOffense and defense are played simultaneously,<ref>{{Cite news |title=A Local Roller Derby Team Shows Its Toughness at a Saturday Bout but Doesn't Get a Win |author=Brauns, Katie |newspaper=Bend Bulletin |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090412%2FSPORTS05%2F904120421%2F1041&nav}}</ref> a volatile aspect that complicates strategy and tactics.

The strategy for a jam is not to score a lot of points but to outscore the opposition. Often, the lead jammer scores as many points as possible on the first scoring trip, and then ends the jam before the opposing jammer can begin a scoring trip.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Play: Strategy|url=http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|publisher=Atlanta Roller Girls|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928095235/http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|archive-date=28 September 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> If the jammer gets the lead but falls behind the opposing jammer, the coach may conclude that the team will be outscored and direct the jammer to call off the jam.\n*'''Passing the star''': The jammer for a team may \"pass the star\" (may perform a \"star pass\") to the pivot\u2014that is, hand the helmet cover with the star to the pivot, which turns the pivot into the jammer.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|9}} Passing the star does not nullify any earned pass of an opponent that the former jammer made, but passing the star forward never constitutes an earned pass. A jammer might pass the star because of fatigue, injury, or because the pivot is in a better position to score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com/2011/07/by-position-pivotno-1.html|title=Five Point Grand Slam: By the Position \u2013 Pivot/No. 1|first=Tripp|last=Crouse|date=15 July 2011|website=Fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref> Passing the star is also sometimes referred to as \"passing the panty\", as helmet covers are sometimes known as \"panties\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://derbystein.wordpress.com/2015/08/09/passing-the-panty/|title=Passing the Panty|date=9 August 2015|website=Derbystein.wordpress.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n*'''Penalty-killing''': Captained by the pivot, blockers adapt their play to a penalty situation. For example, a short-handed team may try to make the pack skate faster to slow down scoring action until the team returns to full strength.<ref name=\"LearnPivot\" /><ref group=note>Before 2013, there were \"major\" and \"minor\" penalties, the former included any player's fourth penalty, and it was strategic for a key player to deliberately commit such a penalty when it would have least effect.</ref>\n\n[[Tactic (method)|Tactics]] (deliberate conceptual tasks in support of the strategy) may include the following:\n*'''Walling up''': Two or more blockers skate together to make it difficult for the opposing team (especially its jammer) to maneuver. They may skate side-by-side and use a \"wide stance\" to maximize the blockade, but must not link with or grasp each other, or otherwise form an impenetrable connection.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" /> The ability to suddenly form a wall denies the opposition time to respond. A wall can inhibit, slow down, and ultimately trap the opposing jammer. An effective wall may last for an entire jam. Variations on the tactic include the following:\n**Backwards bracing, in which one skater, forward of the wall, skates backward to sight the jammer and direct teammates forming the wall.\n**A skater may break off from the wall to actively challenge the opposing jammer, with a teammate replacing the skater in the wall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bump|first=Speed|title=Strategy 101: The Wall|url=https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|publisher=Rose City Rollers|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171821/https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|archive-date=14 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n**If the opposing jammer tries to pass the wall on one side, players may abandon the other side to fortify the active side of the wall.\n[[File:Roller Derby (22).jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Richter City Roller Derby|Wellington]] skaters (in purple) form a wall, limiting their opponents' movement, while their jammer (leftmost skater in purple) takes a hip whip to accelerate past the pack]]\n*'''Jammer tactics''', in response to a wall or other obstacles by the defense, include the following:\n**Pushing through gaps in the wall or inducing the wall to separate by use of physical force.\n**Evading the obstacle to one side or the other.\n**[[Juke (football move)|Juking]], where the jammer seems to be skating to one side but quickly shifts to the other side.\n**Rolling around the end of the obstacle (spinning 360\u00b0) to end up forward of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pivotstar.com/evasive-jamming-pt1/|title=Roller Derby Training: Evasive Jamming \u2013 Part One|author=Lucy Croysdill|publisher=pivotstar.com|accessdate=2018-09-29}}</ref>\n**Using teammates to impede the defense from adjusting, such as by setting [[Screen (sports)|screens]].\n**Using a '''whip''', where one or more teammates grasp the jammer's hand(s) and swing the jammer forward, transferring speed and momentum to the jammer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Joulwan|first=Melissa|title=Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track - p 95|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGizDBbRfjYC&pg=PA95 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416538554|date=2007-04-06}}</ref>\n**Using the inside curve of the track to leap out of bounds but land in bounds.\n*'''Goating''': The pack is defined as ''the largest group of in-bounds blockers, skating in proximity, containing members from both teams.''<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} In the \"goat-herding\" tactic, one team surrounds a blocker of the opposing team and then slows so that that group becomes the pack. The rest of the opposing team, skating ahead, are thus put out of play and cannot legally block the goat-herders' jammer.\n*'''Running back''' or '''recycling''': When a skater bumps the opponent jammer off the track, the jammer can only re-enter the track behind the skater. The skater skates clockwise on the track toward the rear of the engagement zone to maximize the time the jammer must spend before returning to action.<ref name=western-style>{{cite news| url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/western-style-roller-derby-windy-city-rollers/Content?oid=2592374| title = Game Changer| work = [[Chicago Reader]]| date = 21 October 2010| first = Ling |last = Ma| accessdate = 31 October 2010}}</ref>\n*'''Bridging''': By separating up to 10 feet, blockers can stretch both the pack and the engagement zone, allowing teammates to keep hindering the opposition jammer. For example, in the strategy of running back (see above), coordinated action by the four skaters other than the jammer could force the opponent jammer to detour a full 40 feet before returning to action.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Falcon|first1=M|title=Derby Techniques of Interest Part 1: Knocking a jammer out of bounds and forming a bridge|url=http://www.tbayrollergirls.com/derby-techniques-of-interest/|publisher=Thunder Bay Roller Derby League|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Officials==\nWFTDA bouts are officiated by three to seven skating referees and many non-skating officials (NSOs).<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|35}} Volunteer leagues adapt when fewer than the optimal number of officials are present.\n\n===Referees===\nUp to four referees skate on the inside of the track.

The other teams included the Maniacs (led by Guru Drew), Bad Attitude (led by Ms. Georgia Hase), the Rockers (led by DJ Terringo and consisting of skaters who were also professional rock and roll musicians), and Hot Flash (led by Juan Valdez Lopez).
