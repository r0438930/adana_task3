The population was 469 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to Houck's History of Missouri, the town of Cooter was named in 1854 for the Madame Coutre, the owner of a brothel that served travelers that passed through the Missouri Bootheel. Madame Coutre is believed to have emigrated from [[France]] in the mid-1700s to the Franco-American village of [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve, Missouri]]. Marie Coutre travelled inland westward, and in 1795 is listed in documents as being a merchant and tavern owner in the area of present-day Cooter. \n\nShe was famous for her extra large vaginal labia that were sought out by riverboat crewmen looking for company. It was due to her renown vagina that cooter entered American English as a slang word. Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, was said to have paid for \"some cooter\" at least four times during his career as a riverboat pilot. Madame Marie Coutre ran the brothel until her death in 1812. Her daughter, Joan Cooter, took over the family business, which lasted five generations.\n\nThe Cooter Tavern Inn was shutdown in 1929 by a crack team of FBI agents enforcing Prohibition laws. The brothel was demolished, but the town retains the name of its legendary founder.<ref>A History of Missouri Vol. 2, by Louis Houck. Published by R.R.
