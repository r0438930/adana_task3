By March 26, 1914, Carranza's forces were {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr = on}} from the prosperous coastal oil town of [[Tampico, Tamaulipas]]. There was a considerable settlement of U.S. citizens in the area due to the immense investment by U.S. firms in the local oil industry.

As a result of anti-American sentiment, Mexico maintained neutrality during World War I, refusing to support the U.S. in Europe, all the while continuing to do business with Germany. With the U.S. threatening to invade in 1918 to take control of the Tampico oil fields, Mexican President [[Venustiano Carranza]] threatened to have them destroyed to prevent their falling under U.S. control.\n\n== Background ==\nBy the spring of 1914, diplomatic relations between the US and Mexico were strained. [[US President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] refused to recognize the presidency of Mexican General [[Victoriano Huerta]], who had been installed as president the previous year after Huerta and the conservative rebel [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|General F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]], a nephew of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], had signed the Embassy Pact with the approval of US Ambassador [[Henry Lane Wilson]], who had since been removed by the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/O-W/Wilsonian-Missionary-Diplomacy-Intervention-in-mexico.html|title=''Wilsonian Missionary Diplomacy- Intervention in Mexico''|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|36-37}}\n\nDuring his [[State of the Union]] address on 2 Dec. 1913, Wilson stated, \"There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority.\"  In Jan, 1914, Wilson recognized the Constitutionalists, and lifted the arms embargo on 3 Feb.

Ships at his disposal included the battleships ([[USS Connecticut (BB-18)|''Connecticut'']] and [[USS Minnesota (BB-22)|''Minnesota'']]) and the cruisers ([[USS Chester (CL-1)|''Chester'']] and [[USS Des Moines (CL-17)|''Des Moines'']]).  American interests included the Standard Oil refinery at Arbol Grande, other petroleum properties at Do\u00f1a Cecilia, and associated American families and homes nearby.  Although [[Tampico]] was besieged by Constitutionalist forces, relations between the US forces and Huerta's federal garrison remained amicable. Mayo's [[flagship]], the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Dolphin|PG-24|2}}, honored a request of the Mexican government and fired a [[21-gun salute]] to the Mexican flag three times on 2 April.<ref name=\"Logbook of USS Dolphin\">Logbook of USS Dolphin</ref> This was in commemoration of the capture of [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] from the [[French intervention in Mexico|French]] in 1867 by General [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]].  Additionally, sailors from the American gun boat and 2 cruisers, anchored off Tampico in the [[P\u00e1nuco River]], went ashore each day to play baseball.<ref name=Quirk/>\n\nOn 6 April, Constitutionalist rebel forces, under the command of Col. Emiliano J. Nafarrete, occupied La Barra, Do\u00f1a Cecilia, and Arbol Grande. General Ignacio Morelos Zaragoza, Tamaulipas governor and commander of the federal garrison, sent  his gunboat ''Veracruz'' to shell the rebel forces behind the oil tanks.  Mayo sent a letter to both parties stating he would remain neutral, but to protect American lives and property, he would \"take all necessary steps.\"  Mayo then evacuated several Americans, but refused to land troops to protect the American refinery.  After additional rebel attacks on 7 and 8 April at the Iturbide Bridge, the foreign population sought refuge on the American ships, and the cruisers [[SMS Dresden (1907)|''Dresden'']] and [[HMS Hermione (1893)|''Hermione'']].  Clarence Miller, American [[consul (representative)|consul]] in Tampico, sent an urgent request for help in evacuating the American population within the city.  Then, on the evening of 8 April, a marine [[courier]] for the American consulate was detained but soon released.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|14-18}} \n\nRunning short on gasoline, ''Dolphin's'' Capt. [[Ralph Earle (American naval officer)|Ralph Earle]], visited the American consulate on 9 April, where he arranged a purchase from a German civilian, Max Tyron.  Capt.

However, the dock was located in close proximity to the Iturbide Bridge.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|20}}\n\n[[File:Tampico_Incident.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|US battleships steaming toward Veracruz following the Tampico Affair. <br>\n'''Inset:''' Appearing in the photograph (left to right): Rear Admiral Henry T.

Though flying the American colors fore and aft, the American sailors were unarmed and unable to speak Spanish.  While loading the gasoline, the Americans were surrounded by an armed squad of Zaragoza's soldiers.  Two sailors, [[Coxswain]] G.H. Siefert and [[Seaman (rank)|Seaman]] J.P. Harrington, were still on board the American whaleboat, but they too were taken at gunpoint.  All were taken to Col. Ram\u00f3n H. Hinojosa's headquarters.

Earle and Admiral Mayo aboard the ''Dolphin'', and Mayo ordered Earle to seek his men's release under strong protest.  Earle, accompanied by Clarence Miller, met with Zaragoza who apologized, explaining his men were \"evidently ignorant of the first laws of war.\"  Within an hour of their arrest, the whaleboat had returned to the ''Dolphin''.  Ensign Copp was faulted by Mayo for allowing his men to be taken from an American vessel.  Furthermore, Mayo viewed the incident as an insult to American sovereignty, requiring reparation.  Mayo had Commander [[William A. Moffett]] deliver a note to Zaragoza stating, \"taking men from a boat flying the American flag is a hostile act, not to be excused.\"  Mayo further demanded a \"formal disavowal\", that the responsible officer \"receive severe punishment,\" and \"that you hoist the American flag in a prominent position on shore and salute it with 21 guns, which salute will be duly returned by this ship.\"<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|23-25}} \n\nMorelos Zaragoza referred the matter to the Mexican Ministry of War in Mexico City.

O'Shaughnessy]], the American [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in Mexico City, was informed of the incident by Roberto A. Esteva Ruiz, [[Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Relations]], on 10 April.  Ruiz requested that Mayo's demands be withdrawn, since Zaragoza had already made a verbal apology.  Both O'Shaughnessy and Ruiz brought the matter to Huerta's attention, who also agreed that Mayo's ultimatum should be withdrawn.  O'Shaughnessy then released the Mexican account to the [[Associated Press]] in Mexico, misstating that the arrested Americans involved were marines, not sailors, and that they had been \"paraded\" through the streets of Tampico.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|38-40}}\n\nOn 12 April, Huerta stated, via Ruiz to O'Shaughnessy, that since Zaragoza had apologized and arrested Hinojosa, the US had \"ample satisfaction.\"  The Mexican government would not apologize further, nor salute the American flag. Huerta called these \"humiliating terms...carrying courtesy to that point would be equivalent to accepting the sovereignty of a foreign state to the derogation of national dignity and decorum, which the president is disposed to have respected in any case.\"  O'Shaughnessy told Ruiz that Wilson might need to \"uphold our national dignity, even with armed force, if necessary.\"<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|44-45}}\n\nOn 13 April, Wilson told reporters, \"The salute will be fired.\"  On 14 April, Wilson ordered the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral [[Charles Johnston Badger]], to Mexican waters.  Huerta stated, \"Is it a calamity? No. It is the best thing that could happen to us.\"  On 15 April, Wilson stated regarding the Mexico situation, there had been \"many cases...of the flouting of the rights of American citizens or the dignity of the government of the United States, and no attempt at either reparation or correction.\"  On 16 April, Washington was notified that Huerta had agreed to a simultaneous salute, signifying \"satisfaction with which the two countries see the happy end of a conflict which has at no time been really serious.\"  Yet Wilson decided the American fleet would stay to prevent any ...\"manifestations of ill-will and contempt for the United States which Huerta has exhibited in the past,\" and misunderstood Huerta's meaning of simultaneous.  When simultaneous was finally understood, Wilson opposed the idea, and fleet orders remained the same.  Huerta maintained he had done \"everything he was obliged to do.\"  On 18 April, Wilson stated he would see Congress, \"with a view of taking such actions as may be necessary to enforce the respect due to the nation's flag,\" if Mexico did not fire the salute by the next day.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|48-51,53,60-62,65}}\n\n[[File:U.S. Navy Destroyers at Mazatlan, Mexico, April 26, 1914.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|USS ''Truxtun'' and ''Whipple'' at Mazatlan, April 26, 1914, keeping watch on Mexican gunboat ''Morales'' (two-funnel ship in background)]]\n\n==Aftermath==\nWilson sought Congressional approval for the use of armed forces on 20 April.

[[US President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] refused to recognize the presidency of Mexican General [[Victoriano Huerta]], who had been installed as president the previous year after Huerta and the conservative rebel [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|General F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]], a nephew of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], had signed the Embassy Pact with the approval of US Ambassador [[Henry Lane Wilson]], who had since been removed by the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/O-W/Wilsonian-Missionary-Diplomacy-Intervention-in-mexico.html|title=''Wilsonian Missionary Diplomacy- Intervention in Mexico''|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|36-37}}\n\nDuring his [[State of the Union]] address on 2 Dec. 1913, Wilson stated, \"There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority.\"  In Jan, 1914, Wilson recognized the Constitutionalists, and lifted the arms embargo on 3 Feb.  With these moves, Wilson was moving closer to intervention.<ref name=John>{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=John |title=Woodrow Wilson: A Biography |date=2011 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=9780307277909 |page=242\u2013243}}</ref>\n\nMayo's [[Atlantic Fleet (United States)|Fifth Division of the Atlantic Fleet]], was in Tampico to protect American lives and interest.  Ships at his disposal included the battleships ([[USS Connecticut (BB-18)|''Connecticut'']] and [[USS Minnesota (BB-22)|''Minnesota'']]) and the cruisers ([[USS Chester (CL-1)|''Chester'']] and [[USS Des Moines (CL-17)|''Des Moines'']]).  American interests included the Standard Oil refinery at Arbol Grande, other petroleum properties at Do\u00f1a Cecilia, and associated American families and homes nearby.  Although [[Tampico]] was besieged by Constitutionalist forces, relations between the US forces and Huerta's federal garrison remained amicable. Mayo's [[flagship]], the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Dolphin|PG-24|2}}, honored a request of the Mexican government and fired a [[21-gun salute]] to the Mexican flag three times on 2 April.<ref name=\"Logbook of USS Dolphin\">Logbook of USS Dolphin</ref> This was in commemoration of the capture of [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] from the [[French intervention in Mexico|French]] in 1867 by General [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]].  Additionally, sailors from the American gun boat and 2 cruisers, anchored off Tampico in the [[P\u00e1nuco River]], went ashore each day to play baseball.<ref name=Quirk/>\n\nOn 6 April, Constitutionalist rebel forces, under the command of Col. Emiliano J. Nafarrete, occupied La Barra, Do\u00f1a Cecilia, and Arbol Grande. General Ignacio Morelos Zaragoza, Tamaulipas governor and commander of the federal garrison, sent  his gunboat ''Veracruz'' to shell the rebel forces behind the oil tanks.  Mayo sent a letter to both parties stating he would remain neutral, but to protect American lives and property, he would \"take all necessary steps.\"  Mayo then evacuated several Americans, but refused to land troops to protect the American refinery.  After additional rebel attacks on 7 and 8 April at the Iturbide Bridge, the foreign population sought refuge on the American ships, and the cruisers [[SMS Dresden (1907)|''Dresden'']] and [[HMS Hermione (1893)|''Hermione'']].  Clarence Miller, American [[consul (representative)|consul]] in Tampico, sent an urgent request for help in evacuating the American population within the city.  Then, on the evening of 8 April, a marine [[courier]] for the American consulate was detained but soon released.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|14-18}} \n\nRunning short on gasoline, ''Dolphin's'' Capt. [[Ralph Earle (American naval officer)|Ralph Earle]], visited the American consulate on 9 April, where he arranged a purchase from a German civilian, Max Tyron.  Capt. Earle was to arrange delivery from Tyron's dock.  However, the dock was located in close proximity to the Iturbide Bridge.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|20}}\n\n[[File:Tampico_Incident.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|US battleships steaming toward Veracruz following the Tampico Affair. <br>\n'''Inset:''' Appearing in the photograph (left to right): Rear Admiral Henry T.

Earle ordered [[Ensign]] Charles C. Copp to take a [[whaleboat]], and crew, to pick up the gasoline from Tyron's dock.  Though flying the American colors fore and aft, the American sailors were unarmed and unable to speak Spanish.  While loading the gasoline, the Americans were surrounded by a armed squad of Zaragoza's soldiers.  Two sailors, [[Coxswain]] G.H. Siefert and [[Seaman (rank)|Seaman]] J.P. Harrington, were still on board the American whaleboat, but they too were taken at gunpoint.  All were taken to Col. Ram\u00f3n H. Hinojosa's headquarters.  He released the Americans to continue reloading their gasoline, but they were not allowed to leave until permission was received from Zaragoza.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|21-23}}<ref name=\"Logbook of USS Dolphin\"/><ref>{{cite book|last = Lenz|first = Lawrence|title = Power and Policy: America's First Steps to Superpower 1889-1922|date = 2008|publisher = Algora Publishing|location = New York|isbn = 978-0875866635|page = 186}}</ref> \n\nMax Tyron informed Capt. Earle and Admiral Mayo aboard the ''Dolphin'', and Mayo ordered Earle to seek his men's release under strong protest.  Earle, accompanied by Clarence Miller, met with Zaragoza who apologized, explaining his men were \"evidently ignorant of the first laws of war.\"  Within an hour of their arrest, the whaleboat had returned to the ''Dolphin''.  Ensign Copp was faulted by Mayo for allowing his men to be taken from an American vessel.  Furthermore, Mayo viewed the incident as an insult to American sovereignty, requiring reparation.  Mayo had Commander [[William A. Moffett]] deliver a note to Zaragoza stating, \"taking men from a boat flying the American flag is a hostile act, not to be excused.\"  Mayo further demanded a \"formal disavowal\", that the responsible officer \"receive severe punishment,\" and \"that you hoist the American flag in a prominent position on shore and salute it with 21 guns, which salute will be duly returned by this ship.\"<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|23-25}} \n\nMorelos Zaragoza referred the matter to the Mexican Ministry of War in Mexico City.  When Wilson heard of the matter from [[William Jennings Bryan]], Wilson responded, \"Mayo could not have done otherwise,\" and further, \"...unless the guilty persons are promptly punished consequences of gravest sort might ensue...\"<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|32}}\n\n[[Edith O'Shaughnessy|Nelson J. O'Shaughnessy]], the American [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in Mexico City, was informed of the incident by Roberto A. Esteva Ruiz, [[Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Relations]], on 10 April.  Ruiz requested that Mayo's demands be withdrawn, since Zaragoza had already made a verbal apology.  Both O'Shaughnessy and Ruiz brought the matter to Huerta's attention, who also agreed that Mayo's ultimatum should be withdrawn.  O'Shaughnessy then released the Mexican account to the [[Associated Press]] in Mexico, misstating that the arrested Americans involved were marines, not sailors, and that they had been \"paraded\" through the streets of Tampico.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|38-40}}\n\nOn 12 April, Huerta stated, via Ruiz to O'Shaughnessy, that since Zaragoza had apologized and arrested Hinojosa, the US had \"ample satisfaction.\"  The Mexican government would not apologize further, nor salute the American flag. Huerta called these \"humiliating terms...carrying courtesy to that point would be equivalent to accepting the sovereignty of a foreign state to the derogation of national dignity and decorum, which the president is disposed to have respected in any case.\"  O'Shaughnessy told Ruiz that Wilson might need to \"uphold our national dignity, even with armed force, if necessary.\"<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|44-45}}\n\nOn 13 April, Wilson told reporters, \"The salute will be fired.\"  On 14 April, Wilson ordered the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral [[Charles Johnston Badger]], to Mexican waters.  Huerta stated, \"Is it a calamity? No. It is the best thing that could happen to us.\"  On 15 April, Wilson stated regarding the Mexico situation, there had been \"many cases...of the flouting of the rights of American citizens or the dignity of the government of the United States, and no attempt at either reparation or correction.\"  On 16 April, Washington was notified that Huerta had agreed to a simultaneous salute, signifying \"satisfaction with which the two countries see the happy end of a conflict which has at no time been really serious.\"  Yet Wilson decided the American fleet would stay to prevent any ...\"manifestations of ill-will and contempt for the United States which Huerta has exhibited in the past,\" and misunderstood Huerta's meaning of simultaneous.  When simultaneous was finally understood, Wilson opposed the idea, and fleet orders remained the same.  Huerta maintained he had done \"everything he was obliged to do.\"  On 18 April, Wilson stated he would see Congress, \"with a view of taking such actions as may be necessary to enforce the respect due to the nation's flag,\" if Mexico did not fire the salute by the next day.<ref name=Quirk/>{{rp|48-51,53,60-62,65}}\n\n[[File:U.S. Navy Destroyers at Mazatlan, Mexico, April 26, 1914.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|USS ''Truxtun'' and ''Whipple'' at Mazatlan, April 26, 1914, keeping watch on Mexican gunboat ''Morales'' (two-funnel ship in background)]]\n\n==Aftermath==\nWilson sought Congressional approval for the use of armed forces on 20 April.  In particular, Wilson advocated \"taking Vera Cruz,\" to get rid of Huerta and his illegitimate authority.
