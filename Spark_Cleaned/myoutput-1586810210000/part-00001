The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>\n\nThe boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>\n\n==Career==\nLike the rest of her class, ''G7''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]]. On 15 April 1917, ''G7'' was patrolling between [[Lerwick]] and [[Bergen]] when she sighted the German submarine {{ship|SM|U-30|Germany|2}}. ''G7'' fired a torpedo at ''U-30'' and after an exchange of gunfire the German submarine dived away. Although ''U-30'' escaped unscathed, ''G7'' had interrupted ''U30''{{'}}s attempts to sink two Norwegian merchant ships. One, {{Ship|SS|Svanfos|1905|2}}, which still had a boarding party from ''U-30'' aboard, returned to Bergen under her own steam, while the second, the ''Borgila'', had been abandoned by her crew. ''G7'' put a salvage party aboard ''Borgila'' until the Norwegian destroyer {{Ship|HNoMS|Draug|1908|2}} arrived to take over.<ref>''Monograph No. 34'', &nbsp;p. 460.</ref>\n\nIn October 1918 ''G7'' was on patrol in the North Sea.
