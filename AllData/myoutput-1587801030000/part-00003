Maximian built several gigantic monuments, the large [[Circus (building)|circus]] (470 \u00d7 85 metres), the ''[[thermae]]'' or \"Baths of Hercules\", a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which fewer visible traces remain. Maximian increased the city area surrounded by a new, larger stone wall (about 4.5&nbsp;km long) encompassing an area of 375 acres with many 24-sided towers. The monumental area had twin towers; one included in the convent of [[San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore | San Maurizio Maggiore]] remains 16.6 m high.\n\nFrom Mediolanum the [[Emperor Constantine]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 AD, granting tolerance to all religions within the Empire, and thus paving the way for [[Christianity]] to become the dominant religion of Roman Europe. Constantine had come to Mediolanum to celebrate the wedding of his sister to the Eastern Emperor, [[Licinius]].

A fire destroyed the storehouses containing the entire food supply, and within just a few days Milan was forced to surrender.\n\nA period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its position. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city.<ref name=\"lucas:268\">Henry S.

The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orl\u00e9ans]], took part in the expedition and realized Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Fran\u00e7ois I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Fran\u00e7ois I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:Suvorov in Milan.jpg|thumb|Ceremonial reception of Russian Field Marshal [[Alexander Suvorov]] in Milan, April 1799]]\nIn 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629\u20131631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629\u201331, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece \"[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]\". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>\n\nIn 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713\u20131714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan. [[Napoleon]] invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Later, he declared Milan capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was crowned in the Duomo. Once Napoleon's occupation ended, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned Lombardy, and Milan, to Austrian control in 1815.\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\n[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" uprising against Austrian rule.]]\n\nOn March 18th, 1848 Milan efficaciously rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" ({{lang-it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering kingdom of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] sent troops in order to protect the insurgents and organsied a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont-Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy.  About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] in order to defeat Austria and establish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name=\"Solferino\">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J.

A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. Very rapid industrialization in the last two decades of the 1800s led to the birth of a massive worker class as well as bitter social conflicts. In May 1898 Milan was shaken by the [[Bava Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to soaring cost of living. \n\n[[File:Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (bombardata) 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] destroyed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings, 1943.]]\n[[File:MI-Milano-1961-piazza-Duca-d-Aosta.jpg|thumb|[[Pirelli Tower]], here in a 1961 picture, became the symbol of the modernity and audacity of the [[Italian economic miracle]].]]\n\nMilan's economic dominance in Italy secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene. It was in Milan that [[Benito Mussolini]] built his political and journalistic careers, and his fascist [[Blackshirts]] rallied for the first time in the city's [[Piazza San Sepolcro]]; here the future [[Fascist]] dictator launched his [[March on Rome]] on 28 October 1922.

The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], realised by [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the [[Burlington Arcade]] in London.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caff\u00e8'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that\u2014against the will of many of its inhabitants\u2014was being extended to the city.\n\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\n\nAfter the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.\n\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or one of its [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy : an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3039110414|page=260}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nMilan is an important national and international media centre. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], as well as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.\nOther local dailies are the general broadsheets ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', ''[[Il Giornale]]'', the Roman Catholic Church-owned ''[[Avvenire]]'', and ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', a daily business newspaper owned by [[Confindustria]] (the Italian employers' federation). Free daily newspapers include ''[[Leggo]]'' and ''[[Metro Newspapers|Metro]]''.\nMilan is also home to many architecture, art, and fashion periodicals, including ''[[Abitare]]'', ''[[Casabella]]'', ''[[Domus]]'', ''[[Flash Art]]'', ''[[Gioia (magazine)|Gioia]]'', ''[[Grazia]]'', and ''[[Vogue Italia]]''. ''[[Panorama]]'' and ''[[Oggi]]'', two of Italy's most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan.\n\nSeveral commercial broadcast television networks have their national headquarters in the Milan conurbation, including [[Mediaset]] Group (owner of [[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], [[Iris (TV channel)|Iris]] and [[Rete 4]]), [[Telelombardia]] and [[MTV Italy]]. National radio stations based in Milan include [[Radio Deejay]], [[Radio 105 Network]], [[R101 (Italy)]], [[Radio Popolare]], [[RTL 102.5]], [[Radio Capital]] and [[Virgin Radio Italia]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{main article|Lombard cuisine}}\n[[File:Panettone - Nicolettone 2017 - IMG 7085 (31752542285).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Panettone]]'' is Milan's traditional Christmas cake.]]\n[[File:GorgonzolaDSC4233.jpg|thumb|''[[Gorgonzola]]'' is a veined Milanese blue cheese.]]\nLike most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently [[rice]] than [[pasta]], [[butter]] than [[vegetable oil]] and features almost no [[tomato]] or [[Fish as food|fish]]. Milanese traditional dishes includes ''[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]],'' a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese [[Wiener Schnitzel]]). Other typical dishes are ''[[cassoeula]]'' (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with [[Cabbage|Savoy cabbage]]), ''[[ossobuco]]'' (braised [[veal]] shank served with a condiment called ''[[gremolata]]''), [[risotto|risotto alla milanese]] (with [[saffron]] and beef marrow), ''busecca'' (stewed [[tripe]] with beans), and ''brasato'' (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).\n\nSeason-related pastries include ''chiacchiere'' (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and ''tortelli'' (fried spherical cookies) for [[Carnival]], ''colomba'' (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for [[Easter]], ''pane dei morti'' (\"bread of the (Day of the ) Dead\", cookies flavoured with [[cinnamon]]) for [[All Souls' Day]] and [[panettone]] for Christmas. The ''salame Milano'', a [[salami]] with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy. Renowned Milanese cheeses are [[gorgonzola]] (from the [[Gorgonzola, Milan|namesake]] village nearby), [[mascarpone]], used in pastry-making, [[taleggio cheese|taleggio]] and quartirolo.\n\nMilan is well known for its world-class restaurants and caf\u00e9s, characterised by innovative cuisine and design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where Are the World's Best Shopping and Dining Destinations? |url=http://magazine.fourseasons.com/travel-food-style/things-to-do/personalities-perspectives/best-shopping-and-dining-around-the-world|publisher=Four Seasons Magazine|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> {{As of|2014}}, Milan has 157 Michelin-selected places, including three 2-Michelin-starred restaurants;<ref>{{cite web|title=best restaurant in milan |url=http://milan.citylisting.org/category/restaurant/ |accessdate=27 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402202228/http://milan.citylisting.org/category/restaurant/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}</ref> these include [[Cracco Peck|Cracco]], Sadler and il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michelin Guide restaurants \u2013 Milan|url=http://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurants/Restaurants-Milan-_-Milano-Italy?strLocid=31NDMwdDIxMGNORFV1TkRZek5qZz1jT1M0eE9EZ3hOdz09|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref> Many historical restaurants and bars are found in the historic centre, the [[Brera (district of Milan)|Brera]] and [[Navigli]] districts.

One theory holds that the [[Ancient Rome|Latin]] name ''[[Mediolanum]]'' comes from the Latin words ''medio'' (in the middle) and ''planus'' (plain).<ref>{{cite book|last= Ambrogio|first= Renzo|title= Nomi d'Italia : origine e significato dei nomi geografici e di tutti i comuni|year= 2009|publisher= Istituto geografico De Agostini|location= Novara|isbn= 978-8851114121|page= 385}}</ref> However, some scholars believe that ''lanum'' comes from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] root ''lan'', meaning an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''[[Llan (placename)|llan]]'', meaning \"a sanctuary or church\", ultimately cognate to English/[[German language|German]] ''[[Land]]'') in which Celtic communities used to build shrines.<ref>{{cite book|last= Wise|first= Hilary|title= The vocabulary of modern French origins, structure and function|year= 1997|publisher= Routledge|location= London|isbn= 0-203-42979-6|page= 39}}</ref> Hence ''Mediolanum'' could signify the central town or sanctuary of a Celtic tribe. Indeed, about sixty Gallo-Roman sites in [[France]] bore the name \"Mediolanum\", for example: [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] (''Mediolanum Santonum'') and [[\u00c9vreux]] (''Mediolanum Aulercorum'').<ref>{{cite book|last= Michell|first= John|title= The sacred center: the ancient art of locating sanctuaries|year= 2009|publisher= Inner Traditions|location= Rochester, Vt.|isbn= 978-1-59477-284-9|page= 32}}</ref> In addition, another theory links the name to the [[wild boar|boar sow]] (the ''[[Scrofa semilanuta]]'') an ancient emblem of the city, fancifully accounted for in [[Andrea Alciato]]'s ''Emblemata'' (1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the city walls, where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and the etymology of ''Mediolanum'' given as \"half-wool\",<ref>''medius'' + ''lanum''; Alciato's \"etymology\" is intentionally far-fetched.</ref> explained in Latin and in [[French language|French]].

Maximian built several gigantic monuments, the large [[Circus (building)|circus]] (470 \u00d7 85 metres), the ''[[thermae]]'' or \"Baths of Hercules\", a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which fewer visible traces remain. Maximian increased the city area surrounded by a new, larger stone wall (about 4.5&nbsp;km long) encompassing an area of 375 acres with many 24-sided towers.

In 539, the [[Ostrogoths]] conquered and destroyed Milan during the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In the summer of 569 the [[Lombards]] (from which the name of the Italian region [[Lombardy]] derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small [[Byzantine army|Byzantine garrison]] left for its defence.

This brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. A fire destroyed the storehouses containing the entire food supply, and within just a few days Milan was forced to surrender.\n\nA period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its position. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city.<ref name=\"lucas:268\">Henry S.

The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orl\u00e9ans]], took part in the expedition and realized Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Fran\u00e7ois I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Fran\u00e7ois I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:Suvorov in Milan.jpg|thumb|Ceremonial reception of Russian Field Marshal [[Alexander Suvorov]] in Milan, April 1799]]\nIn 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629\u20131631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629\u201331, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece \"[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]\". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>\n\nIn 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713\u20131714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan. [[Napoleon]] invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Later, he declared Milan capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was crowned in the Duomo. Once Napoleon's occupation ended, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned Lombardy, and Milan, to Austrian control in 1815.\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\n[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" uprising against Austrian rule.]]\n\nOn March 18th, 1848 Milan efficaciously rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" ({{lang-it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering kingdom of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] sent troops in order to protect the insurgents and organsied a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont-Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy.  About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] in order to defeat Austria and establish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name=\"Solferino\">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J.

A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. Very rapid industrialization in the last two decades of the 1800s led to the birth of a massive worker class as well as bitter social conflicts. In May 1898 Milan was shaken by the [[Bava Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to soaring cost of living. \n\n[[File:Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (bombardata) 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] destroyed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings, 1943.]]\n[[File:MI-Milano-1961-piazza-Duca-d-Aosta.jpg|thumb|[[Pirelli Tower]], here in a 1961 picture, became the symbol of the modernity and audacity of the [[Italian economic miracle]].]]\n\nMilan's economic dominance in Italy secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene. It was in Milan that [[Benito Mussolini]] built his political and journalistic careers, and his fascist [[Blackshirts]] rallied for the first time in the city's [[Piazza San Sepolcro]]; here the future [[Fascist]] dictator launched his [[March on Rome]] on 28 October 1922.

Lombardy is by far the most populated region of Italy, with more than ten million inhabitants, almost one sixth of the national total. It is governed by a Regional Council, composed of 80 members elected for a five-year term.  On 26 March 2018, a list of candidates of the [[Centre-right coalition]], a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Attilio Fontana, largely won the regional election, defeating a coalition of socialists, liberals and ecologists and a third party candidate from the populist [[Five Stars Movement]]. The conservatives have governed the region almost uninterruptedly since 1970. The regional council has 48 members from the Centre-right coalition, 18 from the [[Centre-left coalition]] and 13 from the Five Star Movement.

In the second half of the 19th century, Milan quickly became the main industrial centre of the new Italian nation, drawing inspiration from the great European capitals that were hubs of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], realised by [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the [[Burlington Arcade]] in London. Another late-19th-century eclectic monument in the city is the [[Cimitero Monumentale]] graveyard, built in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] style between 1863 and 1866.\n\nThe tumultuous period of early 20th century brought several, radical innovations in Milanese architecture.

In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city's architectural history, including [[Gi\u00f2 Ponti|Gio Ponti]]'s [[Pirelli Tower]] (1956\u201360), [[Torre Velasca|Velasca Tower]] (1956\u201358), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably [[Porta Nuova (Milan)|Porta Nuova]] in downtown Milan and [[FieraMilano]] in the suburb of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caff\u00e8'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that\u2014against the will of many of its inhabitants\u2014was being extended to the city.\n\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\n\nAfter the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.\n\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or one of its [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy : an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3039110414|page=260}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nMilan is an important national and international media centre. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], as well as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.\nOther local dailies are the general broadsheets ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', ''[[Il Giornale]]'', the Roman Catholic Church-owned ''[[Avvenire]]'', and ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', a daily business newspaper owned by [[Confindustria]] (the Italian employers' federation). Free daily newspapers include ''[[Leggo]]'' and ''[[Metro Newspapers|Metro]]''.\nMilan is also home to many architecture, art, and fashion periodicals, including ''[[Abitare]]'', ''[[Casabella]]'', ''[[Domus]]'', ''[[Flash Art]]'', ''[[Gioia (magazine)|Gioia]]'', ''[[Grazia]]'', and ''[[Vogue Italia]]''. ''[[Panorama]]'' and ''[[Oggi]]'', two of Italy's most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan.\n\nSeveral commercial broadcast television networks have their national headquarters in the Milan conurbation, including [[Mediaset]] Group (owner of [[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], [[Iris (TV channel)|Iris]] and [[Rete 4]]), [[Telelombardia]] and [[MTV Italy]]. National radio stations based in Milan include [[Radio Deejay]], [[Radio 105 Network]], [[R101 (Italy)]], [[Radio Popolare]], [[RTL 102.5]], [[Radio Capital]] and [[Virgin Radio Italia]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{main article|Lombard cuisine}}\n[[File:Panettone - Nicolettone 2017 - IMG 7085 (31752542285).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Panettone]]'' is Milan's traditional Christmas cake.]]\n[[File:GorgonzolaDSC4233.jpg|thumb|''[[Gorgonzola]]'' is a veined Milanese blue cheese.]]\nLike most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently [[rice]] than [[pasta]], [[butter]] than [[vegetable oil]] and features almost no [[tomato]] or [[Fish as food|fish]]. Milanese traditional dishes includes ''[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]],'' a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese [[Wiener Schnitzel]]).
