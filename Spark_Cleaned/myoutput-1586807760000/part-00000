The reduction in controls on [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] has initiated a freer atmosphere for [[sexual expression]]. More and more people now regard [[sexual rights]] as basic [[human rights]], so that everyone has the right and freedom to pursue his or her own sexual bliss.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\">David Barboza. [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/04/news/shanghai.php A people's sexual revolution in China]. ''Internal Herald Tribune'' March 4, 2007</ref>\n\nChange in the field of [[Human sexual behavior|sexuality]] reveals not only a change of sexual attitudes and behaviors but also a series of related social changes via the process of [[social transformation]]. From the [[sociological]] perspective, there have been several main factors that have created the current turning point in the contemporary Chinese social context.\n\n==Contemporary history==\nSince the early 1980s sex and sexuality have become prominent themes of public debate in China, after three decades during which discourses on sexuality were subject to stringent ideological controls.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=978-0-7456-5613-7|edition=1|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\n===Market reform and opening-up policy===\nThe denial of the ideals of the [[Cultural Revolution]], during which sex was used as a political tool to control people, is an influential factor in making changes in Chinese society.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/> During the Cultural Revolution, individual sexual preferences were supposed to give way to lofty revolutionary ideals. Extramarital affairs were portrayed as a degenerate lifestyle, and consensual pre-marital sex was immoral. [[Homosexuality]] was illegal and would be punished under the statutes for [[hooliganism]]. A person had to be sexually well-behaved in order to get a promotion or advance in his or her [[career]].<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#6 Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>\n\nReforms in the area of sexuality show a lessening amount of government control over individuals' private life. Many sex-related issues and personal lifestyles are no longer relegated to the field of [[politics]] and thus exempt from severe legal punishment or moral condemnation. Sex has been returned to the personal sphere under the domain of self-management. These changes can be seen in the weakened interference and control of the government in sex-related areas, strengthened sexual resources in the open market, a diversity of sexual lifestyles, and a strong appeal for sexual rights as human rights.\n\nFor instance, the government's control of personal lives has gradually retreated since the passing of the new marriage registration principles in October 2003, which again simplified the processes of [[marriage]] and [[divorce]]. The committed parties no longer need certification or confirmation from their place of work or the local Resident Committee to get married or divorced. The pre-marital physical, which among other things once contained an indication of the woman's [[virginity]], is no longer obligatory. The new principles reflect a greater respect for human rights, a protection of marital freedom, and a change in the governmental function with regards to sexual issues.\n\nAt the same time, some major social policies have also played an important part. For example, the side effect of the family planning policy is to promote a separation of sexual behavior from [[reproduction|reproductive]] purposes. If a couple can give birth to one child only, sexual behavior is no longer solely practiced to produce babies but also for pleasure. Changes in the legal code have reflected this while also publicly acknowledging sex as a pursuit of happiness.\n\n===Stable economic development and consumerism===\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nUnder recent policies, the social economy has seen stable and sustainable growth, especially in big cities. Material wealth and an increase in [[quality of life]] have brought [[optimism]] and [[consumerism]] which continually send messages to the individual that it is acceptable to seek sexual happiness.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/>\n\nVarious [[sex products]] are now openly sold in the market. Sexual information is spreading directly or indirectly through such public media as street-side [[advertising]]. Fewer people turn away when they see intimate behavior between lovers in public. [[Condom]] [[vending machines]] are seen on [[campuses]]. Products for [[safe sex]] are available in [[convenience stores]] around city. Even major [[radio]] and [[television]] stations have started picking up on sex-related topics. Educational programs on sex have become popular. [[Video shop]]s, big or small, sell sexually oriented films produced either by domestic or foreign directors. More sexual information can also be quickly and easily found on the [[Internet]]. Intermingled information, good or bad, has pushed aside many of the traditional [[sexual taboo]]s and thus shaken the norm of sexual practice.\n\nThe pursuit of [[profit (economics)|profit]] may well push sexual minorities such as [[gay]]s and [[lesbians]] to appeal for their rights not just for legal reasons but also to tap into their particular market niches.<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\"/> In a stable, developing economy and consumer culture, an emphasis on individual enjoyment and a respect for differentiation and diversity are now well established and perhaps even flourishing in an atmosphere of confidence and optimism.\n\n===Growth of the middle class===\nOne very important factor driving the social change in contemporary China is the great changes in and reorganization of social stratification. One of the most important features is [[white collar workers]] \u2014 the rise of the new [[middle class]] in China. The new middle class tends to stress their personal happiness and pay more attention to their own quality of life.\n\nBased on observations, all the visible changes in sexual discourse \u2014 including those in [[gay culture]] \u2014 can be considered a part of middle class culture. Most of the related website owners and participants belong to the white collar workers group. The new lifestyle in sexuality fields such as the [[DINKY|DINK]] \u2014 \"double income, no kids\"\u2014family, single groups, and cohabitating couples who violate the traditional sex norms are led by middle-class people. They are also the target groups for most gay bars, dating parties, so-called \"dating on Saturday\" programs, and sports groups, among others, in [[Chinese cities]].\n\nThe rise and growth of this middle class has the potential to produce various sexual [[emancipation]] discourses, including homosexuality, to break the silence in Chinese society.\n\n===Globalization===\nSince China adopted the policies of opening up and market reform, globalization has meant that there have been many people traveling across countries and from one region to another in China. It means information sharing, product sharing, capital flow, and value sharing, which increasingly includes some basic understanding of sexual rights, [[gender equality]], and [[human rights]]. The country's various projects on sexuality, [[reproductive health]], and [[AIDS prevention]] each have raised people's awareness of sexuality. Some non-profit international or national organizations are also working in China, while at the same time the international academic community, together with Chinese scholars, is sponsoring workshops and conferences for research on sexuality.<ref>Elain Jeffreys (1997) ''Sex and Sexuality in China''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-40143-7}}</ref>\n\n==Popularization of higher education==\n{{See also|National College Entrance Examination}}\n\nPopularization of [[higher education]] has become one of the major changes in [[Education in China|Chinese education]].<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#13 Research and Advanced Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref> According to recent statistics publicized by the [[Shanghai]] Education Commission, the gross entrance rate into higher education in Shanghai is 55 percent, ranking first in the country. [[Beijing]] comes a close second, at 53 percent. In the same year, the nation's gross entrance rate into higher education has not yet reached 19 percent. More than half of the population aged 18 to 22 in Shanghai and Beijing can get access to some form of higher education.\n\nThe impact of higher education has been significant. The younger generation may adopt a different sexual ideology from the older generation because they have more opportunities to get exposure to humanities and [[social sciences]].<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/> They are more geared toward the pursuit of equality, freedom, and self-realization. At the same time, society pays more and more attention to elite [[intellectuals]] such as professors, researchers, lawyers, and policy-making consultants. Their opinions and ideas are expressed to the public in media reports and at conferences. The spreading of knowledge has been the most influential way to eliminate sex discrimination and sex inequality.<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/>\n\n==Feminist discourse in China==\n[[Gender equality]] has been one of China's national policies. The [[Cultural Revolution]] slogan \"Women can hold up half the sky\" is well known. Many organizations and centers for gender were established after the Fourth UN Conference on Women was held in Beijing in 1995.<ref>[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/index.html Fourth World Conference on Women], Beijing, China - September 1995, Action for Equality, Development and Peace.</ref> The government sponsored the conference and then signed the UN documents pledging gender equality, and official women's organizations and feminist activists and scholars have been fighting against gender discrimination and working on achieving gender equality. Their struggle has permeated many aspects of the people's social lives.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#1 Basic Sexological Premises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>\n\nMainstream [[feminist]] discourse in China tends to ignore sexuality issues, considering those topics either unimportant or as stirring up unnecessary trouble. Nevertheless, the critical thinking of feminist discourse has challenged stereotyped gender roles, including sexuality roles. The latter especially has influenced many young people.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>\n\nThe role of feminist discourse in the field of sexuality has been to redefine a woman's sex role. It criticized the double standards of sex between women and men, which included traditionally held norms such as that men should be aggressive and active, women passive and inactive; that men should have stronger sexual desires and women weaker; that men should be sexually experienced before marriage but women retain their virginity; that women should not ask too much for sex and should consider men's satisfaction as their own. The critical feminist discourse is also rewriting the gender views in Chinese society. Some feminist scholars have started to emphasize women's sexual rights and the diversity of sexuality among Chinese women. Thus China's sexual revolution is also women's sexual revolution, as evidenced by these trends.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>\n\nWhile women in previous generations were expected to marry in their twenties, many highly educated women are deciding to hold off on marriage into their 30s or longer. Their increased economic power has given them autonomy so they don't need to rely on a spouse. But the Chinese media has still given them a derogatory name, ''shengnu'' (\u5269\u5973) or \"leftover women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=China's Successful Ladies See Shrinking Pool of Mr. Right|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-women-marriage-education-employment|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, China added new provisions to the ''Law on Women's Right Protection'' to include sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625913.stm |title=China to outlaw sexual harassment |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>  In 2006 \"The Shanghai Supplement\" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Li |first=Cao |last2=South |first2=Mark |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-10/27/content_718147.htm |title=Draft bill details sexual harassment |publisher=China Daily |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>\n\n==Role of the media and the Internet==\nThe [[Media of China|media]] is the catalytic agent of sexual revolution in China. The [[Internet in China|Internet]], too, is one of the most prominent agents wielding important influence among the Chinese people through promoting alliances, sharing knowledge, and providing a platform where various voices can be heard. There are numerous individuals who come to accept their sexual identity mainly because of the Internet. The Internet is a powerful channel for people to find sexual partners, to organize off-line activities, or just simply to have access to sexual knowledge and sex-related information.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69\u201395|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\nThe Internet has also been a great proponent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) identity in China. Since the late 1990s, members of the LGBT community have used the Internet to access and share information, form relationships, and cultivate queer identities and communities. However, despite the seemingly unconstrained development of the LGBT community in the global cyberspace, there are constraints. Some constraints are informed by socio-economic factors. There are some gay, lesbian and queer people who cannot afford a computer and access to the Internet at home and therefore are obliged to use Internet cafes, where they may be compelled to avoid certain websites for fear of being monitored by other people. Some constraints are politically informed. Gay and lesbian-oriented websites tend to be short-lived due to Internet regulations and controls of the government. Furthermore, despite an online proliferation of the LGBT identity, the community remains subordinate to China's hegemonic discourse on sexuality. Rarely do traditional Chinese media outlets recognise LGBT identity, let alone embrace and validate the community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69\u201395|edition=1st|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\n==Sexual revolution==\nIn [[Putonghua|Chinese language]], ''xingkaifang'' ({{linktext|\u6027|\u5f00|\u653e}}) is the phrase to describe the sexual opening-up,<ref name=\"James Farrer\">James Farrer (2002) ''Opening Up: Youth sex culture and market reform in Shanghai'' page 24. {{ISBN|0-226-23871-7}}</ref> \"a [[globalization|globalizing]] sexual culture prevailing China.\"<ref name=\"James Farrer\" />\n[[Urbanization]] in China has been accelerating the sexual revolution by providing people with more private space and freedom to enjoy sex, as compared with what was afforded by the traditional countryside way of life. The [[Internet]] provides even more powerful support and makes it possible for many people to remain [[Anonymity|anonymous]], to surf the Internet from one website to another, to write their own [[blogs]], and to express what they want in an environment where there is much less prying by co-workers, neighbors, or other peer groups and less judgments put upon their behavior.\nHowever, [[Internet censorship in China]] does remain an issue.

It provides both opportunities and risks. Sexuality has to be openly discussed because of AIDS concerns. For example, in the summer of 2005, [[China Central Television]] discussed the topic of AIDS under the title \"Homosexuality: Confronting is Better than Evading.\" Scholars and activists have gained the legitimacy to talk publicly about the so-called \"high risk\" groups such as gay men and sex workers and have been developing strategies to work together with the government, replacing strategies of attacking the \"evil\" with models for caring for those at risk.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>\n\nSexuality, including homosexuality, has started to enter the public forum. The whole process is still ongoing, but it is breaking the silence on sexuality taboos. AIDS concerns also bring funding, and many organizations are working to fight the illness. The related knowledge and information on sexuality is spreading continuously among Chinese people, and it also strongly helps people to overcome the [[stereotypes]], [[bias]] and [[ignorance]] regarding AIDS and sexual health issues.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Homosexuality in China|Homosexuality]] and [[transgender in China]]\n*[[Prostitution in China]]\n*[[HIV/AIDS in China]]\n*[[Feminism in China]]\n*[[Love Land (China)]]\n*[[Taoist sexual practices]]\n*[[Back-up partner]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Evans Harriet (1997) ''Women and Sexuality in China: Dominant Discourses of Female Sexuality and Gender Since 1949''. {{ISBN|0-7456-1398-5}}\n*Elaine Jeffreys (editor) (2006) ''Sex and Sexuality in China''. {{ISBN|0-415-40143-7}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sexuality+in+China+today.-a0168586772 Sexuality in China today]\n*[[YouTube]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQUkv9dB-Dw China's Sexual Revolution]\n\n{{SexGenderPRChina}}\n{{Sexuality by country}}\n{{China topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Human sexuality}}\n", "text_old": "{{Essay|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Love sign at Foreigners Street, Chongqing.JPG|thumb|\"Love\" sign at [[Foreigners' Street]] theme park in [[Chongqing]], southwest [[China]], location of the aborted [[Love Land (China)|Love Land]] sex theme park.]]\n'''Sexuality in China''' has undergone revolutionary changes and this \"[[sexual revolution]]\" still continues today.<ref name=\"IESC Demographics and a Historical Perspective\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#0 Demographics and a Historical Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref> [[China|Chinese]] sexual attitudes, behaviors, ideology, and relations have changed dramatically in the past decade of reform and opening up of the country.<ref name=\"IESC Demographics and a Historical Perspective\"/> Many of these changes have found expression in the public forum through a variety of behaviors and ideas.<ref name=\"IESC Demographics and a Historical Perspective\"/> These include, but are not limited to the following cultural shifts: a separation of [[sex]] and [[marriage]], such as [[premarital sex|pre-]] and [[extramarital sex]]; a separation of sex from [[love]] and [[child-bearing]] such as [[Internet sex]] and [[one-night stands]]; an increase in observable [[sexual diversity]] such as [[homosexuality|homo-]] and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] behavior and [[fetishism]]; an increase in socially acceptable displays and behaviors of female [[sexual desire]]; a boom in the [[sex industry]]; and a more open discussion of sex topics, including [[sex studies]] at colleges, media reports, formal publications, on-line information, extensive [[public health]] education, and [[public displays of affection]].<ref name=\"IESC Demographics and a Historical Perspective\"/>\n\nAs can be seen by these developments, China no longer exerts strict control over personal sexual behavior.<ref>Jiang Leiwen.

Many sex-related issues and personal lifestyles are no longer relegated to the field of [[politics]] and thus exempt from severe legal punishment or moral condemnation. Sex has been returned to the personal sphere under the domain of self-management. These changes can be seen in the weakened interference and control of the government in sex-related areas, strengthened sexual resources in the open market, a diversity of sexual lifestyles, and a strong appeal for sexual rights as human rights.\n\nFor instance, the government's control of personal lives has gradually retreated since the passing of the new marriage registration principles in October 2003, which again simplified the processes of [[marriage]] and [[divorce]]. The committed parties no longer need certification or confirmation from their place of work or the local Resident Committee to get married or divorced. The pre-marital physical, which among other things once contained an indication of the woman's [[virginity]], is no longer obligatory. The new principles reflect a greater respect for human rights, a protection of marital freedom, and a change in the governmental function with regards to sexual issues.\n\nAt the same time, some major social policies have also played an important part. For example, the side effect of the family planning policy is to promote a separation of sexual behavior from [[reproduction|reproductive]] purposes. If a couple can give birth to one child only, sexual behavior is no longer solely practiced to produce babies but also for pleasure. Changes in the legal code have reflected this while also publicly acknowledging sex as a pursuit of happiness.\n\n===Stable economic development and consumerism===\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nUnder recent policies, the social economy has seen stable and sustainable growth, especially in big cities. Material wealth and an increase in [[quality of life]] have brought [[optimism]] and [[consumerism]] which continually send messages to the individual that it is acceptable to seek sexual happiness.<ref name=\"A people's sexual revolution in China\"/>\n\nVarious [[sex products]] are now openly sold in the market. Sexual information is spreading directly or indirectly through such public media as street-side [[advertising]]. Fewer people turn away when they see intimate behavior between lovers in public. [[Condom]] [[vending machines]] are seen on [[campuses]]. Products for [[safe sex]] are available in [[convenience stores]] around city. Even major [[radio]] and [[television]] stations have started picking up on sex-related topics. Educational programs on sex have become popular. [[Video shop]]s, big or small, sell sexually oriented films produced either by domestic or foreign directors. More sexual information can also be quickly and easily found on the [[Internet]]. Intermingled information, good or bad, has pushed aside many of the traditional [[sexual taboo]]s and thus shaken the norm of sexual practice.\n\nThe pursuit of [[profit (economics)|profit]] may well push sexual minorities such as [[gay]]s and [[lesbians]] to appeal for their rights not just for legal reasons but also to tap into their particular market niches.<ref name=\"IESC Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\"/> In a stable, developing economy and consumer culture, an emphasis on individual enjoyment and a respect for differentiation and diversity are now well established and perhaps even flourishing in an atmosphere of confidence and optimism.\n\n===Growth of the middle class===\nOne very important factor driving the social change in contemporary China is the great changes in and reorganization of social stratification. One of the most important features is [[white collar workers]] \u2014 the rise of the new [[middle class]] in China. The new middle class tends to stress their personal happiness and pay more attention to their own quality of life.\n\nBased on observations, all the visible changes in sexual discourse \u2014 including those in [[gay culture]] \u2014 can be considered a part of middle class culture. Most of the related website owners and participants belong to the white collar workers group. The new lifestyle in sexuality fields such as the [[DINKY|DINK]] \u2014 \"double income, no kids\"\u2014family, single groups, and cohabitating couples who violate the traditional sex norms are led by middle-class people. They are also the target groups for most gay bars, dating parties, so-called \"dating on Saturday\" programs, and sports groups, among others, in [[Chinese cities]].\n\nThe rise and growth of this middle class has the potential to produce various sexual [[emancipation]] discourses, including homosexuality, to break the silence in Chinese society.\n\n===Globalization===\nSince China adopted the policies of opening up and market reform, globalization has meant that there have been many people traveling across countries and from one region to another in China. It means information sharing, product sharing, capital flow, and value sharing, which increasingly includes some basic understanding of sexual rights, [[gender equality]], and [[human rights]]. The country's various projects on sexuality, [[reproductive health]], and [[AIDS prevention]] each have raised people's awareness of sexuality. Some non-profit international or national organizations are also working in China, while at the same time the international academic community, together with Chinese scholars, is sponsoring workshops and conferences for research on sexuality.<ref>Elain Jeffreys (1997) ''Sex and Sexuality in China''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-40143-7}}</ref>\n\n==Popularization of higher education==\n{{See also|National College Entrance Examination}}\n\nPopularization of [[higher education]] has become one of the major changes in [[Education in China|Chinese education]].<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#13 Research and Advanced Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref> According to recent statistics publicized by the [[Shanghai]] Education Commission, the gross entrance rate into higher education in Shanghai is 55 percent, ranking first in the country. [[Beijing]] comes a close second, at 53 percent. In the same year, the nation's gross entrance rate into higher education has not yet reached 19 percent. More than half of the population aged 18 to 22 in Shanghai and Beijing can get access to some form of higher education.\n\nThe impact of higher education has been significant. The younger generation may adopt a different sexual ideology from the older generation because they have more opportunities to get exposure to humanities and [[social sciences]].<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/> They are more geared toward the pursuit of equality, freedom, and self-realization. At the same time, society pays more and more attention to elite [[intellectuals]] such as professors, researchers, lawyers, and policy-making consultants. Their opinions and ideas are expressed to the public in media reports and at conferences. The spreading of knowledge has been the most influential way to eliminate sex discrimination and sex inequality.<ref name=\"IESC Research and Advanced Education\"/>\n\n==Feminist discourse in China==\n[[Gender equality]] has been one of China's national policies. The [[Cultural Revolution]] slogan \"Women can hold up half the sky\" is well known. Many organizations and centers for gender were established after the Fourth UN Conference on Women was held in Beijing in 1995.<ref>[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/index.html Fourth World Conference on Women], Beijing, China - September 1995, Action for Equality, Development and Peace.</ref> The government sponsored the conference and then signed the UN documents pledging gender equality, and official women's organizations and feminist activists and scholars have been fighting against gender discrimination and working on achieving gender equality. Their struggle has permeated many aspects of the people's social lives.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\">The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: China, [http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html#1 Basic Sexological Premises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527161901/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/china.html |date=2012-05-27 }}</ref>\n\nMainstream [[feminist]] discourse in China tends to ignore sexuality issues, considering those topics either unimportant or as stirring up unnecessary trouble. Nevertheless, the critical thinking of feminist discourse has challenged stereotyped gender roles, including sexuality roles. The latter especially has influenced many young people.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>\n\nThe role of feminist discourse in the field of sexuality has been to redefine a woman's sex role. It criticized the double standards of sex between women and men, which included traditionally held norms such as that men should be aggressive and active, women passive and inactive; that men should have stronger sexual desires and women weaker; that men should be sexually experienced before marriage but women retain their virginity; that women should not ask too much for sex and should consider men's satisfaction as their own. The critical feminist discourse is also rewriting the gender views in Chinese society. Some feminist scholars have started to emphasize women's sexual rights and the diversity of sexuality among Chinese women. Thus China's sexual revolution is also women's sexual revolution, as evidenced by these trends.<ref name=\"IESC Basic Sexological Premises\"/>\n\nWhile women in previous generations were expected to marry in their twenties, many highly educated women are deciding to hold off on marriage into their 30s or longer. Their increased economic power has given them autonomy so they don't need to rely on a spouse. But the Chinese media has still given them a derogatory name, ''shengnv'' (\u5269\u5973) or \"leftover women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=China's Successful Ladies See Shrinking Pool of Mr. Right|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-women-marriage-education-employment|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, China added new provisions to the ''Law on Women's Right Protection'' to include sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625913.stm |title=China to outlaw sexual harassment |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>  In 2006 \"The Shanghai Supplement\" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Li |first=Cao |last2=South |first2=Mark |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-10/27/content_718147.htm |title=Draft bill details sexual harassment |publisher=China Daily |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref>\n\n==Role of the media and the Internet==\nThe [[Media of China|media]] is the catalytic agent of sexual revolution in China. The [[Internet in China|Internet]], too, is one of the most prominent agents wielding important influence among the Chinese people through promoting alliances, sharing knowledge, and providing a platform where various voices can be heard. There are numerous individuals who come to accept their sexual identity mainly because of the Internet. The Internet is a powerful channel for people to find sexual partners, to organize off-line activities, or just simply to have access to sexual knowledge and sex-related information.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69\u201395|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\nThe Internet has also been a great proponent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) identity in China. Since the late 1990s, members of the LGBT community have used the Internet to access and share information, form relationships, and cultivate queer identities and communities. However, despite the seemingly unconstrained development of the LGBT community in the global cyberspace, there are constraints. Some constraints are informed by socio-economic factors. There are some gay, lesbian and queer people who cannot afford a computer and access to the Internet at home and therefore are obliged to use Internet cafes, where they may be compelled to avoid certain websites for fear of being monitored by other people. Some constraints are politically informed. Gay and lesbian-oriented websites tend to be short-lived due to Internet regulations and controls of the government. Furthermore, despite an online proliferation of the LGBT identity, the community remains subordinate to China's hegemonic discourse on sexuality. Rarely do traditional Chinese media outlets recognise LGBT identity, let alone embrace and validate the community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elaine|last2=Yu|first2=Haiqing|title=Sex in China|date=2015|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=9780745656137|pages=69\u201395|edition=1st|url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745656137}}</ref>\n\n==Sexual revolution==\nIn [[Putonghua|Chinese language]], ''xingkaifang'' ({{linktext|\u6027|\u5f00|\u653e}}) is the phrase to describe the sexual opening-up,<ref name=\"James Farrer\">James Farrer (2002) ''Opening Up: Youth sex culture and market reform in Shanghai'' page 24. {{ISBN|0-226-23871-7}}</ref> \"a [[globalization|globalizing]] sexual culture prevailing China.\"<ref name=\"James Farrer\" />\n[[Urbanization]] in China has been accelerating the sexual revolution by providing people with more private space and freedom to enjoy sex, as compared with what was afforded by the traditional countryside way of life. The [[Internet]] provides even more powerful support and makes it possible for many people to remain [[Anonymity|anonymous]], to surf the Internet from one website to another, to write their own [[blogs]], and to express what they want in an environment where there is much less prying by co-workers, neighbors, or other peer groups and less judgments put upon their behavior.\nHowever, [[Internet censorship in China]] does remain an issue.

It provides both opportunities and risks. Sexuality has to be openly discussed because of AIDS concerns. For example, in the summer of 2005, [[China Central Television]] discussed the topic of AIDS under the title \"Homosexuality: Confronting is Better than Evading.\" Scholars and activists have gained the legitimacy to talk publicly about the so-called \"high risk\" groups such as gay men and sex workers and have been developing strategies to work together with the government, replacing strategies of attacking the \"evil\" with models for caring for those at risk.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>\n\nSexuality, including homosexuality, has started to enter the public forum. The whole process is still ongoing, but it is breaking the silence on sexuality taboos. AIDS concerns also bring funding, and many organizations are working to fight the illness. The related knowledge and information on sexuality is spreading continuously among Chinese people, and it also strongly helps people to overcome the [[stereotypes]], [[bias]] and [[ignorance]] regarding AIDS and sexual health issues.<ref name=\"IESC HIV/AIDS\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Homosexuality in China|Homosexuality]] and [[transgender in China]]\n*[[Prostitution in China]]\n*[[HIV/AIDS in China]]\n*[[Feminism in China]]\n*[[Love Land (China)]]\n*[[Taoist sexual practices]]\n*[[Back-up partner]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Evans Harriet (1997) ''Women and Sexuality in China: Dominant Discourses of Female Sexuality and Gender Since 1949''. {{ISBN|0-7456-1398-5}}\n*Elaine Jeffreys (editor) (2006) ''Sex and Sexuality in China''. {{ISBN|0-415-40143-7}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sexuality+in+China+today.-a0168586772 Sexuality in China today]\n*[[YouTube]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQUkv9dB-Dw China's Sexual Revolution]\n\n{{SexGenderPRChina}}\n{{Sexuality by country}}\n{{China topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Human sexuality}}\n", "name_user": "Tototavros", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality_in_China"}
