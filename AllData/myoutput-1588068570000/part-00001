At some point in the 17th century, however, the tribe began a large-scale migration eastwards into northern [[Nejd]], displacing many other [[bedouin]] tribes in the area, such as Harb and [['Anizzah]] who were forced to move northwards after.  By the 20th century, Mutayr's tribal lands extended from the highlands east of Medina, through the region of [[Al-Qasim]], to the borders of [[Kuwait]].  A rivalry developed between Mutayr and [[Harb tribe|Harb]], who inhabited roughly the same areas as Mutayr, as well as with [['Utaybah]], who had just moved into northern Nejd from Hejaz.\n\nBecause Mutayr were the dominant nomadic tribe of Al-Qaseem, which was the main bone of contention between the clans of [[Al Saud]] and [[Rashidi dynasty|Al Rashid]] vying for control of [[Nejd]] in the early 20th century, Mutayr came to play an important role in the history of Arabia during that era.  Mutayr, then, was led by [[Faisal Al-Dewish]], who frequently changed sides in the conflict between the two Nejdi leaders.  In 1912, the ruler of [[Riyadh]], [[Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud]] undertook to settle the nomads of his realm in newly created villages (''hijras''), where the bedouins were to be indoctrinated into a puritanical form of [[Islam]] and become warriors for Ibn Saud's cause.  These new forces were known as the ''[[Ikhwan Mn ta'allah]]'' (\"Brotherhood\"), and Faisal Al-Dewish had led the Ikhwan movement enthusiastically, providing Ibn Saud with crucial military support. The most important Mutayri settlement was [[al-Artawiyya]], at the northern edge of the [[Dahna desert]].\n\nIn 1920  Al-Dewish  led an attack by the Ikhwan of mutayr on [[Kuwait]] at [[al-Jahra]], and were compelled to withdraw once and for all under [[United Kingdom|British]] pressure.  Later, a Mutayri contingent, led by Al-Dewish, joined with other sections of the Ikhwan in the conquest of the [[Hejaz]] on behalf of Ibn Saud in 1924.  Thereafter, a number of Ikhwan leaders from different tribes, led by Al-Dewish, led a rebellion against Ibn Saud.  The Ikhwan sought to take over the newly conquered provinces for themselves and claimed that Ibn Saud had abandoned the true faith by refraining from attacking the European-ruled territories of [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]].  Ibn Saud, however, defeated the rebels at the [[Battle of Sabilla]] in northeastern Nejd, and Al-Dewish sought with the British in Iraq.  The British, however, handed him over to Ibn Saud.  Al-Dewish was put in prison, and died not long afterwards.\n\nThe tribe has historically been mostly bedouin, with only a few representatives among the settled families of Nejd at the turn of the 20th century.  Today, however, nearly all members of the tribe are settled in the cities and towns of [[Saudi Arabia]], making up to 400 villages across the country and especially [[Riyadh]], [[Medina]] and central region of the country. A large section of the tribe also settled in [[Kuwait]]. Members of the Mutayr tribe are known for their bravery in battle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bedouin]]\n*[[Ikhwan]]\n*[[Ghatafan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Arab tribes in Saudi Arabia}}\n[[Category:Tribes of Arabia]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Saudi Arabia]]\n[[Category:Arab groups]]\n[[Category:Bedouin groups]]\n[[Category:Ghatafan]]\n[[Category:History of the Arabian Peninsula]]\n", "text_old": "'''Al-Mutairi''' ({{Lang-ar|'''\u0645\u0637\u064a\u0631'''}}; also spelled '''Mutair''', '''Mutair''' and '''Mtayr''' other: Al-Mutairi) is one of the largest [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], especially [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]].\n\n== Genealogy ==\n[[Ahmad al-Qalqashandi]] who died in 1418 stated that AlMutair tribe belongs to [[Ghatafan]] who are descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham (the father of Arabs).<ref>Qalqashand\u012b, A\u1e25mad.
