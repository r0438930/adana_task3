It is located in [[Central and Eastern Europe]].\n\nThe Danube was once a long-standing frontier of the [[Roman Empire]], and today flows through 10 countries, more than any other river in the world. Originating in [[Germany]], the Danube flows southeast for {{convert|2,850|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through or bordering [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]] before draining into the [[Black Sea]]. Its [[drainage basin]] extends into nine more countries.\n\nThe Danube river basin is home to fish species such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]], [[huchen]], [[Wels catfish]], [[burbot]] and [[tench]]. It is also home to a large diversity of [[carp]] and [[sturgeon]], as well as [[salmon]] and [[trout]]. A few species of [[euryhaline]] fish, such as European [[European bass|seabass]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], and [[European eel|eel]], inhabit the [[Danube Delta]] and the lower portion of the river.\n\nSince ancient times, the Danube has become a traditional trade route in Europe. Today, {{convert|2,415|km|mi|abbr=on}} of its total length are navigable. The river is also an important source of [[hydropower]] and drinking water.\n\n==Names and etymology==\n''Danube'' is an [[Old European hydronymy|Old European]] river name derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|*''d\u0101nu''}}. Other European river names from the same root include the Dunaj, Dzvina/[[Daugava]], [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Donets]], [[Dnieper]], [[Dniestr]], [[Dysna]] and [[Tana (Norway)|Tana/Deatnu]]. In [[Rigvedic Sanskrit]], ''d\u0101nu'' means \"fluid, dewdrop\" and ''d\u0101nuja'' means \"born from ''d\u0101nu''\" or \"born from dew-drops\". In [[Avestan language|Avestan]], the same word means \"river\". In the [[Rigveda]], ''[[Danu (Asura)|D\u0101nu]]'' once appears as the mother of [[Vrtra]], \"a dragon blocking the course of the rivers\". The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word for Danube is {{wikt-lang|fi|Tonava}}, which is most likely derived from the word for the river in German, {{lang|de|Donau}}. Its [[Sami languages|S\u00e1mi]] name {{lang|smi|Deatnu}} means \"Great River\". It is possible that {{lang|xsc|d\u0101nu}} in [[Scythian language|Scythian]] as in Avestan was a generic word for \"river\": ''Dnieper'' and ''Dniestr'', from ''Danapris'' and ''Danastius'', are presumed to continue Scythian {{lang|xsc|*d\u0101nu apara}} \"far river\" and {{lang|xsc|*d\u0101nu nazdya-}} \"near river\", respectively.<ref name=\"Mallory, J.P 2000. p. 106\">{{cite book |authorlink1=J.

In 1994 the Danube was declared one of ten [[Pan-European corridors|Pan-European transport corridors]], routes in Central and Eastern Europe that required major investment over the following ten to fifteen years. The amount of goods transported on the Danube increased to about 100 million tons in 1987. In 1999, transport on the river was made difficult by the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing]] of three bridges in Serbia during the [[Kosovo War]].

Its lakes and marshes support 45 freshwater fish species. Its wetlands support vast flocks of migratory birds of over 300 species, including the endangered [[pygmy cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax pygmaeus''). These are threatened by rival canalization and drainage schemes such as the [[Bystroye Canal]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==International cooperation==\n===Ecology and environment===\n{{Main|International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River}}\n[[File:Pelicani din Delta Dunarii.PNG|thumb|right|[[Pelicans]] in the Danube Delta, Romania]]\n\nThe International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) is an organization consisting of 14 member states (Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Montenegro and Ukraine) and the [[European Union]]. The commission, established in 1998, deals with the whole Danube river basin, which includes tributaries and the groundwater resources. Its goal is to implement the Danube River Protection Convention by promoting and coordinating sustainable and equitable water management, including conservation, improvement and rational use of waters and the implementation of the EU [[Water Framework Directive]].\n\n===Navigation===\n{{Main|Danube Commission}}\nThe Danube Commission is concerned with the maintenance and improvement of the river's navigation conditions. It was established in 1948 by seven countries bordering the river. Members include representatives from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Serbia, It meets regularly twice a year. It also convenes groups of experts to consider items provided for in the commission's working plans.\n\nThe commission dates to the Paris Conferences of 1856 and 1921, which established for the first time an international regime to safeguard free navigation on the Danube. Today the Commission include riparian and non-riparian states.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Evening at Danube gorge.jpg|thumb|right| [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gates]], Serbia-Romania border]]\n[[File:Dam Serbia Djerdap 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station]], Romania-Serbia]]\nAlthough the [[headwater]]s of the Danube are relatively small today, geologically, the Danube is much older than the [[Rhine]], with which its catchment area competes in today's southern Germany. This has a few interesting geological complications. Since the Rhine is the only river rising in the [[Alps]] mountains which flows north towards the North Sea, an invisible line beginning at [[Piz Lunghin]] divides large parts of southern Germany, which is sometimes referred to as the [[European Watershed]].\n\nBefore the last [[ice age]] in the [[Pleistocene]], the Rhine started at the southwestern tip of the Black Forest, while the waters from the Alps that today feed the Rhine were carried east by the so-called ''Urdonau'' (original Danube). Parts of this ancient river's bed, which was much larger than today's Danube, can still be seen in (now waterless) canyons in today's landscape of the [[Swabian Alb]]. After the [[Upper Rhine valley]] had been eroded, most waters from the Alps changed their direction and began feeding the Rhine. Today's upper Danube is but a meek reflection of the ancient one.\n[[File:Danube Iron Gorge La Cazane.JPG|thumb|The [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]], on the Serbian-Romanian border ([[Iron Gates natural park]] and [[\u0110erdap national park]])]]\nSince the Swabian Alb is largely shaped of porous [[limestone]], and since the Rhine's level is much lower than the Danube's, today subsurface rivers carry much water from the Danube to the Rhine. On many days in the summer, when the Danube carries little water, it completely oozes away noisily into these underground channels at two locations in the Swabian Alb, which are referred to as the Donauversickerung ([[Danube Sinkhole|Danube Sink]]). Most of this water resurfaces only {{convert|12|km|mi|0}} south at the [[Aachtopf]], Germany's wellspring with the highest flow, an average of {{convert|8500|l/s|cuft/s}}, north of [[Lake Constance]]\u2014thus feeding the Rhine. The European Water Divide applies only for those waters that pass beyond this point, and only during the days of the year when the Danube carries enough water to survive the sink holes in the Donauversickerung.\n\nSince such large volumes of underground water erode much of the surrounding limestone, it is estimated that the Danube upper course will one day disappear entirely in favor of the Rhine, an event called [[Stream capture|stream capturing]].\n\nThe hydrological parameters of Danube are regularly monitored in Croatia at [[Batina]], [[Dalj]], [[Vukovar]] and [[Ilok]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hidro.hr/hidro_e.php?id=hidro&param=Podaci_e | title = Daily hydrological report | publisher = [[State Hydrometeorological Bureau of the Republic of Croatia]] | accessdate = 2010-09-09}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Marcus Aurelius]] -->\nThe Danube basin was the site of some of the earliest human cultures. The [[Danubian culture|Danubian Neolithic]] cultures include the [[Linear Pottery culture]]s of the mid-Danube basin. Many sites of the sixth-to-third millennium BC [[Vin\u010da culture]], (Vin\u010da, Serbia) are sited along the Danube. The third millennium BC [[Vu\u010dedol culture]] (from the Vu\u010dedol site near [[Vukovar]], [[Croatia]]) is famous for its ceramics.\n\n[[Darius the Great]], [[Achaemenid Empire|king of Persia]], crossed the river in the late 6th century BC in order to [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|invade European Scythia]] and to subdue the [[Scythians]].\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Triballian king [[Syrmus]] and the northern barbarian Thracian and Illyrian tribes by advancing from Macedonia as far as the Danube in 336 BC.\n\nUnder the Romans the Danube formed the border of the Empire with the tribes to the north almost from its source to its mouth. At the same time it was a route for the transport of troops and the supply of settlements downstream. From AD 37 to the reign of the Emperor [[Valentinian I]] (364\u2013375) the [[Danubian Limes]] was the northeastern border of the Empire, with occasional interruptions such as the fall of the Danubian Limes in 259. The crossing of the Danube into [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] was achieved by the ''Imperium Romanum'', first in two battles in 102 and then in 106 after the construction of a bridge in 101 near the garrison town of [[Drobeta Turnu Severin|Drobeta]] at the Iron Gate. This victory over Dacia under [[Decebalus]] enabled the Province of [[Dacia (province)|Dacia]] to be created, but in 271 it was lost again.\n\n[[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] used the river as their southeastern border in the 6th century.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Trajan's Bridge Across the Danube, Modern Reconstruction.jpg|[[Trajan's Bridge|The oldest bridge across the Danube]], constructed by [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] between 103 and 105 [[Common Era|CE]], directed by [[Trajan]], modern [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]].\nFile:M\u00e1ria Val\u00e9ria\u00b4s bridge.jpg|At [[Esztergom]] and [[\u0160t\u00farovo]], the Danube separates [[Hungary]] from [[Slovakia]]\nFile:Vena 06.jpg|The Danube in [[Vienna]]\nFile:Danube at belene.jpg|The Danube between [[Belene]] and [[Belene Island]], Bulgaria\nFile:Frozen Danube Reichsbr\u00fccke.JPG|A look upstream from the [[Donauinsel]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] during an unusually cold winter (February 2006).

The lower Danube was also called the ''Keras Okeanoio'' (Gulf or Horn of Okeanos) in the ''Argonautica'' by Apollonius Rhodos (Argon. IV. 282). <!-- [needs not only cites but some explanation of relevance, particularly for references to Lithuanian linguistics]{{Or|date=July 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.-->\n\nAt the end of the ''Okeanos Potamos'', is the holy island of Alba (Leuke, Pytho Nisi, Isle of Snakes), sacred to the Pelasgian (and later, Greek) Apollo, greeting the sun rising in the east. [[Hecateus Abderitas]] refers to Apollo's island from the region of the Hyperboreans, in the Okeanos. It was on Leuke, in one version of his legend, that the hero Achilles was buried (to this day, one of the mouths of the Danube is called Chilia). Old Romanian folk songs recount a white monastery on a white island with nine priests.<ref name=Densusianu>[http://www.pelasgians.org/ ''Dacia Preistorica''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707015920/http://www.pelasgians.org/ |date=7 July 2008 }}, Nicolae Densusianu (1913).</ref>\n\n===Rivalry along the Danube===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\n\nBetween the late 14th and late 19th centuries, the [[Ottoman Empire]] competed first with the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom of Serbia]], [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Principality of Wallachia]], [[Principality of Moldavia]] and later with the [[House of Habsburg|Austrian Habsburgs]], [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and [[Russian Empire]] for controlling the Danube (Turks call it ''Tuna''), which became the northern border of the Ottoman Empire for centuries. Many of the [[Ottoman\u2013Hungarian Wars]] (1366\u20131526) and [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars]] (1526\u20131791) were fought along the river.\n\nThe most important [[Ottoman wars in Europe|wars of the Ottoman Empire]] along the Danube include the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] (1396), the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)]], the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (1526), the first Turkish [[Siege of Vienna]] (1529), the [[Siege of Esztergom (1543)]], the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] (1591\u20131606), the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683\u20131699), the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u20131856) and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]].\n\n==Economics==\n===Drinking water===\nAlong its course, the Danube is a source of drinking water for about 20 million people. In [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], Germany, almost 30 percent (as of 2004) of the water for the area between [[Stuttgart]], [[Bad Mergentheim]], [[Aalen]] and [[Alb-Donau (district)]] comes from purified water of the Danube. Other cities such as [[Ulm]] and [[Passau]] also use some water from the Danube.\n\nIn Austria and Hungary, most water is drawn from ground and spring sources, and only in rare cases is water from the Danube used. Most states also find it too difficult to clean the water because of extensive pollution; only parts of Romania where the water is cleaner still obtain drinking water from the Danube on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iawd.at/cms/pages/en/the-danube.php |title=The Danube |publisher=International Association of Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area |accessdate=2012-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519200631/http://www.iawd.at/cms/pages/en/the-danube.php |archivedate=19 May 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Navigation and transport===\n[[File:Fischerzille L\u00fcA 10 m Donau bei Greifenstein Nieder\u00f6sterreich.jpg|thumb|right|Fishing from a Zille on the Danube in Lower Austria, 1982]]\n\nIn the 19th century, the Danube was an important waterway but was, as ''The Times'' of London put it, \"annually swept by ice that will lift a large ship out of the water or cut her in two as if she were a carrot.\"<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1883-02-13-12-001&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1883-02-13-12 \"The Danube,\" ''The Times,'' February 13, 1883, page 12]</ref>\n\nToday, as [[Pan-European corridors|\"Corridor VII\"]] of the [[European Union]], the Danube is an important transport route. Since the opening of the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal|Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal]], the river connects the [[Port of Rotterdam]] and the industrial centres of [[Western Europe]] with the [[Black Sea]] and, also, through the [[Danube&nbsp;\u2013 Black Sea Canal]], with the [[Port of Constan\u021ba]].\n\nThe waterway is designed for large-scale inland vessels ({{nowrap|110 \u00d7 11.45 m}}) but it can carry much larger vessels on most of its course. The Danube has been partly canalized in Germany (5 locks) and Austria (10 locks). Proposals to build a number of new locks to improve navigation have not progressed, due in part to environmental concerns.\n\nDownstream from the [[Freudenau]] locks in Vienna, canalization of the Danube was limited to the [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo - Nagymaros Dams|Gab\u010d\u00edkovo dam]] and locks near Bratislava and the two double [[Iron Gates|Iron Gate]] locks in the border stretch of the Danube between Serbia and Romania. These locks have larger dimensions. Downstream of the Iron Gate, the river is free flowing all the way to the Black Sea, a distance of more than {{convert|860|km|mi}}.\n\nThe Danube connects with the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal at [[Kelheim]], with the [[Donaukanal]] in Vienna, and with the Danube\u2013Black Sea Canal at [[Cernavod\u0103]].\n\nApart from a couple of secondary navigable branches, the only major navigable rivers linked to the Danube are the [[Drava]], [[Sava]] and [[Tisza|Tisa]]. In Serbia, a canal network also connects to the river; the network, known as the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]]s, links sections downstream.\n\nIn the Austrian and German sections of the Danube, a type of flat-bottomed boat called a [[Zille (boat)|Zille]] was developed for use along the river. Zillen are still used today for fishing, ferrying, and other transport of goods and people in this area.\n\n===Fishing===\nThe importance of [[fishing]] on the Danube, which was critical in the [[Middle Ages]], has declined dramatically. Some fishermen are still active at certain points on the river, and the [[Danube Delta]] still has an important industry.\n\nThe Upper Danube [[ecoregion]] alone has about 60 fish species and the Lower Danube\u2013[[Dniester]] ecoregion has about twice as many.<ref name=FEW>Hales, J. (2013). ''[http://www.feow.org/ecoregions/details/417 Upper Danube]''. Freshwater Ecoregions of the World.

Besides the often frequented route between Vienna and Budapest, some ships even go from Passau in Germany to the Danube Delta and back. During the peak season, more than 70 cruise liners are in use on the river, while the traffic-free upper parts can only be discovered with canoes or boats.\n\nThe Danube region is not only culturally and historically of importance, but also due to its fascinating landmarks and sights important for the regional tourism industry. With its well established infrastructure regarding cycling, hiking and travel possibilities, the region along the Danube attracts every year an international clientele. In Austria alone, there are more than 14 million overnight stays and about 6.5 million arrivals per year.<ref name=\"kaiserundkoenige\">{{cite web|url=http://www.strassederkaiserundkoenige.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Brosch%C3%BCren/ARGE_Donau_%C3%96sterreich2013.pdf |title=Press release of the \"ARGE Donau \u00d6sterreich\" |accessdate=2014-04-01 |language=de |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313154833/http://www.strassederkaiserundkoenige.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Brosch%C3%BCren/ARGE_Donau_%C3%96sterreich2013.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe Danube Banks in [[Budapest]] are a part of Unesco World Heritage sites, they can be viewed from a number of sightseeing cruises offered in the city.\n\nThe Danube Bend is also a popular tourist destination.\n\n====Danube Bike Trail====\n[[File:Donauradweg Schloegener Schlinge - Aschach.jpg|thumb|The Danube Bike Trail running along the ''Schl\u00f6gener Schlinge'']]\n[[File:LinzDonaulaende.jpg|thumb|The Danube Bike Trail leading through the city [[Linz]]]]\nThe [[Donauradweg|Danube Bike Trail]] (also called Danube Cycle Path or the ''Donauradweg'') is a bicycle trail along the river.

It continues to [[Engelhartszell an der Donau|Engelhartszell]], with the only [[Engelszell Abbey|Trappist monastery]] in Austria. Further highlight-stops along the Danube, include the \"Schl\u00f6gener Schlinge\", the city of Linz, which was [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2009 with its contemporary art richness, the [[Melk Abbey]], the university city of [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]] and the cosmopolitan city of Vienna. Before the Route of Emperors and Kings ends, you pass Bratislava and Budapest, the latter which was seen as the twin town of Vienna during the times of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\nSince [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman times]], famous emperors and their retinue travelled on and along the Danube and used the river for travel and transportation. While travelling on the mainland was quite exhausting, most people preferred to travel by ship on the Danube. So the Route of Emperors and Kings was the setting for many important historical events, which characterize the Danube up until today.\n\nThe route got its name from the [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I]] of Barbarossa and the [[Crusades|crusaders]] as well as from [[Richard I of England]] who had been jailed in the [[Burgruine D\u00fcrnstein|D\u00fcrnstein Castle]], which is situated above the Danube. The most imperial journeys throughout time were those of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg family]]. Once crowned in [[Frankfurt]], the emperors ruled from Vienna and also held in Regensburg the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg]]. Many famous castles, palaces, residences and state-run convents where built by the Habsburger along the river. Nowadays they still remind us of the bold architecture of the \"Donaubarock\".\n\nToday, people can not only travel by boat on the Danube, but also by train, by bike on the Danube Bike Trail or walk on the \"Donausteig\" and visit the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage cities]] of Regensburg, [[Wachau]] and Vienna.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Route of Emperors and Kings |url=https://www.bavaria.by/the-route-of-emperors-and-kings |accessdate=29 March 2014 |website=www.bavaria.by}}</ref>\n\n==Important national parks==\n* Naturpark Obere Donau (Germany)\n* Donauauen zwischen Neuburg und Ingolstadt (Germany) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023161527/http://danubemap.eu/donauauwald map]\n* Nature protection area Donauleiten (Germany)\n* Nationalpark Donau Auen (Austria) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023161522/http://danubemap.eu/donauauen map]\n* Chr\u00e1nen\u00e1 krajinn\u00e1 oblas\u0165 Dunajsk\u00e9 luhy (Slovakia) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111021055315/http://danubemap.eu/dunajskeluhy map]\n* [[Danube-Ipoly National Park]] (Hungary) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111021055252/http://danubemap.eu/dunaipoly map]\n* [[Danube-Drava National Park]] (Hungary) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023101801/http://danubemap.eu/dunadrava map]\n* Naturalpark [[Kopa\u010dki Rit]] (Croatia) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023110151/http://danubemap.eu/kopackirit map]\n* [[Gornje Podunavlje]] Nature Reserve (Serbia) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111024011005/http://danubemap.eu/podunavlje map]\n* [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] National Park (Serbia)\n* [[Koviljsko-petrovaradinski rit]] Nature Reserve (Serbia)\n* [[Great War Island]] Nature Reserve (Serbia)\n* [[\u0110erdap National park]] (Serbia)\n* [[Iron Gates Natural Park]] (Romania)\n* [[Persina Nature Park]] (Bulgaria) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023161537/http://danubemap.eu/persina map]\n* [[Kalimok-Brushlen Protected Site]] (Bulgaria) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023110144/http://danubemap.eu/kalimok map]\n* [[Srebarna Nature Reserve]] (Bulgaria) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111024012109/http://danubemap.eu/srebarna map]\n* [[M\u0103cin Mountains]] Natural Park (Romania)\n* [[Small Island of Br\u0103ila]] Natural Park (Romania)\n* [[Danube Delta]] Biosphere Reserve (Romania) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023101756/http://danubemap.eu/delta map]\n* Danube Biosphere Reserve in Ukraine\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Gornje Podunavlje.jpg|[[Gornje Podunavlje]] Special Nature Reserve in [[Serbia]].\nFile:Golubaccas.jpg|[[Golubac Fortress]] in [[\u0110erdap National park]], [[Serbia]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Cultural significance==\n{{prose|date=May 2012}}\n[[File:Danube Landscape near Regensburg.JPG|thumb|right|16th-century Danube landscape near [[Regensburg]], by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] - a member of the [[Danube school]].]]\n\n* The Danube is mentioned in the title of a famous [[waltz]] by [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[composer]] [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]], ''[[The Blue Danube|An der sch\u00f6nen, blauen Donau]]'' (''On the Beautiful Blue Danube''). This piece is well known across the world and is also used widely as a [[lullaby]]. ''[[The Waves of the Danube]]'' ({{lang-ro|Valurile Dun\u0103rii}}) is a waltz by the Romanian composer [[Iosif Ivanovici]] (1845\u20131902); as the [[Anniversary Song|Anniversary '''Song''']], it has been performed by many vocalists, such as [[Al Jolson]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Vera Lynn]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], and countless others. [It is most commonly known as the [[Anniversary Waltz|Anniversary '''Waltz''']], though that is actually a different song and melody.] [[Joe Zawinul]] wrote a [[symphony]] about the Danube called ''[[Stories of the Danube]]''. It was performed for the first time at the 1993 [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] festival, at [[Linz]].\n* In 2008, the Finnish indie rock band [[Wiidakko]] released a song called ''Tonava'' (Danube in Finnish) on their second album ''Asiat joita et voi koskaan saavuttaa''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ES9xlnZTM|title=Wiidakko - Tonava|last=wiidakko|date=18 November 2013|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n* The Danube figures prominently in the [[Mila Rodino|Bulgarian National Anthem]], as a symbolic representation of the country's natural beauty. In [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] folklore songs appearance of Danube (Dunojus, Dunoj\u0117lis) is more common than the appearance of the longest Lithuanian river [[Neman]].\n* The German tradition of landscape painting, the [[Danube school]], was developed in the Danube valley in the 16th century.\n* One of [[Claudio Magris]]'s masterpieces is called ''Danube'' ({{ISBN|1-86046-823-3}}). The book, published in 1986, is a large cultural-historical essay, in which Magris travels the Danube from the very first sources to the delta, tracing the rich European ethnic and cultural heritage, literary and ideological past and present along the way.\n* [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[The Danube Pilot]]'' (1908) (''Le Pilote du Danube'') depicts the adventures of fisherman Serge Ladko as he travels down the river. [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s [[The Willows (story)|''The Willows'']], about a boat excursion on the river, is considered one of the greatest stories in the literature of the supernatural.\n* The river is the subject of the film ''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]'' (2004). \n* Parts of the German road movie ''[[Im Juli]]'' take place along the Danube. In Nicolas Roeg's 1980 film ''[[Bad Timing]]'', the border crossing over the Danube between Bratislava and Vienna is a recurring site in which the romance between Milena (Teresa Russell), Alex (Art Garfunkel) and Milena's husband Stefan (Denholm Elliot) is played out.\n* In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the [[Danube class starship|''Danube''-class runabout]] is a type of [[starship]] used by the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[Starfleet]], most notably in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' series.\n* The river is mentioned a great number of times throughout the [[Earth's Children]] Saga by [[Jean M. Auel]], especially in the book ''[[The Plains of Passage]]'', when the main characters [[Ayla (Earth's Children)|Ayla]] and [[Jondalar]] travel west along this river, which they call the Great Mother River, due to its big size.\n* [[Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3]]'s film the ''[[Blue Danube Waltz]]'' (1992)\n* The Hungarian sweet speciality [[Duna kavics]] (\"Danube pebbles\") is named after the river.\n* A Hungarian folk ensemble, the [[Danube Folk Ensemble]] (Duna M\u0171v\u00e9szegy\u00fcttes), is named after the river.

languages]]}}) is Europe's [[List of rivers of Europe#Longest rivers|second longest river]], after the [[Volga River|Volga]]. It is located in [[Central and Eastern Europe]].\n\nThe Danube was once a long-standing frontier of the [[Roman Empire]], and today flows through 10 countries, more than any other river in the world. Originating in [[Germany]], the Danube flows southeast for {{convert|2,850|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through or bordering [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]] before draining into the [[Black Sea]]. Its [[drainage basin]] extends into nine more countries.\n\nThe Danube river basin is home to fish species such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]], [[huchen]], [[Wels catfish]], [[burbot]] and [[tench]]. It is also home to a large diversity of [[carp]] and [[sturgeon]], as well as [[salmon]] and [[trout]]. A few species of [[euryhaline]] fish, such as European [[European bass|seabass]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], and [[European eel|eel]], inhabit the [[Danube Delta]] and the lower portion of the river.\n\nSince ancient times, the Danube has become a traditional trade route in Europe. Today, {{convert|2,415|km|mi|abbr=on}} of its total length are navigable. The river is also an important source of [[hydropower]] and drinking water.\n\n==Names and etymology==\n''Danube'' is an [[Old European hydronymy|Old European]] river name derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|*''d\u0101nu''}}. Other European river names from the same root include the Dunaj, Dzvina/[[Daugava]], [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Donets]], [[Dnieper]], [[Dniestr]], [[Dysna]] and [[Tana (Norway)|Tana/Deatnu]]. In [[Rigvedic Sanskrit]], ''d\u0101nu'' means \"fluid, dewdrop\" and ''d\u0101nuja'' means \"born from ''d\u0101nu''\" or \"born from dew-drops\". In [[Avestan language|Avestan]], the same word means \"river\". In the [[Rigveda]], ''[[Danu (Asura)|D\u0101nu]]'' once appears as the mother of [[Vrtra]], \"a dragon blocking the course of the rivers\". The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word for Danube is {{wikt-lang|fi|Tonava}}, which is most likely derived from the word for the river in German, {{lang|de|Donau}}. Its [[Sami languages|S\u00e1mi]] name {{lang|smi|Deatnu}} means \"Great River\". It is possible that {{lang|xsc|d\u0101nu}} in [[Scythian language|Scythian]] as in Avestan was a generic word for \"river\": ''Dnieper'' and ''Dniestr'', from ''Danapris'' and ''Danastius'', are presumed to continue Scythian {{lang|xsc|*d\u0101nu apara}} \"far river\" and {{lang|xsc|*d\u0101nu nazdya-}} \"near river\", respectively.<ref name=\"Mallory, J.P 2000. p. 106\">{{cite book |authorlink1=J.

Its lakes and marshes support 45 freshwater fish species. Its wetlands support vast flocks of migratory birds of over 300 species, including the endangered [[pygmy cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax pygmaeus''). These are threatened by rival canalization and drainage schemes such as the [[Bystroye Canal]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==International cooperation==\n===Ecology and environment===\n{{Main|International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River}}\n[[File:Pelicani din Delta Dunarii.PNG|thumb|right|[[Pelicans]] in the Danube Delta, Romania]]\n\nThe International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) is an organization consisting of 14 member states (Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Montenegro and Ukraine) and the [[European Union]]. The commission, established in 1998, deals with the whole Danube river basin, which includes tributaries and the groundwater resources. Its goal is to implement the Danube River Protection Convention by promoting and coordinating sustainable and equitable water management, including conservation, improvement and rational use of waters and the implementation of the EU [[Water Framework Directive]].\n\n===Navigation===\n{{Main|Danube Commission}}\nThe Danube Commission is concerned with the maintenance and improvement of the river's navigation conditions. It was established in 1948 by seven countries bordering the river. Members include representatives from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Serbia, It meets regularly twice a year. It also convenes groups of experts to consider items provided for in the commission's working plans.\n\nThe commission dates to the Paris Conferences of 1856 and 1921, which established for the first time an international regime to safeguard free navigation on the Danube. Today the Commission include riparian and non-riparian states.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Evening at Danube gorge.jpg|thumb|right| [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gates]], Serbia-Romania border]]\n[[File:Dam Serbia Djerdap 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station]], Romania-Serbia]]\nAlthough the [[headwater]]s of the Danube are relatively small today, geologically, the Danube is much older than the [[Rhine]], with which its catchment area competes in today's southern Germany. This has a few interesting geological complications. Since the Rhine is the only river rising in the [[Alps]] mountains which flows north towards the North Sea, an invisible line beginning at [[Piz Lunghin]] divides large parts of southern Germany, which is sometimes referred to as the [[European Watershed]].\n\nBefore the last [[ice age]] in the [[Pleistocene]], the Rhine started at the southwestern tip of the Black Forest, while the waters from the Alps that today feed the Rhine were carried east by the so-called ''Urdonau'' (original Danube). Parts of this ancient river's bed, which was much larger than today's Danube, can still be seen in (now waterless) canyons in today's landscape of the [[Swabian Alb]]. After the [[Upper Rhine valley]] had been eroded, most waters from the Alps changed their direction and began feeding the Rhine. Today's upper Danube is but a meek reflection of the ancient one.\n[[File:Danube Iron Gorge La Cazane.JPG|thumb|The [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]], on the Serbian-Romanian border ([[Iron Gates natural park]] and [[\u0110erdap national park]])]]\nSince the Swabian Alb is largely shaped of porous [[limestone]], and since the Rhine's level is much lower than the Danube's, today subsurface rivers carry much water from the Danube to the Rhine. On many days in the summer, when the Danube carries little water, it completely oozes away noisily into these underground channels at two locations in the Swabian Alb, which are referred to as the Donauversickerung ([[Danube Sinkhole|Danube Sink]]). Most of this water resurfaces only {{convert|12|km|mi|0}} south at the [[Aachtopf]], Germany's wellspring with the highest flow, an average of {{convert|8500|l/s|cuft/s}}, north of [[Lake Constance]]\u2014thus feeding the Rhine. The European Water Divide applies only for those waters that pass beyond this point, and only during the days of the year when the Danube carries enough water to survive the sink holes in the Donauversickerung.\n\nSince such large volumes of underground water erode much of the surrounding limestone, it is estimated that the Danube upper course will one day disappear entirely in favor of the Rhine, an event called [[Stream capture|stream capturing]].\n\nThe hydrological parameters of Danube are regularly monitored in Croatia at [[Batina]], [[Dalj]], [[Vukovar]] and [[Ilok]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hidro.hr/hidro_e.php?id=hidro&param=Podaci_e | title = Daily hydrological report | publisher = [[State Hydrometeorological Bureau of the Republic of Croatia]] | accessdate = 2010-09-09}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Marcus Aurelius]] -->\nThe Danube basin was the site of some of the earliest human cultures. The [[Danubian culture|Danubian Neolithic]] cultures include the [[Linear Pottery culture]]s of the mid-Danube basin. Many sites of the sixth-to-third millennium BC [[Vin\u010da culture]], (Vin\u010da, Serbia) are sited along the Danube. The third millennium BC [[Vu\u010dedol culture]] (from the Vu\u010dedol site near [[Vukovar]], [[Croatia]]) is famous for its ceramics.\n\n[[Darius the Great]], [[Achaemenid Empire|king of Persia]], crossed the river in the late 6th century BC in order to [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|invade European Scythia]] and to subdue the [[Scythians]].\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Triballian king [[Syrmus]] and the northern barbarian Thracian and Illyrian tribes by advancing from Macedonia as far as the Danube in 336 BC.\n\nUnder the Romans the Danube formed the border of the Empire with the tribes to the north almost from its source to its mouth. At the same time it was a route for the transport of troops and the supply of settlements downstream. From AD 37 to the reign of the Emperor [[Valentinian I]] (364\u2013375) the [[Danubian Limes]] was the northeastern border of the Empire, with occasional interruptions such as the fall of the Danubian Limes in 259. The crossing of the Danube into [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] was achieved by the ''Imperium Romanum'', first in two battles in 102 and then in 106 after the construction of a bridge in 101 near the garrison town of [[Drobeta Turnu Severin|Drobeta]] at the Iron Gate. This victory over Dacia under [[Decebalus]] enabled the Province of [[Dacia (province)|Dacia]] to be created, but in 271 it was lost again.\n\n[[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] used the river as their southeastern border in the 6th century.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Trajan's Bridge Across the Danube, Modern Reconstruction.jpg|[[Trajan's Bridge|The oldest bridge across the Danube]], constructed by [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] between 103 and 105 [[Common Era|CE]], directed by [[Trajan]], modern [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]].\nFile:M\u00e1ria Val\u00e9ria\u00b4s bridge.jpg|At [[Esztergom]] and [[\u0160t\u00farovo]], the Danube separates [[Hungary]] from [[Slovakia]]\nFile:Vena 06.jpg|The Danube in [[Vienna]]\nFile:Danube at belene.jpg|The Danube between [[Belene]] and [[Belene Island]], Bulgaria\nFile:Frozen Danube Reichsbr\u00fccke.JPG|A look upstream from the [[Donauinsel]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] during an unusually cold winter (February 2006).

The lower Danube was also called the ''Keras Okeanoio'' (Gulf or Horn of Okeanos) in the ''Argonautica'' by Apollonius Rhodos (Argon. IV. 282). <!-- [needs not only cites but some explanation of relevance, particularly for references to Lithuanian linguistics]{{Or|date=July 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.-->\n\nAt the end of the ''Okeanos Potamos'', is the holy island of Alba (Leuke, Pytho Nisi, Isle of Snakes), sacred to the Pelasgian (and later, Greek) Apollo, greeting the sun rising in the east. [[Hecateus Abderitas]] refers to Apollo's island from the region of the Hyperboreans, in the Okeanos. It was on Leuke, in one version of his legend, that the hero Achilles was buried (to this day, one of the mouths of the Danube is called Chilia).

Many of the [[Ottoman\u2013Hungarian Wars]] (1366\u20131526) and [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars]] (1526\u20131791) were fought along the river.\n\nThe most important [[Ottoman wars in Europe|wars of the Ottoman Empire]] along the Danube include the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] (1396), the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)]], the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (1526), the first Turkish [[Siege of Vienna]] (1529), the [[Siege of Esztergom (1543)]], the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] (1591\u20131606), the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683\u20131699), the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u20131856) and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]].\n\n==Economics==\n===Drinking water===\nAlong its course, the Danube is a source of drinking water for about 20 million people. In [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], Germany, almost 30 percent (as of 2004) of the water for the area between [[Stuttgart]], [[Bad Mergentheim]], [[Aalen]] and [[Alb-Donau (district)]] comes from purified water of the Danube. Other cities such as [[Ulm]] and [[Passau]] also use some water from the Danube.\n\nIn Austria and Hungary, most water is drawn from ground and spring sources, and only in rare cases is water from the Danube used. Most states also find it too difficult to clean the water because of extensive pollution; only parts of Romania where the water is cleaner still obtain drinking water from the Danube on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iawd.at/cms/pages/en/the-danube.php |title=The Danube |publisher=International Association of Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area |accessdate=2012-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519200631/http://www.iawd.at/cms/pages/en/the-danube.php |archivedate=19 May 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Navigation and transport===\n[[File:Fischerzille L\u00fcA 10 m Donau bei Greifenstein Nieder\u00f6sterreich.jpg|thumb|right|Fishing from a Zille on the Danube in Lower Austria, 1982]]\n\nIn the 19th century, the Danube was an important waterway but was, as ''The Times'' of London put it, \"annually swept by ice that will lift a large ship out of the water or cut her in two as if she were a carrot.\"<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1883-02-13-12-001&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1883-02-13-12 \"The Danube,\" ''The Times,'' February 13, 1883, page 12]</ref>\n\nToday, as [[Pan-European corridors|\"Corridor VII\"]] of the [[European Union]], the Danube is an important transport route. Since the opening of the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal|Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal]], the river connects the [[Port of Rotterdam]] and the industrial centres of [[Western Europe]] with the [[Black Sea]] and, also, through the [[Danube&nbsp;\u2013 Black Sea Canal]], with the [[Port of Constan\u021ba]].\n\nThe waterway is designed for large-scale inland vessels ({{nowrap|110 \u00d7 11.45 m}}) but it can carry much larger vessels on most of its course. The Danube has been partly canalized in Germany (5 locks) and Austria (10 locks). Proposals to build a number of new locks to improve navigation have not progressed, due in part to environmental concerns.\n\nDownstream from the [[Freudenau]] locks in Vienna, canalization of the Danube was limited to the [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo - Nagymaros Dams|Gab\u010d\u00edkovo dam]] and locks near Bratislava and the two double [[Iron Gates|Iron Gate]] locks in the border stretch of the Danube between Serbia and Romania. These locks have larger dimensions. Downstream of the Iron Gate, the river is free flowing all the way to the Black Sea, a distance of more than {{convert|860|km|mi}}.\n\nThe Danube connects with the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal at [[Kelheim]], with the [[Donaukanal]] in Vienna, and with the Danube\u2013Black Sea Canal at [[Cernavod\u0103]].\n\nApart from a couple of secondary navigable branches, the only major navigable rivers linked to the Danube are the [[Drava]], [[Sava]] and [[Tisza|Tisa]]. In Serbia, a canal network also connects to the river; the network, known as the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]]s, links sections downstream.\n\nIn the Austrian and German sections of the Danube, a type of flat-bottomed boat called a [[Zille (boat)|Zille]] was developed for use along the river. Zillen are still used today for fishing, ferrying, and other transport of goods and people in this area.\n\n===Fishing===\nThe importance of [[fishing]] on the Danube, which was critical in the [[Middle Ages]], has declined dramatically. Some fishermen are still active at certain points on the river, and the [[Danube Delta]] still has an important industry.\n\nThe Upper Danube [[ecoregion]] alone has about 60 fish species and the Lower Danube\u2013[[Dniester]] ecoregion has about twice as many.<ref name=FEW>Hales, J. (2013). ''[http://www.feow.org/ecoregions/details/417 Upper Danube]''. Freshwater Ecoregions of the World.

Besides the often frequented route between Vienna and Budapest, some ships even go from Passau in Germany to the Danube Delta and back. During the peak season, more than 70 cruise liners are in use on the river, while the traffic-free upper parts can only be discovered with canoes or boats.\n\nThe Danube region is not only culturally and historically of importance, but also due to its fascinating landmarks and sights important for the regional tourism industry. With its well established infrastructure regarding cycling, hiking and travel possibilities, the region along the Danube attracts every year an international clientele. In Austria alone, there are more than 14 million overnight stays and about 6.5 million arrivals per year.<ref name=\"kaiserundkoenige\">{{cite web|url=http://www.strassederkaiserundkoenige.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Brosch%C3%BCren/ARGE_Donau_%C3%96sterreich2013.pdf |title=Press release of the \"ARGE Donau \u00d6sterreich\" |accessdate=2014-04-01 |language=de |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313154833/http://www.strassederkaiserundkoenige.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Brosch%C3%BCren/ARGE_Donau_%C3%96sterreich2013.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe Danube Banks in [[Budapest]] are a part of Unesco World Heritage sites, they can be viewed from a number of sightseeing cruises offered in the city.\n\nThe Danube Bend is also a popular tourist destination.\n\n====Danube Bike Trail====\n[[File:Donauradweg Schloegener Schlinge - Aschach.jpg|thumb|The Danube Bike Trail running along the ''Schl\u00f6gener Schlinge'']]\n[[File:LinzDonaulaende.jpg|thumb|The Danube Bike Trail leading through the city [[Linz]]]]\nThe [[Donauradweg|Danube Bike Trail]] (also called Danube Cycle Path or the ''Donauradweg'') is a bicycle trail along the river.

It continues to [[Engelhartszell an der Donau|Engelhartszell]], with the only [[Engelszell Abbey|Trappist monastery]] in Austria. Further highlight-stops along the Danube, include the \"Schl\u00f6gener Schlinge\", the city of Linz, which was [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2009 with its contemporary art richness, the [[Melk Abbey]], the university city of [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]] and the cosmopolitan city of Vienna. Before the Route of Emperors and Kings ends, you pass Bratislava and Budapest, the latter which was seen as the twin town of Vienna during the times of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\nSince [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman times]], famous emperors and their retinue travelled on and along the Danube and used the river for travel and transportation. While travelling on the mainland was quite exhausting, most people preferred to travel by ship on the Danube. So the Route of Emperors and Kings was the setting for many important historical events, which characterize the Danube up until today.\n\nThe route got its name from the [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I]] of Barbarossa and the [[Crusades|crusaders]] as well as from [[Richard I of England]] who had been jailed in the [[Burgruine D\u00fcrnstein|D\u00fcrnstein Castle]], which is situated above the Danube. The most imperial journeys throughout time were those of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg family]]. Once crowned in [[Frankfurt]], the emperors ruled from Vienna and also held in Regensburg the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg]]. Many famous castles, palaces, residences and state-run convents where built by the Habsburger along the river. Nowadays they still remind us of the bold architecture of the \"Donaubarock\".\n\nToday, people can not only travel by boat on the Danube, but also by train, by bike on the Danube Bike Trail or walk on the \"Donausteig\" and visit the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage cities]] of Regensburg, [[Wachau]] and Vienna.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Route of Emperors and Kings |url=https://www.bavaria.by/the-route-of-emperors-and-kings |accessdate=29 March 2014 |website=www.bavaria.by}}</ref>\n\n==Important national parks==\n* Naturpark Obere Donau (Germany)\n* Donauauen zwischen Neuburg und Ingolstadt (Germany) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023161527/http://danubemap.eu/donauauwald map]\n* Nature protection area Donauleiten (Germany)\n* Nationalpark Donau Auen (Austria) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023161522/http://danubemap.eu/donauauen map]\n* Chr\u00e1nen\u00e1 krajinn\u00e1 oblas\u0165 Dunajsk\u00e9 luhy (Slovakia) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111021055315/http://danubemap.eu/dunajskeluhy map]\n* [[Danube-Ipoly National Park]] (Hungary) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111021055252/http://danubemap.eu/dunaipoly map]\n* [[Danube-Drava National Park]] (Hungary) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023101801/http://danubemap.eu/dunadrava map]\n* Naturalpark [[Kopa\u010dki Rit]] (Croatia) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023110151/http://danubemap.eu/kopackirit map]\n* [[Gornje Podunavlje]] Nature Reserve (Serbia) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111024011005/http://danubemap.eu/podunavlje map]\n* [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] National Park (Serbia)\n* [[Koviljsko-petrovaradinski rit]] Nature Reserve (Serbia)\n* [[Great War Island]] Nature Reserve (Serbia)\n* [[\u0110erdap National park]] (Serbia)\n* [[Iron Gates Natural Park]] (Romania)\n* [[Persina Nature Park]] (Bulgaria) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023161537/http://danubemap.eu/persina map]\n* [[Kalimok-Brushlen Protected Site]] (Bulgaria) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023110144/http://danubemap.eu/kalimok map]\n* [[Srebarna Nature Reserve]] (Bulgaria) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111024012109/http://danubemap.eu/srebarna map]\n* [[M\u0103cin Mountains]] Natural Park (Romania)\n* [[Small Island of Br\u0103ila]] Natural Park (Romania)\n* [[Danube Delta]] Biosphere Reserve (Romania) \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111023101756/http://danubemap.eu/delta map]\n* Danube Biosphere Reserve in Ukraine\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Gornje Podunavlje.jpg|[[Gornje Podunavlje]] Special Nature Reserve in [[Serbia]].\nFile:Golubaccas.jpg|[[Golubac Fortress]] in [[\u0110erdap National park]], [[Serbia]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Cultural significance==\n{{prose|date=May 2012}}\n[[File:Danube Landscape near Regensburg.JPG|thumb|right|16th-century Danube landscape near [[Regensburg]], by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] - a member of the [[Danube school]].]]\n\n* The Danube is mentioned in the title of a famous [[waltz]] by [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[composer]] [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]], ''[[The Blue Danube|An der sch\u00f6nen, blauen Donau]]'' (''On the Beautiful Blue Danube''). This piece is well known across the world and is also used widely as a [[lullaby]]. ''[[The Waves of the Danube]]'' ({{lang-ro|Valurile Dun\u0103rii}}) is a waltz by the Romanian composer [[Iosif Ivanovici]] (1845\u20131902); as the [[Anniversary Song|Anniversary '''Song''']], it has been performed by many vocalists, such as [[Al Jolson]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Vera Lynn]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], and countless others. [It is most commonly known as the [[Anniversary Waltz|Anniversary '''Waltz''']], though that is actually a different song and melody.] [[Joe Zawinul]] wrote a [[symphony]] about the Danube called ''[[Stories of the Danube]]''. It was performed for the first time at the 1993 [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] festival, at [[Linz]].\n* In 2008, the Finnish indie rock band [[Wiidakko]] released a song called ''Tonava'' (Danube in Finnish) on their second album ''Asiat joita et voi koskaan saavuttaa''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20ES9xlnZTM|title=Wiidakko - Tonava|last=wiidakko|date=18 November 2013|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n* The Danube figures prominently in the [[Mila Rodino|Bulgarian National Anthem]], as a symbolic representation of the country's natural beauty. In [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] folklore songs appearance of Danube (Dunojus, Dunoj\u0117lis) is more common than the appearance of the longest Lithuanian river [[Neman]].\n* The German tradition of landscape painting, the [[Danube school]], was developed in the Danube valley in the 16th century.\n* One of [[Claudio Magris]]'s masterpieces is called ''Danube'' ({{ISBN|1-86046-823-3}}). The book, published in 1986, is a large cultural-historical essay, in which Magris travels the Danube from the very first sources to the delta, tracing the rich European ethnic and cultural heritage, literary and ideological past and present along the way.\n* [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[The Danube Pilot]]'' (1908) (''Le Pilote du Danube'') depicts the adventures of fisherman Serge Ladko as he travels down the river. [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s [[The Willows (story)|''The Willows'']], about a boat excursion on the river, is considered one of the greatest stories in the literature of the supernatural.\n* The river is the subject of the film ''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]'' (2004). \n* Parts of the German road movie ''[[Im Juli]]'' take place along the Danube. In Nicolas Roeg's 1980 film ''[[Bad Timing]]'', the border crossing over the Danube between Bratislava and Vienna is a recurring site in which the romance between Milena (Teresa Russell), Alex (Art Garfunkel) and Milena's husband Stefan (Denholm Elliot) is played out.\n* In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the [[Danube class starship|''Danube''-class runabout]] is a type of [[starship]] used by the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[Starfleet]], most notably in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' series.\n* The river is mentioned a great number of times throughout the [[Earth's Children]] Saga by [[Jean M. Auel]], especially in the book ''[[The Plains of Passage]]'', when the main characters [[Ayla (Earth's Children)|Ayla]] and [[Jondalar]] travel west along this river, which they call the Great Mother River, due to its big size.\n* [[Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3]]'s film the ''[[Blue Danube Waltz]]'' (1992)\n* The Hungarian sweet speciality [[Duna kavics]] (\"Danube pebbles\") is named after the river.\n* A Hungarian folk ensemble, the [[Danube Folk Ensemble]] (Duna M\u0171v\u00e9szegy\u00fcttes), is named after the river.
