{"title_page": "Mass killings under communist regimes", "text_new": "{{short description|Communist killings of civilians}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=May 2014}}\n{{communism sidebar}}\nMany [[Mass killing|mass killings]] occurred under 20th-century [[Communist state|communist regimes]]. Death estimates vary widely, depending on the definitions of deaths included. The higher estimates of mass killings account for crimes against civilians by governments, including executions, destruction of population through man-made hunger and deaths during forced deportations, imprisonment and through forced labor. Terms used to define these killings include \"mass killing\", \"[[democide]]\", \"[[politicide]]\", \"[[classicide]]\" and a broad definition of \"[[genocide]]\".\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{see also|Genocide definitions}}\nSeveral different terms are used to describe the intentional killing of large numbers of noncombatants{{sfn|Wheatcroft|1996|pp=1320-1321}}{{efn|name=Krain terms 1997}}{{efn|name=Valentino terms 2005}}{{efn|name=Karlsson terms 2008}}{{efn|name=Semelin terms 2009a}} and according to Professor Anton Weiss-Wendt there is no consensus in the field of comparative genocide studies on a definition of \"genocide\".{{efn|name=Weiss-Wendt terms 2008}} The following terminology has been used by individual authors to describe mass killings of unarmed civilians by [[communist state|communist governments]], individually or as a whole:\n* [[Genocide]] \u2013 under the [[Genocide Convention]], the [[Genocide#Genocide as a crime|crime of genocide]] generally applies to mass murder of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] rather than political or social groups. Protection of political groups was eliminated from the [[United Nations]] resolution after a second vote because many states, including [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]],{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=137}} anticipated that clause to apply unneeded limitations to their right to suppress internal disturbances.{{sfn|van Schaack|1997|p=2267}}{{sfn|Staub|2000|p=368}} Scholarly study of genocide usually acknowledges the UN omission of economic and political groups and uses mass political killing datasets of \"democide\" and \"genocide and politicide\" or \"geno-politicide\".{{sfn|Wayman|Tago|2010|pp=3-4}} Killing by the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]] has been labeled \"genocide\" or \"auto-genocide\" and the deaths under [[Leninism]] and [[Stalinism]] in the Soviet Union and [[Maoism]] in [[China]] have been controversially investigated as possible cases. In particular, the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|Soviet famine in the 1930s]] and the [[Great Chinese Famine|famine in China]] during the [[Great Leap Forward]] have been \"depicted as instances of mass killing underpinned by genocidal intent\".{{efn|name=Williams terms 2008}}\n* [[Politicide]] \u2013 the term \"politicide\" is used to describe the killing of groups that would not otherwise be covered by the Genocide Convention.{{sfn|Harff|Gurr|1988|p=360}} Professor [[Barbara Harff]] studies \"genocide and politicide\", sometimes shortened as \"geno-politicide\", in order to include the killing of political, economic, ethnic and cultural groups.{{efn|name=Wayman terms 2010a}} Professor Manus I. Midlarsky uses the term \"politicide\" to describe an arc of large-scale killing from the western parts of the Soviet Union to China and Cambodia.{{efn|name=Midlarsky terms 2005}} In his book ''The Killing Trap: Genocide in the Twentieth Century'', Midlarsky raises similarities between the killings of Stalin and [[Pol Pot]].{{sfn|Midlarsky|2005|p=321}}\n* [[Holocaust (disambiguation)|Holocaust]] - The term \"communist holocaust\" has been used by some state officials and [[non-governmental organization]]s.{{sfn|US Congress|1993|p=15 at \u00a7905a1}}{{sfn|Rauch|2003}}{{sfn|Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation|2010}} The term \"red Holocaust\" was coined by the ''[[Institute of Contemporary History (Munich)|Munich Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte]]''.{{efn|name=Hackmann terms 2009}}{{sfn|M\u00f6ller|1999}} Professor [[Steven Rosefielde]] used \"Red Holocaust\" for communist \"peacetime state killings\", while stating that it \"could be defined to include all murders (judicially sanctioned terror-executions), criminal manslaughter (lethal forced labor and ethnic cleansing) and felonious negligent homicide (terror-starvation) incurred from insurrectionary actions and civil wars prior to state seizure, and all subsequent felonious state killings.\"{{efn|name=Rosefielde terms 2010}} According to J\u00f6rg Hackmann, this term is not popular among scholars in Germany or internationally.{{efn|name=Hackmann terms 2009}} [[Alexandra Laignel-Lavastine]] writes that usage of this term \"allows the reality it describes to immediately attain, in the Western mind, a status equal to that of the [[Final Solution|extermination of the Jews]] by the [[Nazi regime]]\".{{efn|name=Shafir terms 2016}}{{sfn|Rousso|Goslan|2004|p=157}} Michael Shafir writes that the use of the term supports the \"competitive martyrdom component of Double Genocide\", a theory whose worst version is [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] obfuscation.{{sfn|Shafir|2016|pp=64, 74}} George Voicu states that Leon Volovici has \"rightfully condemned the abusive use of this concept as an attempt to 'usurp' and undermine a symbol specific to the history of [[European Jews]].\"{{efn|name=Voicu terms 2018}}\n* [[Democide]] \u2013 Professor [[R.

He believes the most neutral terms are \"repression\" and \"mass killings\", although in Russian the broad concept of repression is commonly held to include mass killings and is sometimes assumed to be synonymous with it, which is not the case in other languages.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|1996|p=1320}}\n* [[Classicide]] \u2013 Professor [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]] has proposed the term classicide to mean the \"intended mass killing of entire social classes\".{{sfn|Mann|2005|p=17}}{{efn|name=Semelin terms 2009b}} \"Classicide\" is considered \"premeditated mass killing\" narrower than \"genocide\" in that it targets a part of a population defined by its social status, but broader than \"politicide\" in that the group is targeted without regard to their political activity.{{sfn|Sangar|2007|p=1, paragraph 3}}\n* [[Crime against humanity]] \u2013 Professor [[Klas-G\u00f6ran Karlsson]] uses the term \"crimes against humanity\", which includes \"the direct mass killings of politically undesirable elements, as well as forced deportations and forced labour\". He acknowledges that the term may be misleading in the sense that the regimes targeted groups of their own citizens, but considers it useful as a broad legal term which emphasizes attacks on civilian populations and because the offenses demean humanity as a whole.{{sfn|Karlsson|Schoenhals|2008|p=104}} Historian [[Jacques S\u00e9melin]] and Professor [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]]{{sfn|Semelin|2009|p=344}} believe that \"crime against humanity\" is more appropriate than \"genocide\" or \"politicide\" when speaking of violence by communist regimes.{{sfn|Semelin|2009|p=318}}\n\n== Estimates ==\nAccording to [[Klas-G\u00f6ran Karlsson]], discussion of the number of victims of communist regimes has been \"extremely extensive and ideologically biased\".{{sfn|Karlsson|Schoenhals|2008|p=8}} Although any attempt to estimate a total number of killings under communist regimes depends greatly on definitions,{{sfn|Dallin|2000|pp=882\u2012883}} several attempts to compile previously published data have been made:\n* In 1994, [[R. J. Rummel]]'s book ''Death by Government'' included about 110 million people, foreign and domestic, killed by communist [[democide]] from 1900 to 1987.{{sfn|Rummel|1994|p=15, Table 1.6}} In 1993, Rummel wrote: \"Even were we to have total access to all communist archives we still would not be able to calculate precisely how many the communists murdered. Consider that even in spite of the archival statistics and detailed reports of survivors, the best experts still disagree by over 40 percent on the total [[The Holocaust#Victims and death toll|number of Jews killed by the Nazis]]. We cannot expect near this accuracy for the victims of communism. We can, however, get a probable [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)|order of magnitude]] and a relative approximation of these deaths within a most likely range\".{{sfn|Rummel|1993}} Due to additional information about Mao's culpability in the [[Great Chinese Famine]] from [[Mao: The Unknown Story|the work of Jung Chang and Jon Halliday]], in late 2005 Rummel revised upward his total for communist democide between 1900 and 1999 to about 148 million, using their estimate of 38 million famine deaths.{{sfn|Rummel|2005a}}{{sfn|Rummel|2005b}}\n* \n* In 2005, Benjamin Valentino stated that the number of non-combatants killed by communist regimes in the Soviet Union, People's Republic of China and Cambodia alone ranged from a low of 21 million to a high of 70 million.{{efn|name=Valentino estimate 2005}}{{efn|name=Valentino estimate table 2005}} Citing Rummel and others, Valentino stated that the \"highest end of the plausible range of deaths attributed to communist regimes\" was up to 110 million\".{{efn|name=Valentino estimate 2005}}{{efn|name=Valentino estimate notes 2005}}\n* In 2010, [[Steven Rosefielde]]'s book ''Red Holocaust'' said that communism's internal contradictions \"caused to be killed\" approximately 60 million people and perhaps tens of millions more.{{sfn|Rosefielde|2010|pp=1, 7}}\n* In 2011, [[Matthew White (historian)|Matthew White]] published his rough total of 70 million \"people who died under communist regimes from execution, labor camps, famine, ethnic cleansing, and desperate flight in leaky boats\", not counting those killed in wars.{{efn|name=White estimate 2011}}\n* In 2016, the Dissident blog of the [[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]] made an effort to compile updated ranges of estimates and concluded that the overall range \"spans from 42,870,000 to 161,990,000\" killed, with 100 million the most commonly cited figure.{{efn|name=Dissident estimate 2016}}\n* In 2017, Professor [[Stephen Kotkin]] wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that communism killed at least 65 million people between 1917 and 2017: \"Though communism has killed huge numbers of people intentionally, even more of its victims have died from starvation as a result of its cruel projects of social engineering\".{{efn|name=Kotkin estimate 2017}}{{sfn|ChicagoTribune|2017}}\n\nThe criticisms of some of the estimates were mostly focused on three aspects: (i) the estimates were based on sparse and incomplete data when significant errors are inevitable;{{sfn|Harff|1996|p=118}}{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2004|p=98}}{{sfn|Harff|2017|pp=113-114}} (ii) some critics said the figures were skewed to higher possible values;{{sfn|Weiner|2002|p=450}}{{efn|name=Aronson estimate 2003}}{{sfn|Harff|1996|p=118}} and (iii) some critics argued that victims of [[Holodomor]] and other man-made famines created by communist governments should not be counted.{{sfn|Paczkowski|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Harff|1996|p=118}}{{sfn|Kuromiya|2001|p=195}}\n\n== Proposed causes ==\n=== Ideology ===\n\n[[Klas-G\u00f6ran Karlsson]] writes: \"Ideologies are systems of ideas, which cannot commit crimes independently.

Finlay has argued that Marxism legitimates violence without any clear limiting principle because it rejects moral and ethical norms as constructs of the dominant class and \"states that it would be conceivable for revolutionaries to commit atrocious crimes in bringing about a socialist system, with the belief that their crimes will be retroactively absolved by the new system of ethics put in place by the [[Proletariat#Marxist theory|proletariat]]\".{{efn|name=Jahanbegloo Finlay motive 2014}} [[Rustam Singh (poet)|Rustam Singh]] notes that [[Karl Marx]] had alluded to the possibility of peaceful revolution, but after the failed [[Revolutions of 1848]] emphasized the need for violent revolution and \"revolutionary terror\".{{efn|name=Jahanbegloo Singh motive 2014}}\n\nLiterary historian [[George G. Watson]] cited an 1849 article written by [[Friedrich Engels]] called \"The Hungarian Struggle\" and published in Marx's journal ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', stating that the writings of Engels and others show that \"the [[Marxist theory of history]] required and demanded genocide for reasons implicit in its claim that [[Feudalism#Karl Marx|feudalism]], which in advanced nations was already giving place to [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]], must in its turn be superseded by [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. Entire nations would be left behind after a workers' revolution, feudal remnants in a socialist age, and since they could not advance two steps at a time, they would have to be killed. They were racial trash, as Engels called them, and fit only for the dung-heap of history\".{{sfn|Watson|1998|p=77}}{{efn|name=Magyar essay 1849}} Watson's claims have been criticized by Robert Grant for \"dubious\" evidence, arguing that \"what Marx and Engels are calling for is&nbsp;[...] at the very least a kind of [[cultural genocide]]; but it is not obvious, at least from Watson's citations, that actual mass killing, rather than (to use their phraseology) mere 'absorption' or 'assimilation', is in question\".{{sfn|Grant|1999|p=558}} Talking about Engels' 1849 article and citing Watson's book, historian [[Andrzej Walicki]] has said: \"It is difficult to deny that this was an outright call for genocide\".{{sfn|Walicki|1997|p=154}}\n\nAccording to R. J. Rummel, the killings committed by communist regimes can best be explained as the result of the marriage between absolute power and an absolutist ideology, i.e. Marxism.{{sfn|Totten|Jacobs|2002|p=168}} Rummel states that \"communism was like a fanatical religion. It had its revealed text and its chief interpreters. It had its priests and their ritualistic prose with all the answers. It had a heaven, and the proper behavior to reach it. It had its appeal to faith. And it had its crusades against nonbelievers. What made this secular religion so utterly lethal was its seizure of all the state's instruments of force and coercion and their immediate use to destroy or control all independent sources of power, such as the church, the professions, private businesses, schools, and the family.\"{{sfn|Totten|Jacobs|2002|p=169}} He writes that the Marxists saw the construction of their [[utopia]] as \"though a war on poverty, exploitation, imperialism and inequality. And for the greater good, as in a real war, people are killed. And, thus, this war for the communist utopia had its necessary enemy casualties, the clergy, bourgeoisie, capitalists, wreckers, counterrevolutionaries, rightists, tyrants, rich, landlords, and noncombatants that unfortunately got caught in the battle. In a war millions may die, but the cause may be well justified, as in the defeat of Hitler and an utterly racist Nazism. And to many communists, the cause of a communist utopia was such as to justify all the deaths\".{{sfn|Totten|Jacobs|2002|p=168}}\n\nBenjamin Valentino writes that mass killings strategies are chosen by communists to economically dispossess large numbers of people,{{sfn|Valentino|2005|pp=34-37}}{{efn|name=Valentino motive 2005}} arguing as such: \"Social transformations of this speed and magnitude have been associated with mass killing for two primary reasons. First, the massive social dislocations produced by such changes have often led to [[economic collapse]], [[epidemic]]s, and, most important, widespread famines. [...] The second reason that communist regimes bent on the radical transformation of society have been linked to mass killing is that the revolutionary changes they have pursued have clashed inexorably with the fundamental interests of large segments of their populations. Few people have proved willing to accept such far-reaching sacrifices without intense levels of coercion\".{{sfn|Valentino|2005|pp=93-94}} According to [[Jacques S\u00e9melin]], \"communist systems emerging in the twentieth century ended up destroying their own populations, not because they planned to annihilate them as such, but because they aimed to restructure the 'social body' from top to bottom, even if that meant purging it and recarving it to suit their new [[Prometheus|Promethean]] political ''imaginaire''\".{{efn|name=Semelin motive 2009}}\n\nDaniel Chirot and [[Clark McCauley]] write that especially in Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China and Pol Pot's Cambodia a fanatical certainty that socialism could be made to work motivated communist leaders in \"the ruthless [[dehumanization]] of their enemies, who could be suppressed because they were 'objectively' and 'historically' wrong. Furthermore, if events did not work out as they were supposed to, then that was because [[Enemy of the people#Marxist\u2013Leninist states|class enemies]], foreign spies and [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], or worst of all, internal traitors were wrecking the plan. Under no circumstances could it be admitted that the vision itself might be unworkable, because that meant capitulation to the forces of reaction\".{{efn|name=Chirot motive 2010}} Michael Mann writes that [[communist party]] members were \"ideologically driven, believing that in order to create a new socialist society, they must lead in socialist zeal.

Hicks writes that whereas \"in practice every liberal capitalist country has a solid record for being humane, for by and large respecting rights and freedoms, and for making it possible for people to put together fruitful and meaningful lives\", in socialism \"practice has time and again proved itself more brutal than the worst dictatorships prior to the twentieth century. Each socialist regime has collapsed into dictatorship and begun killing people on a huge scale\".{{sfn|Hicks|2009|pp=87-88}}\n\nEric D. Weitz says that the mass killing in communist states is a natural consequence of the failure of the rule of law, seen commonly during periods of social upheaval in the 20th century. For both communist and non-communist mass killings, \"genocides occurred at moments of extreme social crisis, often generated by the very policies of the regimes\".{{sfn|Weitz|2003|pp=251\u2013252}} They are not inevitable, but are political decisions.{{sfn|Weitz|2003|pp=251\u2013252}} Steven Rosefielde writes that communist rulers had to choose between changing course and \"terror-command\" and more often than not chose the latter.{{efn|name=Rosefielde motive 2010}} Michael Mann argues that a lack of institutionalized authority structures meant that a chaotic mix of both centralized control and party factionalism were factors in the killing.{{efn|name=Mann motive 2005}}\n\n=== Other causes ===\nProfessor Matthew Krain states that many scholars have pointed to revolutions and civil wars as providing the opportunity for radical leaders and ideologies to gain power and the preconditions for mass killing by the state.{{efn|name=Krain motives 1997}} Genocide scholar [[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]] states that the [[Russian Civil War]] was very influential on the emergence of leaders like Stalin and accustomed people to \"harshness, cruelty, terror.\"{{efn|name=Jones motive 2010}} [[Martin Malia]] called the \"brutal conditioning\" of the two World Wars important to understanding communist violence, although not its source.{{sfn|Malia|1999|p=xviii}}\n\n[[Russian history|Russian]] and [[world history]] scholar John M. Thompson places personal responsibility directly on [[Joseph Stalin]]. According to him, \"much of what occurred only makes sense if it stemmed in part from the disturbed mentality, pathological cruelty, and extreme paranoia of Stalin himself. Insecure, despite having established a dictatorship over the party and country, hostile and defensive when confronted with criticism of the excesses of collectivization and the sacrifices required by high-tempo industrialization, and deeply suspicious that past, present, and even yet unknown future opponents were plotting against him, Stalin began to act as a person beleaguered.

The literatures on state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism have been plagued by definitional problems. Terms such as state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism can be (and often are) easily confused and therefore need elaboration. The main difference between state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism, for instance, is one of intentionality. The purpose behind policies of state-sponsored mass murder such as genocide or politicide is to eliminate an entire group (Gurr 1986, 67). The purpose behind policies of state terrorism is to \"induce sharp fear and through that agency to effect a desired outcome in a conflict situation\" (Gurr 1986, 46). The former requires mass killings to accomplish its goal. The latter's success is dependent on the persuasiveness of the fear tactics used. Mass killings may not be necessary to accomplish the particular goal.\" ... \"2. Genocides are mass killings in which the victim group is defined by association with a particular communal group. Politicides are mass killings in which \"victim groups are defined primarily in terms of their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups\" (Harff and Gurr 1988, 360). Interestingly, many of the instances coded by Harff and Gurr as \"politicide\" are considered by much of the literature to be instances of state terrorism (e.g., Argentina, Chile, El Salvador) (Lopez 1984, 63). Evidently there is some overlap between state terrorism and some kinds of state-sponsored mass murder.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Valentino terms 2005\n|{{harvnb|Valentino|2005|p=9}}: \"Mass killing and Genocide.

In addition, it is not in keeping with the terms that have long been used by the academic community. Naturally, the work of creating an inventory includes examining the terms used in practice by researchers in their analyses, and it is reasonable to assume that every time, every society and every paradigm has its own terms to refer to the crimes of communist regimes. Nonetheless, it is possible to establish at this early stage that researchers have long used the word terror to describe the crimes of the Soviet communist regime, regardless of the framework of interpretation to which they adhere. Although the extent to which the mass operations and forced deportations of specific ethnic groups ordered by Stalin before and during the Second World War can be defined as genocide is debated, there is agreement among researchers that the term \u2018terror\u2019 is the best reflection of the development of violence in Bolshevik Russia and in the communist Soviet Union under Lenin and Stalin. As a result, terror will be the term most frequently used here in analysing the Soviet communist criminal history. On the other hand, the term terror is seldom used to describe the mass killings in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, which may be because it is less clear that the actual intention and stated motive of the Khmer Rouge was to terrorise people into submission. The term genocide, however, is relatively widely accepted and established in describing the systematic and selective crimes of the communist regime in Cambodia, although the use of this term is not entirely uncontroversial. Therefore, in analysing the criminal history of Cambodia, this term will be used in precise contexts dealing with the killing of a category of people, whereas more neutral terms such as mass killing and massacre are used to refer to the general use of violence. The terminology used in the Chinese criminal history is dealt with in detail as part of the section on China.\" ... \"In the Soviet case, as Klas-G\u00f6ran Karlsson so rightly notes, there is an \u2018established term\u2019 for the crimes of the regime, namely \u2018terror\u2019 \u2013 and this is used almost regardless of the general frameworks of interpretation employed by individual researchers. In the same way, he notes that \u2018the term genocide is established and accepted as a description of the crimes of the Khmer Rouge\u2019. In the case of the People\u2019s Republic of China, however, there are no equivalent terms that are accepted or generally established in the academic community and that can be made use of in a research inventory. Bibliographies and search engines all speak their own clear language: those who carried out research on Maoism in its day made very limited use of words such as terror and genocide, and neither do these terms appear among the key terms that carry implicit clear explanations and are therefore regularly used by current foreign and Chinese historians.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Semelin terms 2009a\n|{{harvnb|Semelin|2009|p=318}}: \"'Classicide', in counterpoint to genocide, has a certain appeal, but it doesn't convey the fact that communist regimes, beyond their intention of destroying 'classes' - a difficult notion to grasp in itself (what exactly is a 'kulak'?) - end up making political suspicion a rule of government: even within the Party (and perhaps even mainly within the Party). The notion of 'fratricide' is probably more appropriate in this regard. That of 'politicide', which Ted Gurr and Barbara Harff suggest, remains the most intelligent, although it implies by contrast that 'genocide' is not 'political', which is debatable. These authors in effect explain that the aim of politicide is to impose total political domination over a group or a government. Its victims are defined by their position in the social hierarchy or their political opposition to the regime or this dominant group. Such an approach applies well to the political violence of communist powers and more particularly to Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchea. The French historian Henri Locard in fact emphasises this, identifying with Gurr and Harff's approach in his work on Cambodia. However, the term 'politicide' has little currency among some researchers because it has no legal validity in international law. That is one reason why Jean-Louis Margolin tends to recognise what happened in Cambodia as 'genocide' because, as he points out, to speak of 'politicide' amounts to considering Pol Pot's crimes as less grave than those of Hitler. Again, the weight of justice interferes in the debate about concepts that, once again, argue strongly in favour of using the word genocide. But those so concerned about the issue of legal sanctions should also take into account another legal concept that is just as powerful, and better established: that of crime against humanity. In fact, legal scholars such as Antoine Garapon and David Boyle believe that the violence perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge is much more appropriately categorised under the heading of crime against humanity, even if genocidal tendencies can be identified, particularly against the Muslim minority. This accusation is just as serious as that of genocide (the latter moreover being sometimes considered as a subcategory of the former) and should thus be subject to equally severe sentences. I quite agree with these legal scholars, believing that the notion of 'crime against humanity' is generally better suited to the violence perpetrated by communist regimes, a viewpoint shared by Michael Mann.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Weiss-Wendt terms 2008\n|{{harvnb|Weiss-Wendt|2008|p=42}}: \"The field of comparative genocide studies has grown beyond recognition over the past two decades, though more quantitatively than qualitatively.

If we are talking numbers, comparative genocide studies are indeed a success. Upon closer examination, however, genocide scholarship is ridden with contradictions. There is barely any other field of study that enjoys so little consensus on defining principles such as definition of genocide, typology, application of a comparative method, and timeframe. Considering that scholars have always put stress on prevention of genocide, comparative genocide studies have been a failure. Paradoxically, nobody has attempted so far to assess the field of comparative genocide studies as a whole. This is one of the reasons why those who define themselves as genocide scholars have not been able to detect the situation of crisis.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Williams terms 2008\n|{{harvnb|Williams|2008}}: \"A vital element of the evolution of genocide studies is the increased attention devoted to the mass killing of groups not primarily defined by ethnic or religious identities. Most vulnerable minorities around the world ''had'' been so defined when Lemkin was crafting his genocide framework, and when UN member states were drafting the Genocide Convention. Such groups continued to be targeted in the post-Second World War period, as in East Pakistan/ Bangladesh in 1971, or Guatemala between 1978 and 1984. But it became increasingly apparent that ''political'' groups were on the receiving end of some of the worst campaigns of mass killing, such as the devastating assault on the Indonesian Communist Party in 1965\u20141966 (with half a million to one million killed), and the brutal campaigns by Latin American and Asian military regimes against perceived dissidents in the 1970s and 1980s. \nOne result of this re-evaluation was that the mass killing by the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1978, previously ruled out as genocide or designated an 'auto-genocide' because most victims belonged to the same ethnic-Khmer group as their killers, came to be accepted as a classic instance of twentieth-century genocide. Detailed investigations were also launched into the hecatombs of casualties inflicted under Leninism and Stalinism in the post-revolutionary Soviet Union, and by Mao Zedong's communists in China. In both of these cases\u2014and to some degree in Cambodia as well\u2014the majority of deaths resulted not from direct execution, but from the infliction of 'conditions of life calculated to bring about [the] physical destruction' of a group, in the language of Article II(c) of the Genocide Convention.

Rummel (1994, 1995) has a very similar concept, 'democide', which includes such genocide and geno-politicide done by the government forces, plus other killing by government forces, such as random killing not targeted at a particular group. As Rummel (1995: 3-4) says, 'Cold-blooded government killing ... extends beyond genocide'; For example, 'shooting political opponents; or murdering by quota'. Hence, 'to cover all such murder as well as genocide and politicide, I use the concept democide. This is the intentional killing of people by government' (Rummel, 1995: 4).

Although genocide can be understood to be a species of politicide (but not the converse), in practice, genocidal (i.e., ethnoreligious) killings tap into much deeper historical roots of the human condition. In this distinction, I follow Harff and Gurr 1988, 360.\" ... \"Turning to Cambodia, the mass killings in that country during Pol Pot's murderous regime are often characterized with other seemingly identical circumstances. Cambodia and Rwanda, for example, are typically treated as genocides that differ little from each other in essential characteristics. However, the victimization rates for the two countries are similar only when treated as proportions of the ''total'' country population systematically murdered. Although the mass murders in Cambodia are frequently characterized as genocide, I argue that in fact genocidal activity was only a small proportion of the killing and that the vast majority of Cambodians died in a politicide, substantially different in origin from the genocides we have been examining. The matter of etiology lies at the root of my distinction here, not definitional semantics. If we lump the Cambodian case other instances of systematized mass murder, then the sources of all of them become hopelessly muddled.\" ... \"Essentially, I argue that genocides stem from a primitive identification of the \"collective enemy\" in Carl Schmitt's sense, whereas politicides, at least of the Cambodian variety, are attributable to more detailed ideological considerations. Further, the Cambodian case falls under the rubric of state killings, having a particular affinity with earlier practices in the Soviet Union and China. Indeed, an arc of Communist politicide can be traced from the western portions of the Soviet Union to China and on to Cambodia. Not all Communist states participated in extensive politicide, but the particular circumstances of Cambodia in 1975 lent themselves to the commission of systematic mass murder. Because an element of Cambodian state insecurity existed in this period, especially vis-\u00e0-vis Vietnam, a genocidal element is found in the killing of non-Khmer peoples such as the Vietnamese, who comprised a small proportion of the total.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Hackmann terms 2009\n|{{harvnb|Hackmann|2009}}: \"A coining of communism as \u201cred Holocaust,\u201d as had been suggested by the Munich Institut fur Zeitgeschichte, did not find much ground, neither in Germany nor elsewhere in international discussions.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Rosefielde terms 2010\n|{{harvnb|Rosefielde|2010|p=3}}: \"The Red Holocaust could be defined to include all murders (judicially sanctioned terror-executions), criminal manslaughter (lethal forced labor and ethnic cleansing) and felonious negligent homicide (terror-starvation) incurred from insurrectionary actions and civil wars prior to state seizure, and all subsequent felonious state killings.

It also excludes deaths attributable to wartime hostilities after states were founded. As a matter of accounting, the convention excludes Soviet killings before 1929, during World War II (1940-45) and in Germany, occupied Europe, North Korea, Manchuria and the Kuril Islands (1946-53). Killings in China before October 1949 are similarly excluded, as are those in Indochina before 1954. Soviet slaughter of nobles, kulaks, capitalist and the bourgeoisie during War Communism are part of the excluded wartime group, but killings of similar social categories in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia after their civil wars in the process of Communist consolidation are included.

Leon Volovici rightfully condemned the abusive use of this concept as an attempt to \"usurp\" and undermine a symbol specific to the history of European Jews. As many of those who use the term \"red Holocaust\" (and other terms along the same lines, such as \"the Holocaust of Romanian culture\" and \"the Holocaust of Romanian people\") do so with antisemitic rancor, claiming that the authors of this \"Holocaust\" are none other than the Jews, the reason for the hijacking of the term becomes clear: to place the blame on Jews and to manufacture an alternate history.\nIt should be noted that the intelligentsia at the top of Romanian culture does not use the expression \"red Holocaust\" systematically, but rather accidentally.

The 'massive number' he selects as the threshold to mass killing is 'at least fifty thousand intentional deaths over the course of five or fewer years' (Valentino, 2004: 11-12), which of course averages to at least 10,000 killed per year.\" ... \" One reason for selecting these thresholds of 10,000 and 1,000 deaths per year is that we find that in the Harff data on geno-politicide, which are one of our key datasets, there are many cases of over 10,000 killed per year, but also some in which between 1,000 and 10,000 are killed per year. Therefore, analyzing at a 1,000-death threshold (as well as the 10,000 threshold) insures the inclusion of all the Harff cases.

Finlay (''ibid.'' p. 378) argues that this is done by 'undermining existing moral norms and suggesting that new ones will be created to suit a new proletarian order.' Marx argues that norms and ethics are determined by the dominating class of the time, as can be illustrated in Lenin's statement that 'Honesty is a bourgeoisie virtue', meaning that honesty is crucial to the existence of bourgeoisie, as other virtues such as loyalty and obedience were necessary virtues during the reign of the feudal aristocracy. This impacts the concept of justice in war dramatically.\nAs there is the assumption that a new social order is to be created, along with a new set of moral and ethical codes, then the current ones may be discarded. Therefore, Finley (''ibid.'') states that it would be conceivable for revolutionaries to commit atrocious crimes in bringing about a socialist system, with the belief that their crimes will be retroactively absolved by the new system of ethics put in place by the proletariat. Finley also addresses an alternative opinion, that of Shlomo Avineri, who believes that this may be a non-issue when one takes into account the universality of the proletariat. This universality means that it has no active class-based or sectarian interest, or, rather, that its interests represent those of all society. Its major interest is simply to 'eliminate all other special interests on the basis of which it suffers oppression' and is an entirely negative entirely (''ibid.'', p. 379). Therefore, our conception of ethics and morality - the product of a capitalist society - is inaccurate. Being based on the interest of the bourgeoisie rather than a true and authentic reflection of the ethics of a universal class, its contravention is not something to be lamented. Finley understands Avineri as drawing two conclusions. First, that: \n:whatever the bourgeoisie with its individualistic and legalistic conception of political ethics and legality has to say about the morality of violence is likely to be invalid since it reflects the particular class interests and therefore the perverted humanism of its proponents. (''Ibid.'', p. 370)\nand, moreover, that only ethical claims of the proletariat are valid, insofar as they are the true reflections of 'the perspective of the last social class, at its final revolutionary stage of oppression' (''ibid.''). It is only then that morals and ethics can be created authentically, and all other systems ought to be considered as arbitrary. However, this creates a major difficulty for Finlay and, as Marx has inspired many other theorists (\u017di\u017eek, Fanon, Sorel, etc.) this is a difficulty which he identifies in each of their works as well.\nUnderstanding that revolutionary violence is carried out in the hope of future absolution based on a hypothetical social order able to craft a universal system of ethics, Finlay sees this as ''carte blanche'' for revolutionists to carry out any action, however atrocious, so long as it helps bring about this imminent revolution. Finlay's 'permissive doctrine' is a 'philosophical framework within which the possibility of using violence is validated but without setting any clear limits to how much violence can be used and against whom'. Finlay also argue that there is a tendency for excess, as Fanon, Sorel and \u017di\u017eek all see the use of violence as beneficial, since it may act as a spark for the revolution. Finlay sees the total legitimation of violence in revolution, with no principle of restriction, to be both dangerous and unethical.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Jahanbegloo Singh motive 2014\n|{{harvnb|Jahanbegloo|2014|pp=120-121}}: \"Singh makes a principled argument: that Marx saw the use of violence, even when it is avoidable, as required insofar as that it has a purging quality, believing that only by using violence can all elements of the previous regime be eradicated. Moreover, Singh (''ibid.'', p. 14) considers Marx's references to the use of bourgeoisie democratic institutions to bring about social change only as 'hinting to the possibility of the working class coming into power, in England, through universal suffrage'. Furthermore, he quotes Engels in a letter addressed to the Communist Committee in Brussels in October 1846. In this letter, Engels states that there cannot be any means of carrying out the communist agenda 'other than a democratic revolution by force' (''ibid.'' p. 10). Singh, however, does acknowledge the desire in Marx to avoid a bloody revolution.\nSingh (''ibid.'' p. 11) notes that most Marxist writing that alluded to the possibility of this transition being carried out peacefully took place before the events of 1844-48, which 'showed that a peaceful change was not even remotely possible'. After 1848, Singh notes a return to advocating a violent revolution due to what Singh identifies as the 'practical considerations' of being unable to overcome the existing obstacles to a peaceful transition. Singh (''ibid.'' p. 13) writes that, in 1848, Marx published an article titled ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/06.htm The Victory of Counter-Revolution in Vienna]'', where he states 'there is only one means by which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated - and that is by revolutionary terror'.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Magyar essay 1849\n|[https://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/marx/works/1849/01/13.htm ''The Magyar Struggle'']: \"Among all the large and small nations of Austria, only three standard-bearers of progress took an active part in history, and still retain their vitality \u2014 the Germans, the Poles and the Magyars.

For that reason they are now counter-revolutionary.\" ... \"There is no country in Europe which does not have in some corner or other one or several ruined fragments of peoples, the remnant of a former population that was suppressed and held in bondage by the nation which later became the main vehicle of historical development. These relics of a nation mercilessly trampled under foot in the course of history, as Hegel says, these residual fragments of peoples always become fanatical standard-bearers of counter-revolution and remain so until their complete extirpation or loss of their national character, just as their whole existence in general is itself a protest against a great historical revolution. Such, in Scotland, are the Gaels, the supporters of the Stuarts from 1640 to 1745. Such, in France, are the Bretons, the supporters of the Bourbons from 1792 to 1800.

But at the first victorious uprising of the French proletariat, which Louis Napoleon is striving with all his might to conjure up, the Austrian Germans and Magyars will be set free and wreak a bloody revenge on the Slav barbarians. The general war which will then break out will smash this Slav Sonderbund and wipe out all these petty hidebound nations, down to their very names.

Dread of political and economic pollution by the survival of antagonistic classes has been for the most extreme communist leaders what fear of racial pollution was for Hitler. There, also, material explanations fail to address the extent of the killings, gruesome tortures, fantastic trails, and attempts to wipe out whole categories of people that occurred in Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China, and Pol Pot's Cambodia. The revolutionary thinkers who formed and led communist regimes were not just ordinary intellectuals. They had to be fanatics in the true sense of that word. They were so certain of their ideas that no evidence to the contrary could change their minds. Those who came to doubt the rightness of their ways were eliminated, or never achieved power. The element of religious certitude found in prophetic movements was as important as their Marxist science in sustaining the notion that their vision of socialism could be made to work. This justified the ruthless dehumanization of their enemies, who could be suppressed because they were 'objectively' and 'historically' wrong. Furthermore, if events did not work out as they were supposed to, then that was because class enemies, foreign spies and saboteurs, or worst of all, internal traitors were wrecking the plan. Under no circumstances could it be admitted that the vision itself might be unworkable, because that meant capitulation to the forces of reaction. The logic of the situation in times of crisis then demanded that these 'bad elements' (as they were called in Maoist China) be killed, deported, or relegated to a permanently inferior status. That is very close to saying that the community of God, or the racially pure volksgemeinschaft could only be guaranteed if the corrupting elements within it were eliminated (Courtois et al. 1999).\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Mann motive 2005\n|{{harvnb|Mann|2005|pp=318, 321}}: \"All accounts of 20th-century mass murder include the Communist regimes.

These saw themselves as belonging to a single socialist family, and all referred to a Marxist tradition of development theory. They murderously cleansed in similar ways, though to different degrees. Later regimes consciously adapted their practices to the perceived successes and failures of earlier ones. The Khmer Rouge used China and the Soviet Union (and Vietnam and North Korea) as reference societies, while China used the Soviet Union. All addressed the same basic problem - how to apply a revolutionary vision of a future industrial society to a present agrarian one. These two dimensions, of time and agrarian backwardness, help account for many of the differences.\" ... \"Ordinary party members were also ideologically driven, believing that in order to create a new socialist society, they must lead in socialist zeal.

The ideological conviction of leaders promoting such a political scheme is thus decisive. Nevertheless, it would be far too simplistic an interpretation to assume that the sole purpose of inflicting these various forms of violence on civilians could only aim at instilling a climate of terror in this 'new society'. In fact, they are part of a broader whole, i.e. the spectrum of social engineering techniques implememted in order to transform a society completely. There can be no doubt that it is this utopia of a classless society which drives that kind of revolutionary project. The plan for political and social reshaping will thus logically claim victims in all strata of society. And through this process, communist systems emerging in the twentieth century ended up destroying their own populations, not because they planned to annihilate them as such, but because they aimed to restructure the 'social body' from top to bottom, even if that meant purging it and recarving it to suit their new Promethean political imaginaire.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Rosefielde motive 2010\n|{{harvnb|Rosefielde|2010|p=xvi}}: \"The story that emerges from the exercise is edifying.

Terror-command was chosen among other reasons because of legitimate fears about the long-term viability of terror-free command, and the ideological risks of market communism. The internal contradictions of communism confronted leaders with a predicament that could only have been efficiently resolved by acknowledging communism's inferiority and changing course. Denial offered two unhappy options: one bloody, the other dreary, and history records that more often than not, communist rulers chose the worst option. Tens of millions were killed in vain; a testament to the triumph of ruthless hope over dispassionate reason that proved more durable than Hitler's and Hirohito's racism.

Free-fire zones were established in depopulated areas, permitting Soviet troops to shoot anything that moved. In addition to killing tens of thousands in attacks on villages, this policy eventually produced one of the most massive refugee movements in modern history. Approximately 5 million people out of a total prewar population of between 15.5 and 17 million had fled the country by the early 1990s, the great majority across the border to Pakistan.

Such arguments in no way detract from the unique nature of Auschwitz - the mobilization of leading-edge technological resources and their use in an \"industrial process\" involving the construction of an \"extermination factory,\" the use of gas, and cremation. However, this argument highlights one particular feature of many Communist regimes - their systematic use of famine as a weapon. The regime aimed to control the total available food supply and, with immense ingenuity, to distribute food purely on the basis of \"merits\" and \"demerits\" earned by individuals. This policy was a recipe for creating famine on a massive scale. Remember that in the period after 1918, only Communist countries experienced such famines, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions, of people. And again in the 1980s, two African countries that claimed to be Marxist-Leninist, Ethiopia and Mozambique, were the only such countries to suffer these deadly famines.\"\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexandra|first=Goujon|title=Kurapaty (1937-1941): NKVD Mass Killings in Soviet Belarus|url=http://bo-k2s.sciences-po.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/kurapaty-1937-1941-nkvd-mass-killings-soviet-belarus|date=March 27, 2008|journal=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence|accessdate=April 25, 2020|issn=1961-9898}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|title=The Gulag's Veiled Mortality|url=https://www.hoover.org/news/gulags-veiled-mortality-golfo-alexopoulos|date=January 7, 2013|publisher=Hoover Institution|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|title=Illness and Inhumanity in Stalin's Gulag|date=April 25, 2017|publisher=Yale University|isbn=978-0-300-17941-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KSSMDgAAQBAJ|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}\n* {{citation|last=Allen|first=Paul|title=Katyn: Stalin's Massacre and the Seeds of Polish Resurrection|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55750-670-2}}\n* {{citation|last=Amstutz|first=Mark R.|title=International ethics: concepts, theories, and cases in global politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qTYko_PygLYC&pg=PA96&dq=mass+killing+communism#v=onepage|edition=2nd|date=January 28, 2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3583-1}}\n* {{citation|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher|last2=Mitrokhin|first2=Vasili|title=The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00313-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4eSR1rHg5_YC&pg=PA457&dq=half+a+million+Red+Terror+of+1977+and+1978}}\n* {{citation|last=Andjelic|first=Neven|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina: The End of a Legacy|publisher=Frank Cass|year=2003|page=36|isbn=0-7146-5485-X}}\n* {{citation|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|title=The Worst of the Madness|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=November 11, 2010|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/11/worst-madness/?pagination=false}}\n* {{citation|last=Aronson|first=Ronald|title=Review: Communism's Posthumous Trial.

Terms used to define these killings include \"mass killing\", \"[[democide]]\", \"[[politicide]]\", \"[[classicide]]\" and a broad definition of \"[[genocide]]\".\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{see also|Genocide definitions}}\nSeveral different terms are used to describe the intentional killing of large numbers of noncombatants{{sfn|Wheatcroft|1996|pp=1320-1321}}{{efn|name=Krain terms 1997}}{{efn|name=Valentino terms 2005}}{{efn|name=Karlsson terms 2008}}{{efn|name=Semelin terms 2009a}} and according to Professor Anton Weiss-Wendt there is no consensus in the field of comparative genocide studies on a definition of \"genocide\".{{efn|name=Weiss-Wendt terms 2008}} The following terminology has been used by individual authors to describe mass killings of unarmed civilians by [[communist state|communist governments]], individually or as a whole:\n* [[Genocide]] \u2013 under the [[Genocide Convention]], the [[Genocide#Genocide as a crime|crime of genocide]] generally applies to mass murder of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] rather than political or social groups.

It had its revealed text and its chief interpreters. It had its priests and their ritualistic prose with all the answers. It had a heaven, and the proper behavior to reach it. It had its appeal to faith. And it had its crusades against nonbelievers. What made this secular religion so utterly lethal was its seizure of all the state's instruments of force and coercion and their immediate use to destroy or control all independent sources of power, such as the church, the professions, private businesses, schools, and the family.\"{{sfn|Totten|Jacobs|2002|p=169}} He writes that the Marxists saw the construction of their [[utopia]] as \"though a war on poverty, exploitation, imperialism and inequality. And for the greater good, as in a real war, people are killed. And, thus, this war for the communist utopia had its necessary enemy casualties, the clergy, bourgeoisie, capitalists, wreckers, counterrevolutionaries, rightists, tyrants, rich, landlords, and noncombatants that unfortunately got caught in the battle. In a war millions may die, but the cause may be well justified, as in the defeat of Hitler and an utterly racist Nazism. And to many communists, the cause of a communist utopia was such as to justify all the deaths\".{{sfn|Totten|Jacobs|2002|p=168}}\n\nBenjamin Valentino writes that mass killings strategies are chosen by communists to economically dispossess large numbers of people,{{sfn|Valentino|2005|pp=34-37}}{{efn|name=Valentino motive 2005}} arguing as such: \"Social transformations of this speed and magnitude have been associated with mass killing for two primary reasons. First, the massive social dislocations produced by such changes have often led to [[economic collapse]], [[epidemic]]s, and, most important, widespread famines. [...] The second reason that communist regimes bent on the radical transformation of society have been linked to mass killing is that the revolutionary changes they have pursued have clashed inexorably with the fundamental interests of large segments of their populations. Few people have proved willing to accept such far-reaching sacrifices without intense levels of coercion\".{{sfn|Valentino|2005|pp=93-94}} According to [[Jacques S\u00e9melin]], \"communist systems emerging in the twentieth century ended up destroying their own populations, not because they planned to annihilate them as such, but because they aimed to restructure the 'social body' from top to bottom, even if that meant purging it and recarving it to suit their new [[Prometheus|Promethean]] political ''imaginaire''\".{{efn|name=Semelin motive 2009}}\n\nDaniel Chirot and [[Clark McCauley]] write that especially in Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China and Pol Pot's Cambodia a fanatical certainty that socialism could be made to work motivated communist leaders in \"the ruthless [[dehumanization]] of their enemies, who could be suppressed because they were 'objectively' and 'historically' wrong. Furthermore, if events did not work out as they were supposed to, then that was because [[Enemy of the people#Marxist\u2013Leninist states|class enemies]], foreign spies and [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], or worst of all, internal traitors were wrecking the plan.

The literatures on state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism have been plagued by definitional problems. Terms such as state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism can be (and often are) easily confused and therefore need elaboration. The main difference between state-sponsored mass murder and state terrorism, for instance, is one of intentionality. The purpose behind policies of state-sponsored mass murder such as genocide or politicide is to eliminate an entire group (Gurr 1986, 67). The purpose behind policies of state terrorism is to \"induce sharp fear and through that agency to effect a desired outcome in a conflict situation\" (Gurr 1986, 46). The former requires mass killings to accomplish its goal. The latter's success is dependent on the persuasiveness of the fear tactics used. Mass killings may not be necessary to accomplish the particular goal.\" ... \"2. Genocides are mass killings in which the victim group is defined by association with a particular communal group. Politicides are mass killings in which \"victim groups are defined primarily in terms of their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups\" (Harff and Gurr 1988, 360). Interestingly, many of the instances coded by Harff and Gurr as \"politicide\" are considered by much of the literature to be instances of state terrorism (e.g., Argentina, Chile, El Salvador) (Lopez 1984, 63). Evidently there is some overlap between state terrorism and some kinds of state-sponsored mass murder.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Valentino terms 2005\n|{{harvnb|Valentino|2005|p=9}}: \"Mass killing and Genocide.

In addition, it is not in keeping with the terms that have long been used by the academic community. Naturally, the work of creating an inventory includes examining the terms used in practice by researchers in their analyses, and it is reasonable to assume that every time, every society and every paradigm has its own terms to refer to the crimes of communist regimes. Nonetheless, it is possible to establish at this early stage that researchers have long used the word terror to describe the crimes of the Soviet communist regime, regardless of the framework of interpretation to which they adhere. Although the extent to which the mass operations and forced deportations of specific ethnic groups ordered by Stalin before and during the Second World War can be defined as genocide is debated, there is agreement among researchers that the term \u2018terror\u2019 is the best reflection of the development of violence in Bolshevik Russia and in the communist Soviet Union under Lenin and Stalin. As a result, terror will be the term most frequently used here in analysing the Soviet communist criminal history. On the other hand, the term terror is seldom used to describe the mass killings in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, which may be because it is less clear that the actual intention and stated motive of the Khmer Rouge was to terrorise people into submission. The term genocide, however, is relatively widely accepted and established in describing the systematic and selective crimes of the communist regime in Cambodia, although the use of this term is not entirely uncontroversial. Therefore, in analysing the criminal history of Cambodia, this term will be used in precise contexts dealing with the killing of a category of people, whereas more neutral terms such as mass killing and massacre are used to refer to the general use of violence. The terminology used in the Chinese criminal history is dealt with in detail as part of the section on China.\" ... \"In the Soviet case, as Klas-G\u00f6ran Karlsson so rightly notes, there is an \u2018established term\u2019 for the crimes of the regime, namely \u2018terror\u2019 \u2013 and this is used almost regardless of the general frameworks of interpretation employed by individual researchers. In the same way, he notes that \u2018the term genocide is established and accepted as a description of the crimes of the Khmer Rouge\u2019. In the case of the People\u2019s Republic of China, however, there are no equivalent terms that are accepted or generally established in the academic community and that can be made use of in a research inventory. Bibliographies and search engines all speak their own clear language: those who carried out research on Maoism in its day made very limited use of words such as terror and genocide, and neither do these terms appear among the key terms that carry implicit clear explanations and are therefore regularly used by current foreign and Chinese historians.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Semelin terms 2009a\n|{{harvnb|Semelin|2009|p=318}}: \"'Classicide', in counterpoint to genocide, has a certain appeal, but it doesn't convey the fact that communist regimes, beyond their intention of destroying 'classes' - a difficult notion to grasp in itself (what exactly is a 'kulak'?) - end up making political suspicion a rule of government: even within the Party (and perhaps even mainly within the Party). The notion of 'fratricide' is probably more appropriate in this regard. That of 'politicide', which Ted Gurr and Barbara Harff suggest, remains the most intelligent, although it implies by contrast that 'genocide' is not 'political', which is debatable. These authors in effect explain that the aim of politicide is to impose total political domination over a group or a government. Its victims are defined by their position in the social hierarchy or their political opposition to the regime or this dominant group. Such an approach applies well to the political violence of communist powers and more particularly to Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchea. The French historian Henri Locard in fact emphasises this, identifying with Gurr and Harff's approach in his work on Cambodia. However, the term 'politicide' has little currency among some researchers because it has no legal validity in international law. That is one reason why Jean-Louis Margolin tends to recognise what happened in Cambodia as 'genocide' because, as he points out, to speak of 'politicide' amounts to considering Pol Pot's crimes as less grave than those of Hitler. Again, the weight of justice interferes in the debate about concepts that, once again, argue strongly in favour of using the word genocide. But those so concerned about the issue of legal sanctions should also take into account another legal concept that is just as powerful, and better established: that of crime against humanity. In fact, legal scholars such as Antoine Garapon and David Boyle believe that the violence perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge is much more appropriately categorised under the heading of crime against humanity, even if genocidal tendencies can be identified, particularly against the Muslim minority. This accusation is just as serious as that of genocide (the latter moreover being sometimes considered as a subcategory of the former) and should thus be subject to equally severe sentences. I quite agree with these legal scholars, believing that the notion of 'crime against humanity' is generally better suited to the violence perpetrated by communist regimes, a viewpoint shared by Michael Mann.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Weiss-Wendt terms 2008\n|{{harvnb|Weiss-Wendt|2008|p=42}}: \"The field of comparative genocide studies has grown beyond recognition over the past two decades, though more quantitatively than qualitatively.

If we are talking numbers, comparative genocide studies are indeed a success. Upon closer examination, however, genocide scholarship is ridden with contradictions. There is barely any other field of study that enjoys so little consensus on defining principles such as definition of genocide, typology, application of a comparative method, and timeframe. Considering that scholars have always put stress on prevention of genocide, comparative genocide studies have been a failure. Paradoxically, nobody has attempted so far to assess the field of comparative genocide studies as a whole. This is one of the reasons why those who define themselves as genocide scholars have not been able to detect the situation of crisis.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Williams terms 2008\n|{{harvnb|Williams|2008}}: \"A vital element of the evolution of genocide studies is the increased attention devoted to the mass killing of groups not primarily defined by ethnic or religious identities. Most vulnerable minorities around the world ''had'' been so defined when Lemkin was crafting his genocide framework, and when UN member states were drafting the Genocide Convention. Such groups continued to be targeted in the post-Second World War period, as in East Pakistan/ Bangladesh in 1971, or Guatemala between 1978 and 1984. But it became increasingly apparent that ''political'' groups were on the receiving end of some of the worst campaigns of mass killing, such as the devastating assault on the Indonesian Communist Party in 1965\u20141966 (with half a million to one million killed), and the brutal campaigns by Latin American and Asian military regimes against perceived dissidents in the 1970s and 1980s. \nOne result of this re-evaluation was that the mass killing by the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1978, previously ruled out as genocide or designated an 'auto-genocide' because most victims belonged to the same ethnic-Khmer group as their killers, came to be accepted as a classic instance of twentieth-century genocide. Detailed investigations were also launched into the hecatombs of casualties inflicted under Leninism and Stalinism in the post-revolutionary Soviet Union, and by Mao Zedong's communists in China. In both of these cases\u2014and to some degree in Cambodia as well\u2014the majority of deaths resulted not from direct execution, but from the infliction of 'conditions of life calculated to bring about [the] physical destruction' of a group, in the language of Article II(c) of the Genocide Convention. In particular, the devastating famines that struck the Ukraine and other minority regions of the USSR in the early 1930s, and the even greater death-toll\u2014numbering tens of millions\u2014caused by famine during Mao's 'Great Leap Forward' (1958\u20141962), were increasingly, though not uncontroversially, depicted as instances of mass killing underpinned by genocidal intent.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Wayman terms 2010a\n|{{harvnb|Wayman|Tago|2010|p=4}}: \"The two important scholars who have created datasets related to this are Rummel (1995) and Harff (2003).

Rummel (1994, 1995) has a very similar concept, 'democide', which includes such genocide and geno-politicide done by the government forces, plus other killing by government forces, such as random killing not targeted at a particular group. As Rummel (1995: 3-4) says, 'Cold-blooded government killing ... extends beyond genocide'; For example, 'shooting political opponents; or murdering by quota'. Hence, 'to cover all such murder as well as genocide and politicide, I use the concept democide. This is the intentional killing of people by government' (Rummel, 1995: 4).

Although genocide can be understood to be a species of politicide (but not the converse), in practice, genocidal (i.e., ethnoreligious) killings tap into much deeper historical roots of the human condition. In this distinction, I follow Harff and Gurr 1988, 360.\" ... \"Turning to Cambodia, the mass killings in that country during Pol Pot's murderous regime are often characterized with other seemingly identical circumstances. Cambodia and Rwanda, for example, are typically treated as genocides that differ little from each other in essential characteristics. However, the victimization rates for the two countries are similar only when treated as proportions of the ''total'' country population systematically murdered. Although the mass murders in Cambodia are frequently characterized as genocide, I argue that in fact genocidal activity was only a small proportion of the killing and that the vast majority of Cambodians died in a politicide, substantially different in origin from the genocides we have been examining. The matter of etiology lies at the root of my distinction here, not definitional semantics. If we lump the Cambodian case other instances of systematized mass murder, then the sources of all of them become hopelessly muddled.\" ... \"Essentially, I argue that genocides stem from a primitive identification of the \"collective enemy\" in Carl Schmitt's sense, whereas politicides, at least of the Cambodian variety, are attributable to more detailed ideological considerations. Further, the Cambodian case falls under the rubric of state killings, having a particular affinity with earlier practices in the Soviet Union and China. Indeed, an arc of Communist politicide can be traced from the western portions of the Soviet Union to China and on to Cambodia. Not all Communist states participated in extensive politicide, but the particular circumstances of Cambodia in 1975 lent themselves to the commission of systematic mass murder. Because an element of Cambodian state insecurity existed in this period, especially vis-\u00e0-vis Vietnam, a genocidal element is found in the killing of non-Khmer peoples such as the Vietnamese, who comprised a small proportion of the total.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Hackmann terms 2009\n|{{harvnb|Hackmann|2009}}: \"A coining of communism as \u201cred Holocaust,\u201d as had been suggested by the Munich Institut fur Zeitgeschichte, did not find much ground, neither in Germany nor elsewhere in international discussions.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Rosefielde terms 2010\n|{{harvnb|Rosefielde|2010|p=3}}: \"The Red Holocaust could be defined to include all murders (judicially sanctioned terror-executions), criminal manslaughter (lethal forced labor and ethnic cleansing) and felonious negligent homicide (terror-starvation) incurred from insurrectionary actions and civil wars prior to state seizure, and all subsequent felonious state killings.

It also excludes deaths attributable to wartime hostilities after states were founded. As a matter of accounting, the convention excludes Soviet killings before 1929, during World War II (1940-45) and in Germany, occupied Europe, North Korea, Manchuria and the Kuril Islands (1946-53). Killings in China before October 1949 are similarly excluded, as are those in Indochina before 1954. Soviet slaughter of nobles, kulaks, capitalist and the bourgeoisie during War Communism are part of the excluded wartime group, but killings of similar social categories in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia after their civil wars in the process of Communist consolidation are included.

Leon Volovici rightfully condemned the abusive use of this concept as an attempt to \"usurp\" and undermine a symbol specific to the history of European Jews. As many of those who use the term \"red Holocaust\" (and other terms along the same lines, such as \"the Holocaust of Romanian culture\" and \"the Holocaust of Romanian people\") do so with antisemitic rancor, claiming that the authors of this \"Holocaust\" are none other than the Jews, the reason for the hijacking of the term becomes clear: to place the blame on Jews and to manufacture an alternate history.\nIt should be noted that the intelligentsia at the top of Romanian culture does not use the expression \"red Holocaust\" systematically, but rather accidentally.

The 'massive number' he selects as the threshold to mass killing is 'at least fifty thousand intentional deaths over the course of five or fewer years' (Valentino, 2004: 11-12), which of course averages to at least 10,000 killed per year.\" ... \" One reason for selecting these thresholds of 10,000 and 1,000 deaths per year is that we find that in the Harff data on geno-politicide, which are one of our key datasets, there are many cases of over 10,000 killed per year, but also some in which between 1,000 and 10,000 are killed per year.

Finlay (''ibid.'' p. 378) argues that this is done by 'undermining existing moral norms and suggesting that new ones will be created to suit a new proletarian order.' Marx argues that norms and ethics are determined by the dominating class of the time, as can be illustrated in Lenin's statement that 'Honesty is a bourgeoisie virtue', meaning that honesty is crucial to the existence of bourgeoisie, as other virtues such as loyalty and obedience were necessary virtues during the reign of the feudal aristocracy. This impacts the concept of justice in war dramatically.\nAs there is the assumption that a new social order is to be created, along with a new set of moral and ethical codes, then the current ones may be discarded. Therefore, Finley (''ibid.'') states that it would be conceivable for revolutionaries to commit atrocious crimes in bringing about a socialist system, with the belief that their crimes will be retroactively absolved by the new system of ethics put in place by the proletariat. Finley also addresses an alternative opinion, that of Shlomo Avineri, who believes that this may be a non-issue when one takes into account the universality of the proletariat. This universality means that it has no active class-based or sectarian interest, or, rather, that its interests represent those of all society. Its major interest is simply to 'eliminate all other special interests on the basis of which it suffers oppression' and is an entirely negative entirely (''ibid.'', p. 379). Therefore, our conception of ethics and morality - the product of a capitalist society - is inaccurate. Being based on the interest of the bourgeoisie rather than a true and authentic reflection of the ethics of a universal class, its contravention is not something to be lamented. Finley understands Avineri as drawing two conclusions. First, that: \n:whatever the bourgeoisie with its individualistic and legalistic conception of political ethics and legality has to say about the morality of violence is likely to be invalid since it reflects the particular class interests and therefore the perverted humanism of its proponents. (''Ibid.'', p. 370)\nand, moreover, that only ethical claims of the proletariat are valid, insofar as they are the true reflections of 'the perspective of the last social class, at its final revolutionary stage of oppression' (''ibid.''). It is only then that morals and ethics can be created authentically, and all other systems ought to be considered as arbitrary. However, this creates a major difficulty for Finlay and, as Marx has inspired many other theorists (\u017di\u017eek, Fanon, Sorel, etc.) this is a difficulty which he identifies in each of their works as well.\nUnderstanding that revolutionary violence is carried out in the hope of future absolution based on a hypothetical social order able to craft a universal system of ethics, Finlay sees this as ''carte blanche'' for revolutionists to carry out any action, however atrocious, so long as it helps bring about this imminent revolution. Finlay's 'permissive doctrine' is a 'philosophical framework within which the possibility of using violence is validated but without setting any clear limits to how much violence can be used and against whom'. Finlay also argue that there is a tendency for excess, as Fanon, Sorel and \u017di\u017eek all see the use of violence as beneficial, since it may act as a spark for the revolution. Finlay sees the total legitimation of violence in revolution, with no principle of restriction, to be both dangerous and unethical.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Jahanbegloo Singh motive 2014\n|{{harvnb|Jahanbegloo|2014|pp=120-121}}: \"Singh makes a principled argument: that Marx saw the use of violence, even when it is avoidable, as required insofar as that it has a purging quality, believing that only by using violence can all elements of the previous regime be eradicated. Moreover, Singh (''ibid.'', p. 14) considers Marx's references to the use of bourgeoisie democratic institutions to bring about social change only as 'hinting to the possibility of the working class coming into power, in England, through universal suffrage'. Furthermore, he quotes Engels in a letter addressed to the Communist Committee in Brussels in October 1846. In this letter, Engels states that there cannot be any means of carrying out the communist agenda 'other than a democratic revolution by force' (''ibid.'' p. 10). Singh, however, does acknowledge the desire in Marx to avoid a bloody revolution.\nSingh (''ibid.'' p. 11) notes that most Marxist writing that alluded to the possibility of this transition being carried out peacefully took place before the events of 1844-48, which 'showed that a peaceful change was not even remotely possible'. After 1848, Singh notes a return to advocating a violent revolution due to what Singh identifies as the 'practical considerations' of being unable to overcome the existing obstacles to a peaceful transition. Singh (''ibid.'' p. 13) writes that, in 1848, Marx published an article titled ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/06.htm The Victory of Counter-Revolution in Vienna]'', where he states 'there is only one means by which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated - and that is by revolutionary terror'.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Magyar essay 1849\n|[https://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/marx/works/1849/01/13.htm ''The Magyar Struggle'']: \"Among all the large and small nations of Austria, only three standard-bearers of progress took an active part in history, and still retain their vitality \u2014 the Germans, the Poles and the Magyars.

But at the first victorious uprising of the French proletariat, which Louis Napoleon is striving with all his might to conjure up, the Austrian Germans and Magyars will be set free and wreak a bloody revenge on the Slav barbarians. The general war which will then break out will smash this Slav Sonderbund and wipe out all these petty hidebound nations, down to their very names.

Dread of political and economic pollution by the survival of antagonistic classes has been for the most extreme communist leaders what fear of racial pollution was for Hitler. There, also, material explanations fail to address the extent of the killings, gruesome tortures, fantastic trails, and attempts to wipe out whole categories of people that occurred in Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China, and Pol Pot's Cambodia. The revolutionary thinkers who formed and led communist regimes were not just ordinary intellectuals. They had to be fanatics in the true sense of that word. They were so certain of their ideas that no evidence to the contrary could change their minds. Those who came to doubt the rightness of their ways were eliminated, or never achieved power. The element of religious certitude found in prophetic movements was as important as their Marxist science in sustaining the notion that their vision of socialism could be made to work. This justified the ruthless dehumanization of their enemies, who could be suppressed because they were 'objectively' and 'historically' wrong. Furthermore, if events did not work out as they were supposed to, then that was because class enemies, foreign spies and saboteurs, or worst of all, internal traitors were wrecking the plan. Under no circumstances could it be admitted that the vision itself might be unworkable, because that meant capitulation to the forces of reaction. The logic of the situation in times of crisis then demanded that these 'bad elements' (as they were called in Maoist China) be killed, deported, or relegated to a permanently inferior status.

Later regimes consciously adapted their practices to the perceived successes and failures of earlier ones. The Khmer Rouge used China and the Soviet Union (and Vietnam and North Korea) as reference societies, while China used the Soviet Union. All addressed the same basic problem - how to apply a revolutionary vision of a future industrial society to a present agrarian one.

The ideological conviction of leaders promoting such a political scheme is thus decisive. Nevertheless, it would be far too simplistic an interpretation to assume that the sole purpose of inflicting these various forms of violence on civilians could only aim at instilling a climate of terror in this 'new society'. In fact, they are part of a broader whole, i.e. the spectrum of social engineering techniques implememted in order to transform a society completely. There can be no doubt that it is this utopia of a classless society which drives that kind of revolutionary project. The plan for political and social reshaping will thus logically claim victims in all strata of society. And through this process, communist systems emerging in the twentieth century ended up destroying their own populations, not because they planned to annihilate them as such, but because they aimed to restructure the 'social body' from top to bottom, even if that meant purging it and recarving it to suit their new Promethean political imaginaire.\"\n}}\n{{efn|name=Rosefielde motive 2010\n|{{harvnb|Rosefielde|2010|p=xvi}}: \"The story that emerges from the exercise is edifying.

The internal contradictions of communism confronted leaders with a predicament that could only have been efficiently resolved by acknowledging communism's inferiority and changing course. Denial offered two unhappy options: one bloody, the other dreary, and history records that more often than not, communist rulers chose the worst option. Tens of millions were killed in vain; a testament to the triumph of ruthless hope over dispassionate reason that proved more durable than Hitler's and Hirohito's racism.

Free-fire zones were established in depopulated areas, permitting Soviet troops to shoot anything that moved. In addition to killing tens of thousands in attacks on villages, this policy eventually produced one of the most massive refugee movements in modern history. Approximately 5 million people out of a total prewar population of between 15.5 and 17 million had fled the country by the early 1990s, the great majority across the border to Pakistan.

Such arguments in no way detract from the unique nature of Auschwitz - the mobilization of leading-edge technological resources and their use in an \"industrial process\" involving the construction of an \"extermination factory,\" the use of gas, and cremation. However, this argument highlights one particular feature of many Communist regimes - their systematic use of famine as a weapon. The regime aimed to control the total available food supply and, with immense ingenuity, to distribute food purely on the basis of \"merits\" and \"demerits\" earned by individuals. This policy was a recipe for creating famine on a massive scale. Remember that in the period after 1918, only Communist countries experienced such famines, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions, of people. And again in the 1980s, two African countries that claimed to be Marxist-Leninist, Ethiopia and Mozambique, were the only such countries to suffer these deadly famines.\"\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexandra|first=Goujon|title=Kurapaty (1937-1941): NKVD Mass Killings in Soviet Belarus|url=http://bo-k2s.sciences-po.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/kurapaty-1937-1941-nkvd-mass-killings-soviet-belarus|date=March 27, 2008|journal=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence|accessdate=April 25, 2020|issn=1961-9898}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|title=The Gulag's Veiled Mortality|url=https://www.hoover.org/news/gulags-veiled-mortality-golfo-alexopoulos|date=January 7, 2013|publisher=Hoover Institution|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}\n* {{citation|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|title=Illness and Inhumanity in Stalin's Gulag|date=April 25, 2017|publisher=Yale University|isbn=978-0-300-17941-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KSSMDgAAQBAJ|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}\n* {{citation|last=Allen|first=Paul|title=Katyn: Stalin's Massacre and the Seeds of Polish Resurrection|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55750-670-2}}\n* {{citation|last=Amstutz|first=Mark R.|title=International ethics: concepts, theories, and cases in global politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qTYko_PygLYC&pg=PA96&dq=mass+killing+communism#v=onepage|edition=2nd|date=January 28, 2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3583-1}}\n* {{citation|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher|last2=Mitrokhin|first2=Vasili|title=The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-00313-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4eSR1rHg5_YC&pg=PA457&dq=half+a+million+Red+Terror+of+1977+and+1978}}\n* {{citation|last=Andjelic|first=Neven|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina: The End of a Legacy|publisher=Frank Cass|year=2003|page=36|isbn=0-7146-5485-X}}\n* {{citation|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|title=The Worst of the Madness|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=November 11, 2010|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/11/worst-madness/?pagination=false}}\n* {{citation|last=Aronson|first=Ronald|title=Review: Communism's Posthumous Trial.
