In the 1990s, Ronaldo starred at club level for [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]], [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], and [[Inter Milan]]. His moves to Spain and Italy made him only the second player, after [[Diego Maradona]], to [[List of most expensive association football transfers#Historical progression|break the world transfer record twice]], all before his 21st birthday. By 23, he had scored over 200 goals for club and country. After almost three years of inactivity due to serious knee injuries and recuperation, Ronaldo joined [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 2002, which was followed by spells at [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]].\n\nRonaldo won the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] in 1996, 1997 and 2002, the [[Ballon d'Or]] in 1997 and 2002, and the [[UEFA Club Footballer of the Year]] in 1998. He was [[Don Bal\u00f3n Award|La Liga Best Foreign Player]] in 1997, when he also won the [[European Golden Boot]] after scoring 34 goals in La Liga, and he was named [[Serie A Footballer of the Year]] in 1998. One of the most marketable sportsmen in the world, the first [[Nike Mercurial Vapor|Nike Mercurial]] boots\u2013R9\u2013were commissioned for Ronaldo in 1998. He was named in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004 by [[Pel\u00e9]], and was inducted into the [[Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame]] and the [[Italian Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nRonaldo played for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals, and is the [[Brazil national football team#Top goalscorers|second-highest goalscorer]] for his national team, trailing only Pel\u00e9. At age 17, Ronaldo was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he received the [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|Golden Ball]] for player of the tournament, helping Brazil reach [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]] where he suffered a [[seizure|convulsive fit]] hours before the defeat to France. He won a second World Cup in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] where he starred in a front three with [[Rivaldo]] and [[Ronaldinho]]. Ronaldo scored twice in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], and received the [[FIFA World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] as the tournament's top goalscorer. At the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], Ronaldo scored his [[List of FIFA World Cup goalscorers#Top goalscorers|15th World Cup goal]], which was a World Cup record at the time. He also won the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in [[1997 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1997]], where he was player of the tournament, and [[1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1999]], where he was top goalscorer.\n\nHaving suffered further injuries, Ronaldo retired from professional football in 2011. As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position, he has been the outstanding influence for a generation of strikers that have followed. Post-retirement, Ronaldo has continued his work as a [[UNDP Goodwill Ambassador|United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador]], a position to which he was appointed in 2000. He served as an ambassador for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. Ronaldo became the majority owner of La Liga club [[Real Valladolid]] in September 2018 after buying 51% of the club's shares.\n\n==Early life==\nRonaldo Lu\u00eds Naz\u00e1rio de Lima was born on 18 September 1976 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, the third child of N\u00e9lio Naz\u00e1rio de Lima, Snr. and S\u00f4nia dos Santos Barata.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ronaldo's return to glory |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/special_events/sports_personality_2002/2556663.stm |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=BBC |date=8 December 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"Mosley\"/> Ronaldo has a brother, N\u00e9lio Jr.<ref name=\"Mosley\">{{cite book|title=Ronaldo: The Journey of a Genius|first1=James|last1=Mosley|year=2005|isbn=1-84018-964-9|publisher=Mainstream Publishing}}</ref><ref>Ronaldo: Manual de Vuelo (Brazil Documentary film) 1997</ref> His parents separated when he was 11, and Ronaldo dropped out of school shortly afterward to pursue a career in football.<ref name=\"Wash post\"/> He played on the streets of [[Bento Ribeiro]], a suburb of Rio de Janeiro.

In the 1990s, Ronaldo starred at club level for [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]], [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], and [[Inter Milan]]. His moves to Spain and Italy made him only the second player, after [[Diego Maradona]], to [[List of most expensive association football transfers#Historical progression|break the world transfer record twice]], all before his 21st birthday. By 23, he had scored over 200 goals for club and country. After almost three years of inactivity due to serious knee injuries and recuperation, Ronaldo joined [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 2002, which was followed by spells at [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]].\n\nRonaldo won the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] in 1996, 1997 and 2002, the [[Ballon d'Or]] in 1997 and 2002, and the [[UEFA Club Footballer of the Year]] in 1998. He was [[Don Bal\u00f3n Award|La Liga Best Foreign Player]] in 1997, when he also won the [[European Golden Boot]] after scoring 34 goals in La Liga, and he was named [[Serie A Footballer of the Year]] in 1998. One of the most marketable sportsmen in the world, the first [[Nike Mercurial Vapor|Nike Mercurial]] boots\u2013R9\u2013were commissioned for Ronaldo in 1998. He was named in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004 by [[Pel\u00e9]], and was inducted into the [[Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame]] and the [[Italian Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nRonaldo played for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals, and is the [[Brazil national football team#Top goalscorers|second-highest goalscorer]] for his national team, trailing only Pel\u00e9. At age 17, Ronaldo was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he received the [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|Golden Ball]] for player of the tournament, helping Brazil reach [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]] where he suffered a [[seizure|convulsive fit]] hours before the defeat to France. He won a second World Cup in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] where he starred in a front three with [[Rivaldo]] and [[Ronaldinho]]. Ronaldo scored twice in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], and received the [[FIFA World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] as the tournament's top goalscorer. At the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], Ronaldo scored his [[List of FIFA World Cup goalscorers#Top goalscorers|15th World Cup goal]], which was a World Cup record at the time. He also won the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in [[1997 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1997]], where he was player of the tournament, and [[1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1999]], where he was top goalscorer.\n\nHaving suffered further injuries, Ronaldo retired from professional football in 2011. As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position, he has been the outstanding influence for a generation of strikers that have followed. Post-retirement, Ronaldo has continued his work as a [[UNDP Goodwill Ambassador|United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador]], a position to which he was appointed in 2000. He served as an ambassador for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. Ronaldo became the majority owner of La Liga club [[Real Valladolid]] in September 2018 after buying 51% of the club's shares.\n\n==Early life==\nRonaldo Lu\u00eds Naz\u00e1rio de Lima was born on 18 September 1976 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, the third child of N\u00e9lio Naz\u00e1rio de Lima, Snr. and S\u00f4nia dos Santos Barata.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ronaldo's return to glory |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/special_events/sports_personality_2002/2556663.stm |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=BBC |date=8 December 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"Mosley\"/> Ronaldo has a brother, N\u00e9lio Jr.<ref name=\"Mosley\">{{cite book|title=Ronaldo: The Journey of a Genius|first1=James|last1=Mosley|year=2005|isbn=1-84018-964-9|publisher=Mainstream Publishing}}</ref><ref>Ronaldo: Manual de Vuelo (Brazil Documentary film) 1997</ref> His parents separated when he was 11, and Ronaldo dropped out of school shortly afterward to pursue a career in football.<ref name=\"Wash post\"/> He played on the streets of [[Bento Ribeiro]], a suburb of Rio de Janeiro.
