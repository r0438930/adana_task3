On May 20, 1861, North Carolina joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and all of the lenses were removed from the coastal lighthouses and navigational beacons to prevent Union forces from using the lights to navigate the coast.  [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops captured the nearby Beaufort and Morehead City in 1862 and, by the end of the next year, a third-order [[Fresnel lens]] was installed in the Cape Lookout lighthouse.  On April 2, 1864, a small group of Confederate troops under the command of L.C. Harland snuck through Union lines and out to the lighthouse. Their attempt to blow up the lighthouse was unsuccessful, however the explosion did destroy the lighthouse oil supply and damaged the iron stairs.  With iron unavailable during the war, the damaged sections of the stairs were replaced by wooden ones.  The Fresnel lenses from all the North Carolina lighthouses were found in 1865 in Raleigh, NC. The lenses were shipped back to their original manufacturers to be checked out and repaired.
