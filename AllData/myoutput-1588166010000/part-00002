It tells the story of [[Nausica\u00e4 (character)|Nausica\u00e4]], a princess of a small kingdom on a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Earth]] with a toxic [[ecosystem|ecological system]], who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an [[environmental disaster]] threatens humankind.\n\nPrior to creating ''Nausica\u00e4'', Miyazaki had worked as an animator for [[Toei Animation]], [[Nippon Animation]] and [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature film debut, ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro|Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (1979). After working on an aborted adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s ''Rowlf'' for TMS and the publishing firm [[Tokuma Shoten]], he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma's monthly magazine ''[[Animage]]'', initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. ''Nausica\u00e4'' was influenced by the Japanese folk tale ''[[The Lady who Loved Insects|The Princess who Loved Insects]]'', [[Nausicaa|a similarly-named character]] from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the [[Minamata Bay|Minamata Bay mercury pollution]], and various works of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] by Western writers, among other sources. The manga was serialized intermittently in ''Animage'' from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in [[North America]] by [[Viz Media]] from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 [[comic book]] issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.\n\nSince its initial serialization, ''Nausica\u00e4'' has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where at least 11 million copies have been sold. The manga and the 1984 [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|film adaptation]], written and directed by Miyazaki following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters,<!-- 'Following the serialization of' is probably more appropriate that 'based on', since this source (http://www.utdallas.edu/research/spacesciences/hairston/nausicaamanga_film.html - from the University of Dallas) covers the areas of the manga the film adapts and since this source (http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html) shows that chapters 15 and 16 are the opening chapters of vol. 3, none of which was adapted for the film. --> received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of ''Nausica\u00e4'' are also credited for the foundation of [[Studio Ghibli]], the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n{{See also|List of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind characters}}\n\nThe story is set in the future at the closing of the [[Ceramic engineering|ceramic]] era, 1,000 years after the Seven Days of Fire, a cataclysmic global war, in which [[Industrialisation|industrial civilization]] self-destructed. Although humanity survived, the land surface of the Earth is still heavily polluted and the seas have become poisonous. Most of the world is covered by the Sea of Corruption, a toxic forest of fungal life and plants which is steadily encroaching on the remaining open land. It is protected by large mutant insects, including the massive Ohmu. Humanity clings to survival in the polluted lands beyond the forest, periodically engaging in bouts of internecine fighting for the scarce resources that remain. The ability for space travel has been lost but the earth-bound remnants of humanity can still use [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[powered aircraft]] for exploration, transportation and warfare. (Powered [[Vehicles|land vehicles]] are mostly nonexistent, with humanity regressed to dependence on [[Working animal|riding animals and beasts-of-burden]].)\n\n===Plot===\n[[File:Nausicaa2p121.jpg|thumb|The Dorok prophecy: \"''And that one shall come to you garbed in raiment of blue and descending upon a field of gold''...\"]]\n\n[[Nausica\u00e4 (character)|Nausica\u00e4]] is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, a state on the periphery of what was once known as Eftal, a kingdom destroyed by the Sea of Corruption, a poisonous forest, 300 years ago. An inquisitive young woman, she explores the territories surrounding the Valley on a jet-powered glider, and studies the Sea of Corruption.\n\nThe valley of the wind lead by the aging and sick king Jhil, is subordinate to the Vai emperor of Tourumekia. Most cities, tribes, villages, valleys etc. of the new earth are in some form of another part of either Dorok or Torumekian command: Two massive nations that have been at odds or at war for thousand(s) of years. Torumekia has a large army, and does not appear to be religious. The Doroks are sectarian, with military and strategic higher ranks assigned to priests. Doroks and Torumekian people usually dislike each other, but there are various exceptions.\n\nThe Vai emperor has four children: 3 unnamed sons, and his daughter Kushana. The royal family is notorious for internal conflicts, backstabbing schemes, and desperate attempts to obtain or hold on to the power of the throne. The Doroks have a more stable government composed of the emperor, his brother, and the \u201cCouncil of Elders\u201d.\n\n==== Chapter 1: The Valley of the Wind. ====\nNausica\u00e4 is studying plants deep within the sea of corruption. While lying in peace and tranquillity on a dead ohmu shell, she suddenly has brief visions and flashes saying \u201c''Hate''\u201d or \u201c''Death''\u201d. Someone is being chased by a raging ohmu, and Nausica\u00e4 comes to the rescue by calming it down. Her teacher and good friend Yupa had accidentally angered an ohmu after an incident with a baby fox-squirrel. Nausica\u00e4 adopts the squirrel and names it \u201cTeto\u201d. They return to the valley of the wind.\n\nNausica\u00e4 tries out a gunship with her uncle Mito. She once again has similar visions and flashes of anger and hatred, and almost crashes the ship. In the distance they notice a refugee ship covered with insects. Their attempt to save it fails, and all the passagers die. In the wreckage and fire they meet and hear the dying words of Raspel: The princess of Torumekia-subsidiary Pejite. Apparently torumekian imperial guards working for the emperor invaded and burned down their entire village. Raspel hands Nausica\u00e4 a special stone that\u2019s she wants delivered to her brother, Asbel. The imperial guards are very interested in this stone, as they soon after show up with wormhandlers and examine and loot through all the dead bodies. They suspect the people of the valley of the wind are in possession of the stone, and immediately organize an attack.\n\nNausica\u00e4 has just returned to the valley when the torumekian troops attack. The imperial guards send in worm handlers to search for the stone, but Nausica\u00e4 stops them. Disgusted and angered by their attack and the realization that they disrespectfully looted the dead bodies, she engages in on-ground combat with one of the soldiers. Nausica\u00e4 impales the soldier from the neck with a knife, and - despite the fact that he is already dead - tries to stab him in the heart with a sword too. Yupa stops her (by taking a hit himself) and convinces both sides to stop fighting.\n\nThe Vai emperor declares war on the doroks. Kushana is quite dissatisfied with her role, and suspects a backstabbing scheme by her brothers. They have been assigned to work with large armies and big important battles with lots of loot and slaves, while she has been assigned but a few men to \u201cthreaten the enemy flank\u201d near the poisonous sea of corruption. She is also tasked with finding the stone. Her newly chosen staff officer / watchdog is Kurotowa.\n\nKushana forces a set of peripheries of Torumekia, including The Valley Of The Wind, to help in the war. They are to meet first by air. Aging king Jhil sends Nausica\u00e4, Mito, and a few others from the valley. In the air, many ships are suddenly shot down by a small gunship controlled by Aspel of Pejite. There are great losses, and many soldiers die. Aspel\u2019s plane is finally shot down, but he lands in the forest and survives. Nausica\u00e4 and her men crash by a lake in the sea of corruption. Ohmu appear from below the sea, and tell Nausica\u00e4 that they are ready, and that the northern forest has no use for them anymore. Soon after, a bunch of angry insects appear, all flying towards some destination in the south. Nausica\u00e4 follows the insects and accidentally meets Aspel. Surrounded by insects, they both cling to survival. In the end they are saved by the ohmu, who appear fond of Nausica\u00e4. When the insects leave, they are left in the deepest depths of the sea of corruption, but find, to their surprise, a clean and beautiful non-poisonous area with breathable air. Nausica\u00e4 hides the stone, Aspel fixes the wind glider, and they both take off\n\n==== Chapter 2: The Sea Of Corruption. ====\nNausica\u00e4 and Asbel are nearly shot down by a group of doroks known as the Mani tribe. Their leader comes out, and tells them to stop the fighting. He \u201cinvites\u201d Nausica\u00e4 and Asbel on board. Here they meet Ketcha, a girl from the Mani tribe. She tells Nausica\u00e4 to chat with their leader. Much of the Mani tribe and its land has been destroyed by Torumekian troops. The leader and his tribe are currently headed for the encampment were Kushana landed her forces to fix airships and prepare weapons and tactics. They were told this info has come from someone within the royal family. Nausica\u00e4 and Asbel realize that the Mani tribe\u2019s true plan is to raid the Torumekian-allied periphery lands (including the Valley of Wind) to replace their own lost land, and attempt to convince the Mani by force to do otherwise. The attempt fails, and Nausica\u00e4 flees from the ship, saved by Uncle Mito on a search mission.\n\nAt Kushana\u2019s camp, a battle suddenly breaks lose. Doroks soldiers had prepared a trap, and are now attacking the Torumekian and Periphery troops and airplanes. On top of this, the Doroks have a plan: A small \"flying jar\" squad is flying a baby Ohmu towards Kushana's encampent to attract a giant herd of massive angry Ohmu. The technique is successful, and all of Kushana\u2019s forces are brutally wiped out. Only her, Kurotowa, and a few loyal soldiers escape on a single airship. A warning from Nausicaa and Mito enabled all the Periphery troops and airships to narrowly escape (the chaos of the battle led to the Torumekians forces getting the warning too late). Nausicaa sees the baby Ohmu, and tries to stop the Dorok flying jar from advancing any further. She shoots down the flying jar that carries the Ohmu, and it crashes on a small sandbank in a lake of acid. The Ohmu is severely injured but alive, and although Nausica\u00e4 attempts to kill it using the jar's machine gun, she cannot bring herself to do so.  The herd appears, and the baby Ohmu tries to cross the acid lake in an attempt to reach the herd. Nausica\u00e4 tries to prevent this, and her foot is burned by the acid. The baby Ohmu stops and heals Nausica\u00e4 using its golden feelers, while its blood dyes her dress a deep, pure blue. The herd of Ohmu, still waiting on the banks, nearly commit mass-suicide in their attempt to walk through the lake of acid and retrieve the baby. Kushana's airship flies overhead, Nausica\u00e4 asks her to carry the Ohmu in exchange for all the information she knows about the Doroks and the stone. Kushana orders her ship to carry the Ohmu to the herd, and Nausica\u00e4 is celebrated and taken up by the Ohmu in their feelers so that it looks like she is standing in \u201ca field of gold\u201d.\n\nYupa is out searching for the secrets of the Sea of Corruption - it\u2019s cause, and how it works. He secretly breaks into a ship controlled by wormhandlers, and is taken to an underground wormhandler enclave that doubles as a Dorok base. The Mani tribe survivors, their priest, Asbel (in disguise as a Mani tribe warrior), and Ketcha are all there. A priest from the council of elders is disappointed with the Mani tribe leader, who has criticized the decision to use Ohmu in battle. Yupa, hiding in the pipes, hears the entire conversation, but is caught by a wormhandler. In the process of evading capture, he is caught entering a room where baby Ohmu are artificially bred in tanks. The wormhandlers attempt to capture Yupa under the orders of Dorok priests, but are unsuccessful. Right before a force of wormhandlers swarms Yupa, a \"Mani tribe warrior\" challenges him to a duel, a match which is approved of by the Dorok priests as a way for the Mani tribe to prove their loyalty. The Mani tribe warrior reveals himself to be Asbel, and shatters the incubation tank with his sword. He and Yupa flee immediately, and meet up with the Mani tribe priest on the surface. Just as the holy emperors brother Miralupa Kulubaluka appears, Yupa, Asbel, Ketcha, and the Mani tribe leader flee. In a telepathic confrontation with the emperor's brother the Mani leader states that the \"blue-clad one\" is real, and that the Dorok leaders are destroying the world, and will trigger a Daikaisho. The Mani tribe leader is stabbed to death by the imperial guards while Miralupa's astral projection searches for Nausica\u00e4, who is currently on Kushana's airship. The Mani tribe leader uses the last of his life force to protect Nausica\u00e4 from the astral projection, though Miralupa is still able to glimpse her face. During the commotion, Yupa, Asbel and Ketcha escape using the wormhandler airship that Yupa snuck in on.\n\n==== Chapter 3: The Dorok War. ====\nYupa, Aspel and Ketcha are caught in a thunderstorm, and struck down by a Dorok airship. The doroks send down wormhandlers to loot their bodies and make sure they are dead. Just as they\u2019re about to cut off Yupa\u2019s hand, they are met by \u201cThe forest people\u201d: An intelligent autonomous indigenous group of people that live in harmony with the sea of corruption through specialised equipment. The forest people are well-respected and worshipped by wormhandlers, so they let the bodies go. Yupa, Aspel and Ketcha have all survived the fall (somehow), and are taken in and treated by the forest people. The forest people explain that the purpose of the sea of corruption is actually to ''clean'' the poisonous air and soil. The trees and plants collect the miasma, and eventually break down to sand and dust.\n\nNausica\u00e4 has joined up with Kushana and Kurutowa. The ohmu told her they went south, and she wants to see why - might as well join up with Kushana and Kurotowa while she has the opportunity. Kushana\u2019s assigned mission has failed (she has neither confronted the enemy flank nor collected the stone) so she attempts to join up with the Third Army unit - which she trained herself. Kurutowa instead is hesitant and that she should join one of her brothers' armies, or goes directly to the Vai emperor, but Kushana sees through his scheme. Her mission was impossible to win, as she was only supposed to collect the stone and be executed for failing to do the rest. Kurutowa confesses that he was indeed sent to kill Kushana (by the Vai emperor himself), but that they might be able to strike up a deal nonetheless: He is to be killed in some way or another due to his entanglement in the royal family, but were he to follow Kushana he might still survive. She, on the other hand, can benefit from a pragmatic and talented staff officer, one that isn\u2019t merely loyal, but thinks for himself as well. Kushana accepts the deal, and they head off to search for the third army.\n\nOn the way, they fly across a small village being bombed by torumekian ships. Kushana and Kurotowa, being at this point enemies of the state, shoot down the ships, and look for the nearest well to get some water. Nausica\u00e4 flies down and explores the city: It appears all the villagers are dead not because of bombings or weapons, but from Miasma and poisoning, even though the village is more than 100 metres away from the nearest forest. Nausica\u00e4 tries to warn the other\u2019s not to go down the well, but a few soldiers end up severely poisoned. On top of the miasma there\u2019s a large insect down there, and it attempts to eat Nausica\u00e4. When it tastes the ohmu blood on her clothes though, it spits her out.\n\nThey fly away from the village. Flying close to the ground so as not to be spotted, they follow a few dorok ships that might lead them to the third army. Nausica\u00e4 notices the miasma getting very strong, and they enter a forest made only of poisonous fungi, so dense with miasma even the insects are dying. Kurotowa reluctantly raises the altitude and flies up above the clouds to the dorok ships. Just barely avoiding getting hit, they fly down again through the miasma and reach a hectic battlefield. A torumekian-occupied Dorok city is surrounded and being invaded by the dorok army, and a sector of Kushana\u2019s third army is trying to defend it. They are failing miserably, as they have been specialised and trained in quick offensives: Not defence. Kushana raises her flag and sword, and watches till the very end. Some of the soldiers had been poisoned by miasma out on the battlefield: The doroks seemed to be in control of it.\n\nKushana decides the next best move is to help another sector of her third army. They're protecting another occupied dorok castle/fort under dorok siege. The assigned leader of the defence is lazy and ruthless; He attempts to fly away with spoils and loot from the war, leaving his soldiers to die, but is stopped by Kushana. The torumekians have captured a bunch of dorok slaves, which Nausica\u00e4 naturally finds disgusting and morally corrupt. She demands that Kushana release the slaves, which is accepted on the condition that Nausica\u00e4 will ride with her on the battlefield.\n\nThe plan is to destroy heavy dorok artillery in a quick offensive. The attack is successful, but the escape will require killing a good many dorok troops. Nausica\u00e4 splits up from the group, attempting a more pacifist solution. It work\u2019s decently well, but a few soldiers must sacrifice their lives as human shields to prevent her from getting shot. Her riding-animal is shot by Charuka of the dorok council of elders. She is almost captured, but the animal regains a last burst of energy (because magic) and Nausica\u00e4 escapes.\n\nThe slaves are released. Charuka rides to the castle to thank the torumekians for their unexpected but kind deed.\n\n==== Chapter 4: Catastrophe. ====\nThough the attack was effective, the torumekian castle is still surrounded by dorok troops. All the airships that could save the soldiers have been taken away by Kushana's brothers to leave her own loyal soldiers to be sacrificed. Kushana and Kurotowa fly on a mission with some soldiers to the south to capture aircraft. They spot a single insect flying south in the same direction - a scout. It\u2019s shot down by an arrogant aristocrat on another aircraft, who drunkenly made a bet for money. In reaction to the death of the scout, a swarm of similar insects appear and attack and subsequently destroy the craft. To escape the angry swarm, Kurotowa pulls up and raises altitude. Above the clouds they find massive swarms of forest insects, all flying south. It\u2019s a mass migration, another so-called \u201cdaikaisho\u201d has begun.\n\nKushana uses the chaos of the upcoming insect attack in her mission to steal the needed aircraft - but her and Kurotowa's plane is rammed by the armoured corvette of one of Kushana\u2019s brothers. Her brother tries to kill them both. Kurotowa is badly injured from the ramming, but manages to buy some time. He and Kushana avoid getting shot just as the insects appear. The armoured corvette takes off, and in the distance is destroyed by insects. Kushana\u2019s most hated brother - the one that poisoned her mother - is dead. She had wanted to kill him her whole life, and suddenly he is just killed by insects, with no involvement from her.\n\nThe insects have really appeared now, and the camp is a bloodbath. Soldiers are killed, eaten, decapitated and crushed by insects everywhere. Hiding as well as they can in the trenches, it is a mere miracle that Kushana and badly-injured Kurotowa survive. A few of Kushana\u2019s best men are holding onto her in fear as the gruesome scene unfolds. Without noticing it herself, she sings a lullaby. She looks at a massive, angry insect directly in the eyes, but it does not choose to kill her.\n\nBack to Nausica\u00e4. She did not choose to follow Kushana, and instead went south on her glider alone - that ''was'' her original goal after all.&nbsp; She discovers a small, empty village. It was once an autonomous independent village, but was later destroyed by the dorok. In the village she meets Chikuku: A small kid with psychic abilities. Inside a religious building she is also greeted by a very old monk in meditation. He tells her that the daikaisho has begun, and that he is excited for \u201cthe great purification\u201d to begin. Nausica\u00e4 disagrees with the notion that everyone and everything has to die for a \u201cnew world to be reborn\u201d but does not get much time to further consider this topic, as a giant insect suddenly falls to the ground. Nausica\u00e4 and Chikuku take to the sky to see what\u2019s up, and notice in the near distance a huge swarm of insects attacking a dorok airship infested with some kind of mold.\n\nThe dorok emperor\u2019s brother Miralupa is on ship, and so is Charuka. Miralupa has issued an order to breed strong mold for use as biological weapons, but the mold has grown explosively and gotten out of hand. Nausica\u00e4 flies to the deck of the ship and is attacked by Miralupa. He has heard of a \u201cblue-clad one\u201d in prophecies and is obsessed with finding and killing Nausica\u00e4. His \u201cphysical form\u201d is old and weak, so he attempts to attack using psychic abilities. He fails. Charuka plans to burn down the ship to hopefully destroy the mold. Nausica\u00e4 helps him out, and they just barely manage to escape the explosive growth of the mold. Unfortunately, burning the ship did not destroy all the mold: A good bit survived and falls to the ground. As it falls to the ground, it forms an umbrella. It shows further signs of intelligence and sentience when scientists approach it by air, and it actively targets and attacks them. On the ground it feeds off dead insect bodies and grows drastically in size. It is shown to be attracted to other molds, as it at one point reaches over 100 metres up to get in contact with a small piece of mold on the scientist\u2019s ship.\n\n==== Chapter 5: Daikaisho. ====\nChapter 5 starts in Shuwa, the dorok capital city. The holy emperor, Namulith, looks at the god-warrior they have found and bred. It has grown, and he is satisfied, but for a moment afraid of it. On the ground, the council of elders, whom Namulith dislikes, accuses him of breaking many rules.\n\nNamulith is about a thousand years old - has gone through many painful transformative surgeries. His brother Miralupa is also very old, but has not chosen to change his body. Instead he has had operations and baths in painful chemicals to keep his original body living. Despite his role as emperor, Namulith has been in the shadows of his brother due to his lack of psychic abilities. Due to the incident with the airplane carrying mold, Miralupa\u2019s body was injured. He must undergo an operation, and Namulith decides to kill him by adding a poisonous substance to his chemical bath. Namulith says he no longer cares for the fate of the dorok people, but that he simply wants to watch the world burn, like it did in the seven days of fire.\n\nBack to Yupa, Ketcha, Aspel, and Mito. They are gathering information and trying to figure out what the torumekians are up to. Everything is chaos among the torumekians. They are in full retreat, looting every dorok village and city they go through of food and everything, and killing or taking every dorok as slaves, and leaving behind \"scorched Earth\". Yupa and the lot fly through this hellscape and come across many areas of doroks and torumekians killed by insects and the spreading forest. Eventually they find Kushana, her soldiers, and Kurotowa. After the insect attack and ensuing miasma, Kushana and her soldiers tried surviving in a crashed aircraft for about a month. They were just about to lose hope as another aircraft finally came. Aspel of Pejite is furious at Kushana for burning down his city, but they eventually decide to join up.\n\nNausica\u00e4, Charuka, and Chikuku are trying to get a hold of the mold. Fire and explosives do not seem to work. There are about three molds, and after mapping out their movements they conclude that they are trying to merge. To much the dismay of Charuka, Nausica\u00e4 and Chikuku use their psychic powers to impersonate a heavenly spirit, as to convince a city of doroks to find the highest hill they know if they want to survive. Nausica\u00e4 also explores an area in sky filled with insect\u2019s circle around some point. At the bottom she finds a dying, fully matured ohmu. She realizes that the insects and the ohmu are not trying to ''attack'' the mold: Rather they are trying to help it. The ohmu are using themselves as food for the mold, and the insects are trying to eat away it\u2019s pain. Nausica\u00e4 realizing just how hopeless the situation is, rides her glider to a hill where she sits alone. Some forest people come and give her a better mask, but she is intent on dying with the ohmu. She finds a heard of ohmu stampeding towards the merging point, jumps onto one, and reaches the middle. She lays on an ohmu as it is being covered with mold. Just before it dies, it opens its mouth and swallows Nausica\u00e4. Inside the ohmu, she is covered with a kind of protective bubble that makes her unconscious.\n\nYupa, Kushana, and the lot reach the city-fortress where she left the remnants of her third army. Now deserted thanks to an earlier evacuation warning from Nausicca, they find only a small group of her soldiers now dead along with a dead heedra, an artificial kind of creature designed for war. Its body regenerates, and it can only be killed by a destroying the brain. Living heedra show up and capture Kushana. Yupa jumps onto the plane that captures Kushana, and the others just barely survive taking off on their own aircraft.\n\nNamulith ordered the capture of Kushana. Not before long she regains consciousness, takes out all the guards, and battles up to the bridge to Namulith. He shows her that the soldiers of her third army are still alive. Namulith will save the soldiers on the condition that they marry, seize Torumekia together, and form a joint dorok-torumekian empire. &nbsp;\n\n==== Chapter 6: The Place Dreamed ====\nThe merging point of the molds grows to a massive forest in the matter of hours. Floods of wormhandler tribes migrate from their hidden villages; these longtime \"outcasts\" and \"untouchables\" now following the spreading forest and taking claim over the devastated Dorok territories.\n\nA forest person helps out Charuka and Chikuku find Nausica\u00e4. She\u2019s unconscious, and they need to find a place she can recover. On their way, they come across Namulith\u2019s ship. While Miralupa is dead, his spirit is somehow still alive, and he immediately rushes to possess Nausicaa. Charuka finds a place for Nausica\u00e4 to rest. Chikuku and the forest person stay, but Charuka returns to Namulith and the dorok army, aware it may be his death.\n\nWe see a dream vision Nausica\u00e4 has while unconscious. She is followed by Miralupa, personified as a scared, old, naked, ugly man. She enters a forest, and meets Selm, a forest person she has \u201cspiritually\u201d met previously in the story. He helps them both ride an ohmu to cross a river. The old man is very happy suddenly. They reach the end of the river and arrive at a petrified sea of corruption that has turned to dust. Beyond it, the nature is beautiful and clean. Grass grows, and there are birds, trees, etc. Miralupa's spirit is now at peace and remains in this clean \"afterlife\" paradise. Nausica\u00e4 wakes up.\n\nMito, Aspel, Ketcha, and Kurotowa accidentally land on the same mountain where Nausica\u00e4 is and all meet up. Forest people also show up, and followed by wormhandlers (all tribes of them now believing Nausica\u00e4 to be a messiah and saviour). They all decide to hurry to the spot where Namulith will marry Kushana. Charuka is being stoned until death on Namulith's orders, but Nausica\u00e4 manages to save him. Dorok ships arrive carrying the god-warrior, and Nausica\u00e4 orders Mito's aircraft to shoot them down. Namulith, Kushana (and secretly Yupa) take off on his ship with the god-warrior atop. Nausica\u00e4 lands on the deck and confronts Namulith. They battle, and he and his heedra gain the upper hand. Since Nausica\u00e4 still has the stone, the warrior awakens and saves her, calling her \"mother\". &nbsp;\n\nNamulith's artificially grown body is injured beyond repair by the god-warrior. He is tired of living and that \u201cThings always turn out as the master of the crypt says they will\u201d.\n\n==== Chapter 7: The Crypt. ====\nKushana, Nausica\u00e4, and the Vai emperor are all intent on going to the crypts of Shuwa. Nausica\u00e4 flies away with the god warrior, has an encounter with Kushana\u2019s brothers (who are also going to the crypt). Teto dies from the radioactive light emitted by the god warrior (whom Nausica\u00e4 has named \u201cOhma\u201d). She asks Ohma to land so she can bury the body. Sick from the light herself, she is offered help by a strange man.\n\nHe takes her to some nearby ruins that look normal and destroyed from the air, but beautifully covered with beautiful foliage and are alive with wonderful animals on the inside. Nausica\u00e4 meet\u2019s Kushana\u2019s brothers in there too. Even though everything seems nice, Nausica\u00e4 realizes something must be wrong, especially upon seeing heedra farmers. She attempts to escape, but is stopped by the man who led her in. She calls upon the spiritual help of Selm, and the man/creature tries to persuade Nausica\u00e4 to stay in the garden. Saving the world is impossible he says: Humans have ''adapted'' to the Poisonous air, and when the sea of corruption eventually cleans the soil, humans as we know them won\u2019t be able to live in the new world of clean air and nature. They\u2019ll cough up blood. He also mentions Namulith and Miralupa's father, the previous Dorok emperor, who centuries back had lived in this same garden and was once a young and hopeful man, intent on saving humanity and the world, and so seized the Dorok throne and made himself emperor. But over time he could not bear the weight of the whole world\u2019s problems and gradually became ruthless and evil.\n\nNausica\u00e4 leaves, and meet\u2019s up with Mito and a group of wormhandlers. She lies and tells them that after the sea of corruption cleans the earth, the world will be wonderful and easy.\n\nYupa, Ketcha, Charuka, Chikuku, Kushana, Kurotowa, the last third army soldiers, and floods of Dorok refugees have gathered on a mountain in the aftermath of Namulith's defeat and death. The Dorok tribes want revenge on the Torumekians and a new conflict is on the brink. Yupa sacrifices his life to protect Kushana and stop the conflict, in a scene that remind the Mani Tribe of what their own leader did to protect them.\n\nThe Vai emperor has already invaded Shuwa. With both emperors dead, it is an easy task. The real problem is entering the crypt itself, which is explosion and bullet proof, and shoots down all intruders with a laser-eye. Ohma has walked to Shuwa while Nausica\u00e4 was in the garden. He manages to shoot down the laser eye (with an explosion the size of an atom bomb) but destroys himself along with all of Shuwa and the Vai emperor's army in the process. The people inside the crypt come out to greet the Vai emperor. They are deliriously old from immortality technology. The Vai emperor walks inside, and Nausica\u00e4 with her tribe of wormhandlers follow shortly thereafter. Mito and Aspel have landed on top of the crypt: It seems to be an organism with regenerative abilities.\n\nNausica\u00e4 and the Vai emperor meet \u201cthe master of the crypt\u201d. ''It'' is a massive \"brain\" in the bottom of the crypt, covered with cryptic text. The people working in the crypt have been slowly deciphering the text for centuries. It contains all human knowledge and art from the old world. Throughout the years they have worked \u201csymbiotically\u201d with different powers: Protection in return for any technology the government might please. Nausica\u00e4 speaks with the Master, who takes the form of hundreds of scientists from the old world that worked to create it. The masters reengineered people to withstand the poisonous air and planned the sea of corruption. Having a power with access to advanced technology and biological tools of war would only speed up the process of destroying the old world so a new one could be reborn. The master says they have the tools to biologically change humans and have them stand the clean air again. Nausica\u00e4 disagrees with the notion that the old world must rot for a better one to appear; Especially since the master of the crypt itself will be in sole charge of creating a \u201cbetter\u201d world. While its intentions might have been pure once, over the course of 2000 years, it, like any other ruler, has been corrupted by power. The crypt thinks it can create a \u201cperfect\u201d world with no darkness, but that is impossible, thinks Nausica\u00e4. With the combined last powers of Ohma, a missile from Mito\u2019s ship, and Nausica\u00e4, the heart of the crypt is destroyed. The whole crypt falls apart, but Nausica\u00e4, the emperor and Aspel all manage to escape.\n\nNausicaa\u2019s friends and allies arrive, and everyone meet\u2019s up. The emperor is dying, and hands over the throne to Kushana. She rejects the offer. People all walk away from the crypt.<!--The country name is Torumekia, so this formulation is fine for identifying to whom they've become vassals.

That same year [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] serialization started of his manga ''[[Sabaku no Tami|People of the Desert]]''. His manga adaptation of [[D\u014dbutsu Takarajima|''Animal Treasure Island'']] was serialized in 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=219|2a1=Comic Box November 1|2y=1982|2p=111|3a1=Animage June 10|3y=1983|3pp=172,173}}\n\nAfter the December 1979 release of ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', Miyazaki, now at the [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS) subsidiary [[Telecom Animation Film]], began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s comic book ''Rowlf'' and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=249|2a1=Kan\u014d |2y=2007|2pp=37ff, 323}} Around that time Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by the editorial staff of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s ''[[Animage]]''. During subsequent conversations he showed his sketchbooks and talked about basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] and Osamu Kameyama, at the time working as editors for ''Animage''. They saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Initially two projects were proposed to Tokuma Shoten, that are significant for the eventual creation of Nausica\u00e4: {{Nihongo |''Warring States Demon Castle'' | \u6226\u56fd\u9b54\u57ce | Sengoku ma-j\u014d }}, to be set in the [[Sengoku period]], and an aborted adaptation of Corben's ''Rowlf'', but they were rejected, on July 9, 1981. The proposals were rejected because the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga and because the rights for the adaptation of ''Rowlf'' could not be secured.{{sfnm|1a1=DVD Japan|1y=2003|2a1=DVD UK|2y=2005|3a1=Art|3y=1984|3p=8|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=1996|4p=146|5a1=Miyazaki|5y=2007|5p=146|6a1=Haraguchi|6y=1996|6p=35}}\n\nAn agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=73|2a1=Saitani|2y=1995|2p=9}}{{efn|See in particular Miyazaki's answer to Saitani's question: \"Were you asked, from the beginning, to draw the comic with the intention of it becoming an animated work?\"{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} Miyazaki stated in an interview, \"''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' only really began to take shape once I agreed to serialize it.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Miyazaki|2y=2007|2p=149}} In the December 1981 issue of ''Animage'', it was announced that a new manga series would start in the February 1982 issue of the magazine, despite the fact that Miyazaki had not completed the first episode.

Miyazaki mentions Nakao in the context of a question he is asked about the place ''Nausica\u00e4'' takes in the ''ecology boom'' and does so explaining his shift from a desert to a forest setting. Nakao's influence on his work has been noted by Shiro Yoshioka.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=5|2a1=Yoshioka|2y=2008|p=262}} Miyazaki has identified Tetsuji Fukushima's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sabaku no ma\u014d|ja|3=\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b}}'' {{nihongo|\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b|The Evil Lord of the Desert}}, a story he first read while still in primary school, as one of his earliest influences.

Ogata persuaded Miyazaki to continue.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} [[Frederik L. Schodt]] observed differences between Nausica\u00e4 and other Japanese manga. He has noted that it was serialized in the large [[Paper size#A series|A4 size]] of ''Animage'', much larger than the normal size for manga. Schodt has also observed that Miyazaki drew much of Nausica\u00e4 in pencil without inking, and that the page and panel layouts, as well as the heavy reliance on storytelling, are more reminiscent of French comics than of Japanese manga. In appearance and sensibilities, ''Nausica\u00e4'' reminds Schodt of the works of [[M\u0153bius]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schodt|1y=1996|1p=278}}\n\nTakekuma has noted stylistic changes in Miyazaki's artwork over the course of the series. He points out that, particularly in the first chapters, the panels are densely filled with background, which makes the main characters difficult to discern without paying close attention. According to Takekuma this may be partially explained by Miyazaki's use of pencil, without inking, for much of the series. Takekuma points out that by employing pencil Miyazaki does not give himself the option of much variation in his line. He notes that in the later chapters Miyazaki uses his line art to, literally, draw attention to individuals and that he more frequently separates them from the background. As a result there are more panels in which the main characters stand out vividly in the latter part of the manga.{{sfnm|1a1=Takekuma|1y=2008}}\n\nMiyazaki has stated in interviews that he frequently worked close to publication deadlines and that he was not always able to finish his monthly instalments for serialization in ''Animage''. On such occasions he sometimes created apologetic cartoons. These were printed in the magazine, instead of story panels, to explain to his readers why there were fewer pages that month or why the story was absent entirely. Miyazaki has indicated that he continued making improvements to the story prior to the publication of the ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes, in which chapters from the magazine were collected in book form.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=17}} Changes made throughout the story, before the release of each ''tank\u014dbon'' volume, range from subtle additions of shading to the insertion of entirely new pages. Miyazaki also redrew panels and sometimes the artwork was changed on whole pages. He made alterations to the text and changed the order in which panels appeared.

He also noted that his continued struggle with the subject matter in the ongoing development of the Nausica\u00e4 manga allowed him to create different, lighter, films than he would have been able to make without Nausica\u00e4 providing an outlet for his more serious thoughts throughout the period of its creation.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=15\u201316}} Marc Hairston notes that, \u201cTellingly, Miyazaki\u2019s first film after finishing the ''Nausica\u00e4'' manga was ''[[Princess Mononoke|Mononoke Hime]]'', which examined many of the themes from the manga and is arguably the darkest film of his career.\u201d{{sfnm|1a1=Hairston|1y=2010|1p=177\u2013178}}\n\n===Localization===\n''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' was initially translated into English by [[Toren Smith]] and Dana Lewis. Smith, who had written comics in the U.S. since 1982, wrote an article on [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)#Warriors of the Wind|''Warriors of the Wind'']] (the heavily edited version of the film adaptation released in the U.S. in the 1980s) for the Japanese edition of [[Starlog]], in which he criticized what [[New World Pictures]] had done to Miyazaki's film. The article came to the attention of Miyazaki himself, who invited Smith to Studio Ghibli for a meeting. On Miyazaki's insistence, Smith's own company [[Studio Proteus]] was chosen as the producer of the English-language translation. Smith hired Dana Lewis to collaborate on the translation. Lewis was a professional translator in Japan who also wrote for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and had written cover stories for such science fiction magazines as ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' and ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Smith hired [[Tom Orzechowski]] for the lettering and retouching.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=44-47}}\n\nStudio Proteus was responsible for the translation, the lettering, and the retouching of the artwork, which was flipped left-to-right to accommodate English readers. The original Japanese dialogue was re-lettered by hand, the original sound effects were replaced by English sound effects, and the artwork was retouched to accommodate the new sound effects. When Miyazaki resumed work on the manga following one of the interruptions, Viz chose another team, including [[Rachel Matt Thorn]] and Wayne Truman, to complete the series.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=47}} The current seven-volume, English-language \"Editor's Choice\" edition is published in right-to-left reading order: while it retains the original translations, the lettering was done by Walden Wong.

She indicates that this was probably done inadvertently in the case of the manga translation, which retains animistic elements and contains [[pantheistic]] phrases, but may have been more deliberate in the translation of dialogue and narration for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s release of the film. In the case of the manga she attributes this \"Christianizing\" to the limitations of the languages involved, particularly the absence of precise English equivalents for Japanese words and concepts such as ''[[kami]]'', ''[[oni]]'' and ''[[Wrathful deities|kishin]]'' and honorific titles such as ''[[Japanese honorifics#Sama|sama]]''. As another explanation, she offers that translators of both the manga and the film work from a [[Judeo-Christian]] background, in a language suffused with Judeo-Christian [[idiom]]s not found in Japanese, which they introduce to the text, and she indicates that the translators work for an audience more accustomed to, and with the expectation of, the Judeo-Christian religions' [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], [[Conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] [[worldview]] in fictional narratives. Ogihara-Schuck concludes that particularly the film translation erased animistic motifs completely but that the manga translations, \"by enveloping the text in a dualistic world view\", also implicitly reintroduced this dualistic, good versus evil, worldview, absent in the original Japanese language manga, which she presumes to have been a strategy to make the works more accessible to the American audience.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133\u2013146}}\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\nThe manga was serialized in [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s monthly ''[[Animage]]'' magazine between 1982 and 1994.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=442\u2013445}} The series initially ran from the February 1982 issue to the November 1982 issue when the first interruption occurred due to Miyazaki's work related trip to Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Animage October 10|1y=1982|1p=181}} Serialization resumed in the December issue and the series ran again until June 1983 when it went on hiatus again due to Miyazaki's work on the film adaptation of the series. Serialization of the manga resumed for the third time from the August 1984 issue but halted again in the May 1985 issue when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on ''[[Laputa]]''. Serialization resumed for the fourth time in the December 1986 issue and was halted again in June 1987 when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on the films ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. The series resumed for the fifth time in the April 1990 issue and was halted in the May 1991 issue when Miyazaki worked on ''[[Porco Rosso]]''. The series resumed for the final time in the March 1993 issue. The final panel is dated January 28, 1994. The last chapter was released in the March 1994 issue of ''Animage''. By the end Miyazaki had created 59 chapters, of varying length, for publication in the magazine. In an interview, conducted shortly after serialization of the manga had ended, he noted that this amounts to approximately 5 years worth of material. He stated that he did not plan for the manga to run that long and that he wrote the story based on the idea that it could be stopped at any moment.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=9|2a1=Animage February 10|2y=1994|2p=204|3a1=Yom June 1|3y=1994|3p=3}}<ref name=\"chapter_guide\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html|title=Chapter guide | last=Ryan | first=Scott|work=Nausicaa.net | publisher=Team Ghiblink | accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe chapters were slightly modified and collected in seven ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes, in soft cover [[Paper size#Japanese B-series variant|B5 size]].<ref name=\"Ryan(Comparison)\"/> The first edition of volume one is dated September 25, 1982.

As of 2013 Viz Media has released the manga in five different formats. Initially the manga was printed flipped and with English translations of the sound effects. Publication of English editions began in 1988 with the release of episodes from the story under the title ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind'' in the \"Viz Select Comics\" series. This series ran until 1996. It consists of 27 issues. In October 1990 Viz Media also started publishing the manga as ''Viz Graphic Novel, Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind''. The last of the seven Viz Graphic Novels in this series appeared in January 1997. Viz media reprinted the manga in four volumes titled, ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind: Perfect Collection'', which were released from October 1995 to October 1997. A box set of the four volumes was later released in January 2000. In 2004 Viz Media re-released the seven-volume format in an \"Editors Choice\" edition titled ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind''. In this version the manga is left unflipped and the sound effects are left untranslated.<ref name=\"nausicaaworld\">{{Cite web| title = Nausica\u00e4 Around the World | url

serialization of the manga was underway and the story had proven to be popular among its readers, ''Animage'' came back on their promise not to turn the manga into an animation project and approached Miyazaki to make a 15 minute Nausica\u00e4 film. Miyazaki declined. Instead he proposed a sixty-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]]. In a counter offer Tokuma agreed to sponsor a feature-length film for theatrical release.<ref name= \"Animerica(1993)\">{{cite journal |last=Oshiguchi | first=Takashi | title=The whimsy and wonder of Hayao Miyazaki | journal=[[Animerica]]|volume=1|issue=5|date=July 1993|page=4}}</ref> The film adaptation of ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' was released on March 11, 1984. It was released before [[Studio Ghibli]] was established, but it is generally considered a Studio Ghibli film. Helen McCarthy has noted that it was Miyazaki's creation of the Nausica\u00e4 manga \" ... that had, in a way, started the actual process of his studio's development\".{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=45}} The film was released with a recommendation from the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)]].{{sfnm|1a1=Animage February 10|1y=1984|1p=181|2a1=Kan\u014d|2y=2007|2p=64}}\n\nIn his retrospective on ''50 years of Postwar Manga'', Osamu Takeuchi wrote that, in an ironic twist of fate, the ''Nausica\u00e4'' film had been playing in theatres, at the same time as the 1984 anime adaptation of one of the illustrated stories Miyazaki had grown up reading, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kenya Boy|ja|3=\u5c11\u5e74\u30b1\u30cb\u30e4}}'', originally written by {{Interlanguage link multi|Soji Yamakawa|ja|3=\u5c71\u5ddd\u60e3\u6cbb}} in 1951. Takeuchi observed that the release of its inspirational predecessor \"would have been devoured\" by Miyazaki's ''Nausica\u00e4'' in a competition of the two works. He went on to note that, in spite of a brief Yamakawa revival around that time, the media for story telling had progressed and a turning point in time had been passed.<ref name=\"Takeuchi(1995)\">{{cite book |last=Takeuchi |first=Osamu |date=April 5, 2002| origyear=first published March 30, 1995 |script-title=ja:\u6226\u5f8c\u30de\u30f3\u30ac50\u5e74\u53f2 |trans-title=50 Years of Post-War Manga|url=http://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480052018/ |language=Japanese |location=Tokyo |publisher=Chikuma Shobo |edition=5th | page=49 | isbn=978-4480052018 |accessdate=December 20, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe story of the ''Nausica\u00e4'' film is much simpler than that of the manga, roughly corresponding to the first two books of the manga, the point the story had reached when film production began.<ref name=\"chapter_guide\" /> In his interview for ''Yom'' (1994) Miyazaki explained that he worked from the precept that a film requires an opening and a closing of the story. He stated that, within the confines he set for closing the story, he took the film's narrative up to ''Nausica\u00e4's'' \"{{Nihongo|Copernican turn|\u30b3\u30da\u30eb\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u7684\u8ee2\u56de|koperunikusutekitenkai}}\", which came after the character realises the nature of the ''Sea of Corruption''.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=6}} There are significant differences in plot, with more locations, factions and characters appearing in the manga, as well as more detailed environmentalist themes. The tone of the manga is also more philosophical than the film. Miyazaki has ''Nausica\u00e4'' explore the concepts of fatalistic [[nihilism]] and has her struggle with the [[militarism]] of major powers. The series has been interpreted from the views of [[utopia]]n concepts, as well as religious studies.{{sfnm|1a1=Inaba|1y=1996|2a1=Yamanaka|2y=2008|2p=246ff|3a1=Masaki|3y=2001}}\n\nIn ''The Christianizing of Animism in Manga and Anime'', Eriko Ogihara-Schuck conducted a comparative analysis of the religious themes in the manga and the film. Ogihara-Schuck wrote that Miyazaki had started out with animistic themes, such a belief in the god of the wind, in the early chapters of the manga, had conflated the animistic and Judeo-Christian traditions in the anime adaptation, but had returned to the story by expanding on the animistic themes and by infusing it with a non-dualistic worldview when he created additional chapters of the manga, dissatisfied with the manner in which these themes had been handled for the film. Drawing on the scene in which ''Nausica\u00e4'' sacrifices her own life, in order to placate the stampeding Ohmu, and is subsequently resurrected by the miraculous powers of these giant insects, Ogihara-Schuck notes that \"Japanese scholars Takashi Sasaki and Masashi Shimizu consider ''Nausica\u00e4'' a Christ-like savior, and American scholar Susan Napier considers her as an active female messiah figure\". Ogihara-Schuck contrasts these views with Miyazaki's own belief in the omnipresence of gods and spirits and Hiroshi Aoi's argument that ''Nausica\u00e4's'' self-sacrifice is grounded on an animistic recognition of such spirits. Ogihara-Schuck quotes Miyazaki's comments in which he indicated that ''Nausica\u00e4's'' self-sacrifice is not as a savior of her people but is a decision driven by her desire to return the baby Ohmu and by her respect for nature, as she is \"dominated by animism\". Ogihara-Schuck concludes that in many of his later films, much more than in the anime version of ''Nausica\u00e4'', Miyazaki expressed his own belief in the animistic world view and is at his most direct in the manga by putting the dualistic world view and the animistic belief in tension and, through ''Nausica\u00e4's'' ultimate victory, makes the animistic world view superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133\u2013146}}\n\nNo chapters of the manga were published in the period between the July 1983 issue and the August 1984 issue of ''Animage'' but series of ''Nausica\u00e4 Notes'' and ''The Road to Nausicaa'' were printed in the magazine during this interim period.<ref name=\"chapter_guide\" /> Frequently illustrated with black and white images from the story boards as well as colour illustrations from the upcoming release of the film, these publications provide background about the history of the manga and development of the film. 1984 was declared The Year of Nausica\u00e4, on the cover of the February 1984 issue of ''Animage''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | script-title=ja:\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u30d2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30ab \u7b2c19\u56de 1984\u5e74\u306e\u300c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u300d | date=December 25, 2008 | publisher=Tokuma Shoten | language=Japanese | trans-title=Animage Historica, 19th episode, 1984's Animage | accessdate=December 30, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515071402/http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | archivedate=May 15, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Haraguchi|1y=1996|1p=61}}\n\n===Other===\nSeveral other Nausica\u00e4 related materials have been released. {{nihongo | ''Hayao Miyazaki's Image Board Collection'' | \u5bae\u5d0e\u99ff\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u96c6 | Miyazaki Hayao im\u0113jib\u014ddo-sh\u016b }} contains a selection from the sketchbooks Miyazaki created between 1980 and 1982 <!--Nausica\u00e4 related dates, the book obviously also contains ''Pipi'' concept drawings and other artwork created earlier --> to record his ideas for potential future projects.

It tells the story of [[Nausica\u00e4 (character)|Nausica\u00e4]], a princess of a small kingdom on a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Earth]] with a toxic [[ecosystem|ecological system]], who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an [[environmental disaster]] threatens humankind.\n\nPrior to creating ''Nausica\u00e4'', Miyazaki had worked as an animator for [[Toei Animation]], [[Nippon Animation]] and [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature film debut, ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro|Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (1979). After working on an aborted adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s ''Rowlf'' for TMS and the publishing firm [[Tokuma Shoten]], he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma's monthly magazine ''[[Animage]]'', initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. ''Nausica\u00e4'' was influenced by the Japanese folk tale ''[[The Lady who Loved Insects|The Princess who Loved Insects]]'', [[Nausicaa|a similarly-named character]] from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the [[Minamata Bay|Minamata Bay mercury pollution]], and various works of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] by Western writers, among other sources. The manga was serialized intermittently in ''Animage'' from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in [[North America]] by [[Viz Media]] from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 [[comic book]] issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.\n\nSince its initial serialization, ''Nausica\u00e4'' has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where at least 11 million copies have been sold. The manga and the 1984 [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|film adaptation]], written and directed by Miyazaki following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters,<!-- 'Following the serialization of' is probably more appropriate that 'based on', since this source (http://www.utdallas.edu/research/spacesciences/hairston/nausicaamanga_film.html - from the University of Dallas) covers the areas of the manga the film adapts and since this source (http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html) shows that chapters 15 and 16 are the opening chapters of vol. 3, none of which was adapted for the film. --> received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of ''Nausica\u00e4'' are also credited for the foundation of [[Studio Ghibli]], the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n{{See also|List of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind characters}}\n\nThe story is set in the future at the closing of the [[Ceramic engineering|ceramic]] era, 1,000 years after the Seven Days of Fire, a cataclysmic global war, in which [[Industrialisation|industrial civilization]] self-destructed. Although humanity survived, the land surface of the Earth is still heavily polluted and the seas have become poisonous. Most of the world is covered by the Sea of Corruption, a toxic forest of fungal life and plants which is steadily encroaching on the remaining open land. It is protected by large mutant insects, including the massive Ohmu. Humanity clings to survival in the polluted lands beyond the forest, periodically engaging in bouts of internecine fighting for the scarce resources that remain. The ability for space travel has been lost but the earth-bound remnants of humanity can still use [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[powered aircraft]] for exploration, transportation and warfare. (Powered [[Vehicles|land vehicles]] are mostly nonexistent, with humanity regressed to dependence on [[Working animal|riding animals and beasts-of-burden]].)\n\n===Plot===\n[[File:Nausicaa2p121.jpg|thumb|The Dorok prophecy: \"''And that one shall come to you garbed in raiment of blue and descending upon a field of gold''...\"]]\n\n[[Nausica\u00e4 (character)|Nausica\u00e4]] is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, a state on the periphery of what was once known as Eftal, a kingdom destroyed by the Sea of Corruption, a poisonous forest, 300 years ago. An inquisitive young woman, she explores the territories surrounding the Valley on a jet-powered glider, and studies the Sea of Corruption.\n\nThe valley of the wind lead by the aging and sick king Jhil, is subordinate to the Vai emperor of Tourumekia. Most cities, tribes, villages, valleys ect. of the new earth are in some form of another part of either Dorok or Torumekian command: Two massive nations that have been at odds or at war for thousand(s) of years. Torumekia has a large army, and does not appear to be religious. The Doroks are sectarian, with military and strategic higher ranks assigned to priests. Doroks and Torumekian people usually dislike each other, but there are various exceptions.\n\nThe Vai emporer has four children: 3 unnamed sons, and his daughter Kushana. The royal family is notorious for internal conflicts, backstabbing schemes, and desperate attempts to obtain or hold on to the power of the throne. The Doroks have a more stable government composed of the emperor, his brother, and the \u201cCouncil of Elders\u201d.\n\n==== Chapter 1: The Valley of the Wind. ====\nNausica\u00e4 is studying plants deep within the sea of corruption. While lying in peace and tranquillity on a dead ohmu shell, she suddenly has brief visions and flashes saying \u201c''Hate''\u201d or \u201c''Death''\u201d. Someone is being chased by a raging ohmu, and Nausica\u00e4 comes to the rescue by calming it down. Her teacher and good friend Yupa had accidentally angered an ohmu after an incident with a baby fox-squirrel. Nausica\u00e4 adopts the squirrel and names it \u201cTeto\u201d. They return to the valley of the wind.\n\nNausica\u00e4 tries out a gunship with her uncle Mito. She once again has similar visions and flashes of anger and hatred, and almost crashes the ship. In the distance they notice a refugee ship covered with insects. Their attempt to save it fails, and all the passagers die. In the wreckage and fire they meet and hear the dying words of Raspel: The princess of Torumekia-subsidiary Pejite. Apparently torumekian imperial guards working for the emporer invaded and burned down their entire village. Raspel hands Nausica\u00e4 a special stone that\u2019s she wants delivered to her brother, Asbel. The imperial guards are very interested in this stone, as they soon after show up with wormhandlers and examine and loot through all the dead bodies. They suspect the people of the valley of the wind are in possession of the stone, and immediately organize an attack.\n\nNausica\u00e4 has just returned to the valley when the torumekian troops attack. The imperial guards send in worm handlers to search for the stone, but Nausica\u00e4 stops them. Disgusted and angered by their attack and the realization that they disrespectfully looted the dead bodies, she engages in on-ground combat with one of the soldiers. Nausica\u00e4 impales the soldier from the neck with a knife, and - despite the fact that he is already dead - tries to stab him in the heart with a sword too. Yupa stops her (by taking a hit himself) and convinces both sides to stop fighting.\n\nThe Vai emporer declares war on the doroks. Kushana is quite dissatisfied with her role, and suspects a backstabbing scheme by her brothers. They have been assigned to work with large armies and big important battles with lots of loot and slaves, while she has been assigned but a few men to \u201cthreaten the enemy flank\u201d near the poisonous sea of corruption. She is also tasked with finding the stone. Her newly chosen staff officer / watchdog is Kurotowa.\n\nKushana forces a set of peripheries of Torumekia, including The Valley Of The Wind, to help in the war. They are to meet first by air. Aging king Jhil sends Nausica\u00e4, Mito, and a few others from the valley. In the air, many ships are suddenly shot down by a small gunship controlled by Aspel of Pejite. There are great losses, and many soldiers die. Aspel\u2019s plane is finally shot down, but he lands in the forest and survives. Nausica\u00e4 and her men crash by a lake in the sea of corruption. Ohmu appear from below the sea, and tell Nausica\u00e4 that they are ready, and that the northern forest has no use for them anymore. Soon after, a bunch of angry insects appear, all flying towards some destination in the south. Nausica\u00e4 follows the insects and accidentally meets Aspel. Surrounded by insects, they both cling to survival. In the end they are saved by the ohmu, who appear fond of Nausica\u00e4. When the insects leave, they are left in the deepest depths of the sea of corruption, but find, to their surprise, a clean and beautiful non-poisonous area with breathable air. Nausica\u00e4 hides the stone, Aspel fixes the wind glider, and they both take off\n\n==== Chapter 2: The Sea Of Corruption. ====\nNausica\u00e4 and Asbel are nearly shot down by a group of doroks known as the Mani tribe. Their leader comes out, and tells them to stop the fighting. He \u201cinvites\u201d Nausica\u00e4 and Asbel on board. Here they meet Ketcha, a girl from the Mani tribe. She tells Nausica\u00e4 to chat with their leader. Much of the Mani tribe and its land has been destroyed by Torumekian troops. The leader and his tribe are currently headed for the encampment were Kushana landed her forces to fix airships and prepare weapons and tactics. They were told this info has come from someone within the royal family. Nausica\u00e4 and Asbel realize that the Mani tribe\u2019s true plan is to raid the Torumekian-allied periphery lands (including the Valley of Wind) to replace their own lost land, and attempt to convince the Mani by force to do otherwise. The attempt fails, and Nausica\u00e4 flees from the ship, saved by Uncle Mito on a search mission.\n\nAt Kushana\u2019s camp, a battle suddenly breaks lose. Doroks soldiers had prepared a trap, and are now attacking the Torumekian and Periphery troops and airplanes. On top of this, the Doroks have a plan: A small \"flying jar\" squad is flying a baby Ohmu towards Kushana's encampent to attract a giant herd of massive angry Ohmu. The technique is successful, and all of Kushana\u2019s forces are brutally wiped out. Only her, Kurotowa, and a few loyal soldiers escape on a single airship. A warning from Nausicaa and Mito enabled all the Periphery troops and airships to narrowly escape (the chaos of the battle led to the Torumekians forces getting the warning too late). Nausicaa sees the baby Ohmu, and tries to stop the Dorok flying jar from advancing any further. She shoots down the flying jar that carries the Ohmu, and it crashes on a small sandbank in a lake of acid. The Ohmu is severely injured but alive, and although Nausica\u00e4 attempts to kill it using the jar's machine gun, she cannot bring herself to do so.  The herd appears, and the baby Ohmu tries to cross the acid lake in an attempt to reach the herd. Nausica\u00e4 tries to prevent this, and her foot is burned by the acid. The baby Ohmu stops and heals Nausica\u00e4 using its golden feelers, while its blood dyes her dress a deep, pure blue. The herd of Ohmu, still waiting on the banks, nearly commit mass-suicide in their attempt to walk through the lake of acid and retrieve the baby. Kushana's airship flies overhead, Nausica\u00e4 asks her to carry the Ohmu in exchange for all the information she knows about the Doroks and the stone. Kushana orders her ship to carry the Ohmu to the herd, and Nausica\u00e4 is celebrated and taken up by the Ohmu in their feelers so that it looks like she is standing in \u201ca field of gold\u201d.\n\nYupa is out searching for the secrets of the Sea of Corruption - it\u2019s cause, and how it works. He secretly breaks into a ship controlled by wormhandlers, and is taken to an underground wormhandler enclave that doubles as a Dorok base. The Mani tribe survivors, their priest, Asbel (in disguise as a Mani tribe warrior), and Ketcha are all there. A priest from the council of elders is disappointed with the Mani tribe leader, who has criticized the decision to use Ohmu in battle. Yupa, hiding in the pipes, hears the entire conversation, but is caught by a wormhandler. In the process of evading capture, he is caught entering a room where baby Ohmu are artificially bred in tanks. The wormhandlers attempt to capture Yupa under the orders of Dorok priests, but are unsuccessful. Right before a force of wormhandlers swarms Yupa, a \"Mani tribe warrior\" challenges him to a duel, a match which is approved of by the Dorok priests as a way for the Mani tribe to prove their loyalty. The Mani tribe warrior reveals himself to be Asbel, and shatters the incubation tank with his sword. He and Yupa flee immediately, and meet up with the Mani tribe priest on the surface. Just as the holy emperors brother Miralupa Kulubaluka appears, Yupa, Asbel, Ketcha, and the Mani tribe leader flee. In a telepathic confrontation with the emperor's brother the Mani leader states that the \"blue-clad one\" is real, and that the Dorok leaders are destroying the world, and will trigger a Daikaisho. The Mani tribe leader is stabbed to death by the imperial guards while Miralupa's astral projection searches for Nausica\u00e4, who is currently on Kushana's airship. The Mani tribe leader uses the last of his life force to protect Nausica\u00e4 from the astral projection, though Miralupa is still able to glimpse her face. During the commotion, Yupa, Asbel and Ketcha escape using the wormhandler airship that Yupa snuck in on.\n\n==== Chapter 3: The Dorok War. ====\nYupa, Aspel and Ketcha are caught in a thunderstorm, and struck down by a Dorok airship. The doroks send down wormhandlers to loot their bodies and make sure they are dead. Just as they\u2019re about to cut off Yupa\u2019s hand, they are met by \u201cThe forest people\u201d: An intelligent autonomous indigenous group of people that live in harmony with the sea of corruption through specialised equipment. The forest people are well-respected and worshipped by wormhandlers, so they let the bodies go. Yupa, Aspel and Ketcha have all survived the fall (somehow), and are taken in and treated by the forest people. The forest people explain that the purpose of the sea of corruption is actually to ''clean'' the poisonous air and soil. The trees and plants collect the miasma, and eventually break down to sand and dust.\n\nNausica\u00e4 has joined up with Kushana and Kurutowa. The ohmu told her they went south, and she wants to see why - might as well join up with Kushana and Kurotowa while she has the opportunity. Kushana\u2019s assigned mission has failed (she has neither confronted the enemy flank nor collected the stone) so she attempts to join up with the Third Army unit - which she trained herself. Kurutowa instead is hesitant and that she should join one of her brothers' armies, or goes directly to the Vai emperor, but Kushana sees through his scheme. Her mission was impossible to win, as she was only supposed to collect the stone and be executed for failing to do the rest. Kurutowa confesses that he was indeed sent to kill Kushana (by the Vai emperor himself), but that they might be able to strike up a deal nonetheless: He is to be killed in some way or another due to his entanglement in the royal family, but were he to follow Kushana he might still survive. She, one the other hand, can benefit from a pragmatic and talented staff officer, one that isn\u2019t merely loyal, but thinks for himself as well. Kushana accepts the deal, and they head off to search for the third army.\n\nOn the way, they fly across a small village being bombed by torumekian ships. Kushana and Kurotowa, being at this point enemies of the state, shoot down the ships, and look for the nearest well to get some water. Nausica\u00e4 flies down and explores the city: It appears all the villagers are dead not because of bombings or weapons, but from Miasma and poisoning, even though the village is more than 100 metres away from the nearest forest. Nausica\u00e4 tries to warn the other\u2019s not to go down the well, but a few soldiers end up severely poisoned. On top of the miasma there\u2019s a large insect down there, and it attempts to eat Nausica\u00e4. When it tastes the ohmu blood on her clothes though, it spits her out.\n\nThey fly away from the village. Flying close to the ground so as not to be spotted, they follow a few dorok ships that might lead them to the third army. Nausica\u00e4 notices the miasma getting very strong, and they enter a forest made only of poisonous fungi, so dense with miasma even the insects are dying. Kurotowa reluctantly raises the altitude and flies up above the clouds to the dorok ships. Just barely avoiding getting hit, they fly down again through the miasma and reach a hectic battlefield. A torumekian-occupied Dorok city is surrounded and being invaded by the dorok army, and a sector of Kushana\u2019s third army is trying to defend it. They are failing miserably, as they have been specialised and trained in quick offensives: Not defence. Kushana raises her flag and sword, and watches till the very end. Some of the soldiers had been poisoned by miasma out on the battlefield: The doroks seemed to be in control of it. \n\nKushana decides the next best move is to help another sector of her third army. They're protecting another occupied dorok castle/fort under dorok siege. The assigned leader of the defence is lazy and ruthless; He attempts to fly away with spoils and loot from the war, leaving his soldiers to die, but is stopped by Kushana. The torumekians have captured a bunch of dorok slaves, which Nausica\u00e4 naturally finds disgusting and morally corrupt. She demands that Kushana release the slaves, which is accepted on the condition that Nausica\u00e4 will ride with her on the battlefield.\n\nThe plan is to destroy heavy dorok artillery in a quick offensive. The attack is successful, but the escape will require killing a good many dorok troops. Nausica\u00e4 splits up from the group, attempting a more pacifist solution. It work\u2019s decently well, but a few soldiers must sacrifice their lives as human shields to prevent her from getting shot. Her riding-animal is shot by Charuka of the dorok council of elders. She is almost captured, but the animal regains a last burst of energy (because magic) and Nausica\u00e4 escapes.\n\nThe slaves are released. Charuka rides to the castle to thank the torumekians for their unexpected but kind deed.\n\n==== Chapter 4: Catastrophe. ====\nThough the attack was effective, the torumekian castle is still surrounded by dorok troops. All the airships that could save the soldiers have been taken away by Kushana's brothers to leave her own loyal soldiers to be sacrificed. Kushana and Kurotowa fly on a mission with some soldiers to the south to capture aircraft. They spot a single insect flying south in the same direction - a scout. It\u2019s shot down by an arrogant aristocrat on another aircraft, who drunkenly made a bet for money. In reaction to the death of the scout, a swarm of similar insects appear and attack and subsequently destroy the craft. To escape the angry swarm, Kurotowa pulls up and raises altitude. Above the clouds they find massive swarms of forest insects, all flying south. It\u2019s a mass migration, another so-called \u201cdaikaisho\u201d has begun.\n\nKushana uses the chaos of the upcoming insect attack in her mission to steal the needed aircraft - but her and Kurotowa's plane is rammed by the armoured corvette of one of Kushana\u2019s brothers. Her brother tries to kill them both. Kurotowa is badly injured from the ramming, but manages to buy some time. He and Kushana avoid getting shot just as the insects appear. The armoured corvette takes off, and in the distance is destroyed by insects. Kushana\u2019s most hated brother - the one that poisoned her mother - is dead. She had wanted to kill him her whole life, and suddenly he is just killed by insects, with no involvement from her.\n\nThe insects have really appeared now, and the camp is a bloodbath. Soldiers are killed, eaten, decapitated and crushed by insects everywhere. Hiding as well as they can in the trenches, it is a mere miracle that Kushana and badly-injured Kurotowa survive. A few of Kushana\u2019s best men are holding onto her in fear as the gruesome scene unfolds. Without noticing it herself, she sings a lullaby. She looks at a massive, angry insect directly in the eyes, but it does not choose to kill her.\n\nBack to Nausica\u00e4. She did not choose to follow Kushana, and instead went south on her glider alone - that ''was'' her original goal after all.&nbsp; She discovers a small, empty village. It was once an autonomous independent village, but was later destroyed by the dorok. In the village she meets Chikuku: A small kid with psychic abilities. Inside a religious building she is also greeted by a very old monk in meditation. He tells her that the daikaisho has begun, and that he is excited for \u201cthe great purification\u201d to begin. Nausica\u00e4 disagrees with the notion that everyone and everything has to die for a \u201cnew world to be reborn\u201d but does not get much time to further consider this topic, as a giant insect suddenly falls to the ground. Nausica\u00e4 and Chikuku take to the sky to see what\u2019s up, and notice in the near distance a huge swarm of insects attacking a dorok airship infested with some kind of mold.\n\nThe dorok emperor\u2019s brother Miralupa is on ship, and so is Charuka. Miralupa has issued an order to breed strong mold for use as biological weapons, but the mold has grown explosively and gotten out of hand. Nausica\u00e4 flies to the deck of the ship and is attacked by Miralupa. He has heard of a \u201cblue-clad one\u201d in prophecies and is obsessed with finding and killing Nausica\u00e4. His \u201cphysical form\u201d is old and weak, so he attempts to attack using psychic abilities. He fails. Charuka plans to burn down the ship to hopefully destroy the mold. Nausica\u00e4 helps him out, and they just barely manage to escape the explosive growth of the mold. Unfortunately, burning the ship did not destroy all the mold: A good bit survived and falls to the ground. As it falls to the ground, it forms an umbrella. It shows further signs of intelligence and sentience when scientists approach it by air, and it actively targets and attacks them. On the ground it feeds off dead insect bodies and grows drastically in size. It is shown to be attracted to other molds, as it at one point reaches over 100 metres up to get in contact with a small piece of mold on the scientist\u2019s ship.\n\n==== Chapter 5: Daikaisho. ====\nChapter 5 starts in Shuwa, the dorok capital city. The holy emperor, Namulith, looks at the god-warrior they have found and bred. It has grown, and he is satisfied, but for a moment afraid of it. On the ground, the council of elders, whom Namulith dislikes, accuses him of breaking many rules.\n\nNamulith is about a thousand years old - has gone through many painful transformative surgeries. His brother Miralupa is also very old, but has not chosen to change his body. Instead he has had operations and baths in painful chemicals to keep his original body living. Despite his role as emperor, Namulith has been in the shadows of his brother due to his lack of psychic abilities. Due to the incident with the airplane carrying mold, Miralupa\u2019s body was injured. He must undergo an operation, and Namulith decides to kill him by adding a poisonous substance to his chemical bath. Namulith says he no longer cares for the fate of the dorok people, but that he simply wants to watch the world burn, like it did in the seven days of fire.\n\nBack to Yupa, Ketcha, Aspel, and Mito. They are gathering information and trying to figure out what the torumekians are up to. Everything is chaos among the torumekians. They are in full retreat, looting every dorok village and city they go through of food and everything, and killing or taking every dorok as slaves, and leaving behind \"scorched Earth\". Yupa and the lot fly through this hellscape and come across many areas of doroks and torumekians killed by insects and the spreading forest. Eventually they find Kushana, her soldiers, and Kurotowa. After the insect attack and ensuing miasma, Kushana and her soldiers tried surviving in a crashed aircraft for about a month. They were just about to lose hope as another aircraft finally came. Aspel of Pejite is furious at Kushana for burning down his city, but they eventually decide to join up.\n\nNausica\u00e4, Charuka, and Chikuku are trying to get a hold of the mold. Fire and explosives do not seem to work. There are about three molds, and after mapping out their movements they conclude that they are trying to merge. To much the dismay of Charuka, Nausica\u00e4 and Chikuku use their psychic powers to impersonate a heavenly spirit, as to convince a city of doroks to find the highest hill they know if they want to survive. Nausica\u00e4 also explores an area in sky filled with insect\u2019s circle around some point. At the bottom she finds a dying, fully matured ohmu. She realizes that the insects and the ohmu are not trying to ''attack'' the mold: Rather they are trying to help it. The ohmu are using themselves as food for the mold, and the insects are trying to eat away it\u2019s pain. Nausica\u00e4 realizing just how hopeless the situation is, rides her glider to a hill where she sits alone. Some forest people come and give her a better mask, but she is intent on dying with the ohmu. She finds a heard of ohmu stampeding towards the merging point, jumps onto one, and reaches the middle. She lays on an ohmu as it is being covered with mold. Just before it dies, it opens its mouth and swallows Nausica\u00e4. Inside the ohmu, she is covered with a kind of protective bubble that makes her unconscious. \n\nYupa, Kushana, and the lot reach the city-fortress where she left the remnants of her third army. Now deserted thanks to an earlier evacuation warning from Nausicca, they find only a small group of her soldiers now dead along with a dead heedra, an artificial kind of creature designed for war. Its body regenerates, and it can only be killed by a destroying the brain. Living heedra show up and capture Kushana. Yupa jumps onto the plane that captures Kushana, and the others just barely survive taking off on their own aircraft.\n\nNamulith ordered the capture of Kushana. Not before long she regains consciousness, takes out all the guards, and battles up to the bridge to Namulith. He shows her that the soldiers of her third army are still alive. Namulith will save the soldiers on the condition that they marry, seize Torumekia together, and form a joint dorok-torumekian empire. &nbsp;\n\n==== Chapter 6: The Place Dreamed ====\nThe merging point of the molds grows to a massive forest in the matter of hours. Floods of wormhandler tribes migrate from their hidden villages; these longtime \"outcasts\" and \"untouchables\" now following the spreading forest and taking claim over the devastated Dorok territories. \n\nA forest person helps out Charuka and Chikuku find Nausica\u00e4. She\u2019s unconscious, and they need to find a place she can recover. On their way, they come across Namulith\u2019s ship. While Miralupa is dead, his spirit is somehow still alive, and he immediately rushes to possess Nausicaa. Charuka finds a place for Nausica\u00e4 to rest. Chikuku and the forest person stay, but Charuka returns to Namulith and the dorok army, aware it may be his death.\n\nWe see a dream vision Nausica\u00e4 has while unconscious. She is followed by Miralupa, personified as a scared, old, naked, ugly man. She enters a forest, and meets Selm, a forest person she has \u201cspiritually\u201d met previously in the story. He helps them both ride an ohmu to cross a river. The old man is very happy suddenly. They reach the end of the river and arrive at a petrified sea of corruption that has turned to dust. Beyond it, the nature is beautiful and clean. Grass grows, and there are birds, trees, etc. Miralupa's spirit is now at peace and remains in this clean \"afterlife\" paradise. Nausica\u00e4 wakes up.\n\nMito, Aspel, Ketcha, and Kurotowa accidentally land on the same mountain where Nausica\u00e4 is and all meet up. Forest people also show up, and followed by wormhandlers (all tribes of them now believing Nausica\u00e4 to be a messiah and saviour). They all decide to hurry to the spot where Namulith will marry Kushana. Charuka is being stoned until death on Namulith's orders, but Nausica\u00e4 manages to save him. Dorok ships arrive carrying the god-warrior, and Nausica\u00e4 orders Mito's aircraft to shoot them down. Namulith, Kushana (and secretly Yupa) take off on his ship with the god-warrior atop. Nausica\u00e4 lands on the deck and confronts Namulith. They battle, and he and his heedra gain the upper hand. Since Nausica\u00e4 still has the stone, the warrior awakens and saves her, calling her \"mother\". &nbsp;\n\nNamulith's artificially grown body is injured beyond repair by the god-warrior. He is tired of living and that \u201cThings always turn out as the master of the crypt says they will\u201d.\n\n==== Chapter 7: The Crypt. ====\nKushana, Nausica\u00e4, and the Vai emperor are all intent on going to the crypts of Shuwa. Nausica\u00e4 flies away with the god warrior, has an encounter with Kushana\u2019s brothers (who are also going to the crypt). Teto dies from the radioactive light emitted by the god warrior (whom Nausica\u00e4 has named \u201cOhma\u201d). She asks Ohma to land so she can bury the body. Sick from the light herself, she is offered help by a strange man. \n\nHe takes her to some nearby ruins that look normal and destroyed from the air, but beautifully covered with beautiful foliage and are alive with wonderful animals on the inside. Nausica\u00e4 meet\u2019s Kushana\u2019s brothers in there too. Even though everything seems nice, Nausica\u00e4 realizes something must be wrong, especially upon seeing heedra farmers. She attempts to escape, but is stopped by the man who led her in. She calls upon the spiritual help of Selm, and the man/creature tries to persuade Nausica\u00e4 to stay in the garden. Saving the world is impossible he says: Humans have ''adapted'' to the Poisonous air, and when the sea of corruption eventually cleans the soil, humans as we know them won\u2019t be able to live in the new world of clean air and nature. They\u2019ll cough up blood. He also mentions Namulith and Miralupa's father, the previous Dorok emperor, who centuries back had lived in this same garden and was once a young and hopeful man, intent on saving humanity and the world, and so seized the Dorok throne and made himself emperor. But over time he could not bear the weight of the whole world\u2019s problems and gradually became ruthless and evil. \n\nNausica\u00e4 leaves, and meet\u2019s up with Mito and a group of wormhandlers. She lies and tells them that after the sea of corruption cleans the earth, the world will be wonderful and easy. \n\nYupa, Ketcha, Charuka, Chikuku, Kushana, Kurotowa, the last third army soldiers, and floods of Dorok refugees have gathered on a mountain in the aftermath of Namulith's defeat and death. The Dorok tribes want revenge on the Torumekians and a new conflict is on the brink. Yupa sacrifices his life to protect Kushana and stop the conflict, in a scene that remind the Mani Tribe of what their own leader did to protect them.\n\nThe Vai emperor has already invaded Shuwa. With both emperors dead, it is an easy task. The real problem is entering the crypt itself, which is explosion and bullet proof, and shoots down all intruders with a laser-eye. Ohma has walked to Shuwa while Nausica\u00e4 was in the garden. He manages to shoot down the laser eye (with an explosion the size of an atom bomb) but destroys himself along with all of Shuwa and the Vai emperor's army in the process. The people inside the crypt come out to greet the Vai emperor. They are deliriously old from immortality technology. The Vai emperor walks inside, and Nausica\u00e4 with her tribe of wormhandlers follow shortly thereafter. Mito and Aspel have landed on top of the crypt: It seems to be an organism with regenerative abilities.\n\nNausica\u00e4 and the Vai emperor meet \u201cthe master of the crypt\u201d. ''It'' is a massive \"brain\" in the bottom of the crypt, covered with cryptic text. The people working in the crypt have been slowly deciphering the text for centuries. It contains all human knowledge and art from the old world. Throughout the years they have worked \u201csymbiotically\u201d with different powers: Protection in return for any technology the government might please. Nausica\u00e4 speaks with the Master, who takes the form of hundreds of scientists from the old world that worked to create it. The masters reengineered people to withstand the poisonous air and planned the sea of corruption. Having a power with access to advanced technology and biological tools of war would only speed up the process of destroying the old world so a new one could be reborn. The master says they have the tools to biologically change humans and have them stand the clean air again. Nausica\u00e4 disagrees with the notion that the old world must rot for a better one to appear; Especially since the master of the crypt itself will be in sole charge of creating a \u201cbetter\u201d world. While its intentions might have been pure once, over the course of 2000 years, it, like any other ruler, has been corrupted by power. The crypt thinks it can create a \u201cperfect\u201d world with no darkness, but that is impossible, thinks Nausica\u00e4. With the combined last powers of Ohma, a missile from Mito\u2019s ship, and Nausica\u00e4, the heart of the crypt is destroyed. The whole crypt falls apart, but Nausica\u00e4, the emperor and Aspel all manage to escape.\n\nNausicaa\u2019s friends and allies arrive, and everyone meet\u2019s up. The emperor is dying, and hands over the throne to Kushana. She rejects the offer. People all walk away from the crypt.<!--The country name is Torumekia, so this formulation is fine for identifying to whom they've become vassals.

That same year [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] serialization started of his manga ''[[Sabaku no Tami|People of the Desert]]''. His manga adaptation of [[D\u014dbutsu Takarajima|''Animal Treasure Island'']] was serialized in 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=219|2a1=Comic Box November 1|2y=1982|2p=111|3a1=Animage June 10|3y=1983|3pp=172,173}}\n\nAfter the December 1979 release of ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', Miyazaki, now at the [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS) subsidiary [[Telecom Animation Film]], began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s comic book ''Rowlf'' and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=249|2a1=Kan\u014d |2y=2007|2pp=37ff, 323}} Around that time Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by the editorial staff of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s ''[[Animage]]''. During subsequent conversations he showed his sketchbooks and talked about basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] and Osamu Kameyama, at the time working as editors for ''Animage''. They saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Initially two projects were proposed to Tokuma Shoten, that are significant for the eventual creation of Nausica\u00e4: {{Nihongo |''Warring States Demon Castle'' | \u6226\u56fd\u9b54\u57ce | Sengoku ma-j\u014d }}, to be set in the [[Sengoku period]], and an aborted adaptation of Corben's ''Rowlf'', but they were rejected, on July 9, 1981. The proposals were rejected because the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga and because the rights for the adaptation of ''Rowlf'' could not be secured.{{sfnm|1a1=DVD Japan|1y=2003|2a1=DVD UK|2y=2005|3a1=Art|3y=1984|3p=8|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=1996|4p=146|5a1=Miyazaki|5y=2007|5p=146|6a1=Haraguchi|6y=1996|6p=35}}\n\nAn agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=73|2a1=Saitani|2y=1995|2p=9}}{{efn|See in particular Miyazaki's answer to Saitani's question: \"Were you asked, from the beginning, to draw the comic with the intention of it becoming an animated work?\"{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} Miyazaki stated in an interview, \"''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' only really began to take shape once I agreed to serialize it.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Miyazaki|2y=2007|2p=149}} In the December 1981 issue of ''Animage'', it was announced that a new manga series would start in the February 1982 issue of the magazine, despite the fact that Miyazaki had not completed the first episode.

Miyazaki mentions Nakao in the context of a question he is asked about the place ''Nausica\u00e4'' takes in the ''ecology boom'' and does so explaining his shift from a desert to a forest setting. Nakao's influence on his work has been noted by Shiro Yoshioka.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=5|2a1=Yoshioka|2y=2008|p=262}} Miyazaki has identified Tetsuji Fukushima's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sabaku no ma\u014d|ja|3=\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b}}'' {{nihongo|\u6c99\u6f20\u306e\u9b54\u738b|The Evil Lord of the Desert}}, a story he first read while still in primary school, as one of his earliest influences.

Ogata persuaded Miyazaki to continue.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} [[Frederik L. Schodt]] observed differences between Nausica\u00e4 and other Japanese manga. He has noted that it was serialized in the large [[Paper size#A series|A4 size]] of ''Animage'', much larger than the normal size for manga. Schodt has also observed that Miyazaki drew much of Nausica\u00e4 in pencil without inking, and that the page and panel layouts, as well as the heavy reliance on storytelling, are more reminiscent of French comics than of Japanese manga. In appearance and sensibilities, ''Nausica\u00e4'' reminds Schodt of the works of [[M\u0153bius]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schodt|1y=1996|1p=278}}\n\nTakekuma has noted stylistic changes in Miyazaki's artwork over the course of the series. He points out that, particularly in the first chapters, the panels are densely filled with background, which makes the main characters difficult to discern without paying close attention. According to Takekuma this may be partially explained by Miyazaki's use of pencil, without inking, for much of the series. Takekuma points out that by employing pencil Miyazaki does not give himself the option of much variation in his line. He notes that in the later chapters Miyazaki uses his line art to, literally, draw attention to individuals and that he more frequently separates them from the background. As a result there are more panels in which the main characters stand out vividly in the latter part of the manga.{{sfnm|1a1=Takekuma|1y=2008}}\n\nMiyazaki has stated in interviews that he frequently worked close to publication deadlines and that he was not always able to finish his monthly instalments for serialization in ''Animage''. On such occasions he sometimes created apologetic cartoons. These were printed in the magazine, instead of story panels, to explain to his readers why there were fewer pages that month or why the story was absent entirely. Miyazaki has indicated that he continued making improvements to the story prior to the publication of the ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes, in which chapters from the magazine were collected in book form.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=17}} Changes made throughout the story, before the release of each ''tank\u014dbon'' volume, range from subtle additions of shading to the insertion of entirely new pages. Miyazaki also redrew panels and sometimes the artwork was changed on whole pages. He made alterations to the text and changed the order in which panels appeared. The story as re-printed in the ''tank\u014dbon'' spans 7 volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages.<ref name=\"Ryan(Comparison)\">{{Cite web| title=Nausica\u00e4 Manga Comparison | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/naucompare.html | last=Ryan | first= Scott | publisher=Nausicaa.net | accessdate=December 31, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMiyazaki has said that the lengthy creation process of the ''Nausica\u00e4'' manga, repeatedly tackling its themes as the story evolved over the years, not only changed the material but also affected his personal views on life and changed his political perspectives. He also noted that his continued struggle with the subject matter in the ongoing development of the Nausica\u00e4 manga allowed him to create different, lighter, films than he would have been able to make without Nausica\u00e4 providing an outlet for his more serious thoughts throughout the period of its creation.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=15\u201316}} Marc Hairston notes that, \u201cTellingly, Miyazaki\u2019s first film after finishing the ''Nausica\u00e4'' manga was ''[[Princess Mononoke|Mononoke Hime]]'', which examined many of the themes from the manga and is arguably the darkest film of his career.\u201d{{sfnm|1a1=Hairston|1y=2010|1p=177\u2013178}}\n\n===Localization===\n''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' was initially translated into English by [[Toren Smith]] and Dana Lewis. Smith, who had written comics in the U.S. since 1982, wrote an article on [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)#Warriors of the Wind|''Warriors of the Wind'']] (the heavily edited version of the film adaptation released in the U.S. in the 1980s) for the Japanese edition of [[Starlog]], in which he criticized what [[New World Pictures]] had done to Miyazaki's film. The article came to the attention of Miyazaki himself, who invited Smith to Studio Ghibli for a meeting. On Miyazaki's insistence, Smith's own company [[Studio Proteus]] was chosen as the producer of the English-language translation. Smith hired Dana Lewis to collaborate on the translation. Lewis was a professional translator in Japan who also wrote for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and had written cover stories for such science fiction magazines as ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' and ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Smith hired [[Tom Orzechowski]] for the lettering and retouching.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=44-47}}\n\nStudio Proteus was responsible for the translation, the lettering, and the retouching of the artwork, which was flipped left-to-right to accommodate English readers. The original Japanese dialogue was re-lettered by hand, the original sound effects were replaced by English sound effects, and the artwork was retouched to accommodate the new sound effects. When Miyazaki resumed work on the manga following one of the interruptions, Viz chose another team, including [[Rachel Matt Thorn]] and Wayne Truman, to complete the series.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=47}} The current seven-volume, English-language \"Editor's Choice\" edition is published in right-to-left reading order: while it retains the original translations, the lettering was done by Walden Wong.

She indicates that this was probably done inadvertently in the case of the manga translation, which retains animistic elements and contains [[pantheistic]] phrases, but may have been more deliberate in the translation of dialogue and narration for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s release of the film. In the case of the manga she attributes this \"Christianizing\" to the limitations of the languages involved, particularly the absence of precise English equivalents for Japanese words and concepts such as ''[[kami]]'', ''[[oni]]'' and ''[[Wrathful deities|kishin]]'' and honorific titles such as ''[[Japanese honorifics#Sama|sama]]''. As another explanation, she offers that translators of both the manga and the film work from a [[Judeo-Christian]] background, in a language suffused with Judeo-Christian [[idiom]]s not found in Japanese, which they introduce to the text, and she indicates that the translators work for an audience more accustomed to, and with the expectation of, the Judeo-Christian religions' [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], [[Conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] [[worldview]] in fictional narratives. Ogihara-Schuck concludes that particularly the film translation erased animistic motifs completely but that the manga translations, \"by enveloping the text in a dualistic world view\", also implicitly reintroduced this dualistic, good versus evil, worldview, absent in the original Japanese language manga, which she presumes to have been a strategy to make the works more accessible to the American audience.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133\u2013146}}\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\nThe manga was serialized in [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s monthly ''[[Animage]]'' magazine between 1982 and 1994.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=442\u2013445}} The series initially ran from the February 1982 issue to the November 1982 issue when the first interruption occurred due to Miyazaki's work related trip to Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Animage October 10|1y=1982|1p=181}} Serialization resumed in the December issue and the series ran again until June 1983 when it went on hiatus again due to Miyazaki's work on the film adaptation of the series. Serialization of the manga resumed for the third time from the August 1984 issue but halted again in the May 1985 issue when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on ''[[Laputa]]''. Serialization resumed for the fourth time in the December 1986 issue and was halted again in June 1987 when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on the films ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. The series resumed for the fifth time in the April 1990 issue and was halted in the May 1991 issue when Miyazaki worked on ''[[Porco Rosso]]''. The series resumed for the final time in the March 1993 issue. The final panel is dated January 28, 1994. The last chapter was released in the March 1994 issue of ''Animage''. By the end Miyazaki had created 59 chapters, of varying length, for publication in the magazine. In an interview, conducted shortly after serialization of the manga had ended, he noted that this amounts to approximately 5 years worth of material. He stated that he did not plan for the manga to run that long and that he wrote the story based on the idea that it could be stopped at any moment.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=9|2a1=Animage February 10|2y=1994|2p=204|3a1=Yom June 1|3y=1994|3p=3}}<ref name=\"chapter_guide\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html|title=Chapter guide | last=Ryan | first=Scott|work=Nausicaa.net | publisher=Team Ghiblink | accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe chapters were slightly modified and collected in seven ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes, in soft cover [[Paper size#Japanese B-series variant|B5 size]].<ref name=\"Ryan(Comparison)\"/> The first edition of volume one is dated September 25, 1982.

serialization of the manga was underway and the story had proven to be popular among its readers, ''Animage'' came back on their promise not to turn the manga into an animation project and approached Miyazaki to make a 15 minute Nausica\u00e4 film. Miyazaki declined. Instead he proposed a sixty-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]]. In a counter offer Tokuma agreed to sponsor a feature-length film for theatrical release.<ref name= \"Animerica(1993)\">{{cite journal |last=Oshiguchi | first=Takashi | title=The whimsy and wonder of Hayao Miyazaki | journal=[[Animerica]]|volume=1|issue=5|date=July 1993|page=4}}</ref> The film adaptation of ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' was released on March 11, 1984. It was released before [[Studio Ghibli]] was established, but it is generally considered a Studio Ghibli film. Helen McCarthy has noted that it was Miyazaki's creation of the Nausica\u00e4 manga \" ... that had, in a way, started the actual process of his studio's development\".{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=45}} The film was released with a recommendation from the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)]].{{sfnm|1a1=Animage February 10|1y=1984|1p=181|2a1=Kan\u014d|2y=2007|2p=64}}\n\nIn his retrospective on ''50 years of Postwar Manga'', Osamu Takeuchi wrote that, in an ironic twist of fate, the ''Nausica\u00e4'' film had been playing in theatres, at the same time as the 1984 anime adaptation of one of the illustrated stories Miyazaki had grown up reading, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kenya Boy|ja|3=\u5c11\u5e74\u30b1\u30cb\u30e4}}'', originally written by {{Interlanguage link multi|Soji Yamakawa|ja|3=\u5c71\u5ddd\u60e3\u6cbb}} in 1951. Takeuchi observed that the release of its inspirational predecessor \"would have been devoured\" by Miyazaki's ''Nausica\u00e4'' in a competition of the two works. He went on to note that, in spite of a brief Yamakawa revival around that time, the media for story telling had progressed and a turning point in time had been passed.<ref name=\"Takeuchi(1995)\">{{cite book |last=Takeuchi |first=Osamu |date=April 5, 2002| origyear=first published March 30, 1995 |script-title=ja:\u6226\u5f8c\u30de\u30f3\u30ac50\u5e74\u53f2 |trans-title=50 Years of Post-War Manga|url=http://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480052018/ |language=Japanese |location=Tokyo |publisher=Chikuma Shobo |edition=5th | page=49 | isbn=978-4480052018 |accessdate=December 20, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe story of the ''Nausica\u00e4'' film is much simpler than that of the manga, roughly corresponding to the first two books of the manga, the point the story had reached when film production began.<ref name=\"chapter_guide\" /> In his interview for ''Yom'' (1994) Miyazaki explained that he worked from the precept that a film requires an opening and a closing of the story. He stated that, within the confines he set for closing the story, he took the film's narrative up to ''Nausica\u00e4's'' \"{{Nihongo|Copernican turn|\u30b3\u30da\u30eb\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u7684\u8ee2\u56de|koperunikusutekitenkai}}\", which came after the character realises the nature of the ''Sea of Corruption''.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=6}} There are significant differences in plot, with more locations, factions and characters appearing in the manga, as well as more detailed environmentalist themes. The tone of the manga is also more philosophical than the film. Miyazaki has ''Nausica\u00e4'' explore the concepts of fatalistic [[nihilism]] and has her struggle with the [[militarism]] of major powers. The series has been interpreted from the views of [[utopia]]n concepts, as well as religious studies.{{sfnm|1a1=Inaba|1y=1996|2a1=Yamanaka|2y=2008|2p=246ff|3a1=Masaki|3y=2001}}\n\nIn ''The Christianizing of Animism in Manga and Anime'', Eriko Ogihara-Schuck conducted a comparative analysis of the religious themes in the manga and the film. Ogihara-Schuck wrote that Miyazaki had started out with animistic themes, such a belief in the god of the wind, in the early chapters of the manga, had conflated the animistic and Judeo-Christian traditions in the anime adaptation, but had returned to the story by expanding on the animistic themes and by infusing it with a non-dualistic worldview when he created additional chapters of the manga, dissatisfied with the manner in which these themes had been handled for the film. Drawing on the scene in which ''Nausica\u00e4'' sacrifices her own life, in order to placate the stampeding Ohmu, and is subsequently resurrected by the miraculous powers of these giant insects, Ogihara-Schuck notes that \"Japanese scholars Takashi Sasaki and Masashi Shimizu consider ''Nausica\u00e4'' a Christ-like savior, and American scholar Susan Napier considers her as an active female messiah figure\". Ogihara-Schuck contrasts these views with Miyazaki's own belief in the omnipresence of gods and spirits and Hiroshi Aoi's argument that ''Nausica\u00e4's'' self-sacrifice is grounded on an animistic recognition of such spirits. Ogihara-Schuck quotes Miyazaki's comments in which he indicated that ''Nausica\u00e4's'' self-sacrifice is not as a savior of her people but is a decision driven by her desire to return the baby Ohmu and by her respect for nature, as she is \"dominated by animism\". Ogihara-Schuck concludes that in many of his later films, much more than in the anime version of ''Nausica\u00e4'', Miyazaki expressed his own belief in the animistic world view and is at his most direct in the manga by putting the dualistic world view and the animistic belief in tension and, through ''Nausica\u00e4's'' ultimate victory, makes the animistic world view superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133\u2013146}}\n\nNo chapters of the manga were published in the period between the July 1983 issue and the August 1984 issue of ''Animage'' but series of ''Nausica\u00e4 Notes'' and ''The Road to Nausicaa'' were printed in the magazine during this interim period.<ref name=\"chapter_guide\" /> Frequently illustrated with black and white images from the story boards as well as colour illustrations from the upcoming release of the film, these publications provide background about the history of the manga and development of the film. 1984 was declared The Year of Nausica\u00e4, on the cover of the February 1984 issue of ''Animage''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | script-title=ja:\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u30d2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30ab \u7b2c19\u56de 1984\u5e74\u306e\u300c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u300d | date=December 25, 2008 | publisher=Tokuma Shoten | language=Japanese | trans-title=Animage Historica, 19th episode, 1984's Animage | accessdate=December 30, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515071402/http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | archivedate=May 15, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Haraguchi|1y=1996|1p=61}}\n\n===Other===\nSeveral other Nausica\u00e4 related materials have been released. {{nihongo | ''Hayao Miyazaki's Image Board Collection'' | \u5bae\u5d0e\u99ff\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u96c6 | Miyazaki Hayao im\u0113jib\u014ddo-sh\u016b }} contains a selection from the sketchbooks Miyazaki created between 1980 and 1982 <!--Nausica\u00e4 related dates, the book obviously also contains ''Pipi'' concept drawings and other artwork created earlier --> to record his ideas for potential future projects.
