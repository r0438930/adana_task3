This season featured 16 HouseGuests.\n\nThe premise of the series remained largely unchanged from previous editions of the series, in which a group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last HouseGuest remaining. Each week, one HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees, and the HouseGuest with the most votes is evicted. When only two HouseGuests remained, the last nine evicted HouseGuests would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. \n\nThe September 5, 2013, broadcast marked the show's 500th

For this competition, HouseGuests were put into a tournament-style bracket. The object was to roll a ball down a curved banana and have it land on top of the ice cream sundae. The first HouseGuest to get the ball on the sundae, moved on to the next round. Andy was the winner. Andy was also tasked with picking four HouseGuests as Have-Nots for the week and chose Aaryn, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen. On Day 50, Jessie and Spencer were nominated for eviction. Elissa, Amanda, and Helen were picked to play in the veto competition, while McCrae was selected to host. That same day, HouseGuests competed in the \"BBB Movie\" Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given a few minutes to study three movie sets. They were then asked questions about how many of a certain item there were in a set. If the HouseGuest was confident in their answer, they would \"stay\" for an attempt at winning a movie ticket. The housemate that was closest to the correct answer would receive a movie ticket, while the others were eliminated. If they were not confident they would \"fold\" and stay in the competition regardless of their answer. The first HouseGuest to obtain three movie tickets would be the winner. Andy was the winner. On Day 53, Andy chose not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 56, in a unanimous vote of 6\u20130, Jessie was evicted and became the third jury member.\n\nFollowing Jessie's eviction, Aaryn won her fourth Head of Household of the season in the \"Way Off Broadway\" HoH competition. Later that day, Julie Chen revealed to the audience that one of the four jury members would be coming back on the next weeks eviction night. On Day 57, the HouseGuests competed in the Have-Not competition, \"The Black Box\". In this competition, the HouseGuests had to enter a big, pitch-black box with many crawl spaces and gags, find the key, and exit the black box and hit a button to stop the timer. Amanda, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen were the Have-Nots for the week. Aaryn then chose to nominate Elissa and Helen, with Helen being her target. Andy, GinaMarie, and Spencer were selected to play in the Veto competition. On Day 58, Elissa went on to win her second Veto competition of the season. Elissa used the Veto to remove her nomination, and Aaryn nominated Spencer in her stead. On Day 63, Helen was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, with Elissa being the only one to vote for Spencer.\n\nShortly after Helen's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests and first four jurors competed in the \"Off the Wall\" competition, which functioned as both the HoH and re-entry competition. The HouseGuests and jurors were to stand on platforms and catch balls thrown at them without falling off. The first player overall to catch 10 balls or last to remain standing would be the new HoH, and the first juror to do so would return to the game. Judd was the last juror left standing and returned to the game as a HouseGuest, and Elissa was the first to catch 10 balls and became Head of Household. On Day 64, Elissa nominated Aaryn and McCrae for eviction. On Day 65, Amanda, GinaMarie, and Judd were selected to play in the Veto competition. Amanda won the Veto competition, her first individual competition win of the season. On Day 67, Amanda used the Power of Veto to save McCrae, causing Elissa to name Andy the replacement nominee. On Day 70, Aaryn was evicted by a vote of 5\u20130.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\">{{cite magazine|title = 'Big Brother 15': Latest Houseguest Evicted, Audience Gets Vocal|date = August 29, 2013|url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-brother-15-ninth-houseguest-617564|last = Ng|first = Philiana|magazine = The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Aaryn's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests began the \"Big Hopportunity\" competition. The HouseGuests were to hop to a wall made from chicken wire. There, each HouseGuest navigated their egg them through a maze formed by the letters \"HoH\" to a hole at the far side. They then had to hop back down and drop the egg in their basket. GinaMarie was the first HouseGuest with a dozen eggs and won the HoH. On the live show, Julie Chen also announced that the HouseGuests will compete in a special competition, and a live double eviction during Week 10.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\" /> On Day 71, GinaMarie chose to nominate Amanda and McCrae for eviction. On Day 72, Spencer, Andy, and Elissa were selected to play in the Veto competition. McCrae won the Veto competition. On Day 74, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer was once again named the replacement nominee. On Day 77, Amanda was evicted in a 3\u20132 vote after GinaMarie was forced to break the tie.  Because this was also a double eviction week, the remaining HouseGuests went straight into the Head of Household competition, which McCrae won. McCrae (unaware that Andy was the one who had double crossed him and Amanda) nominated Elissa and GinaMarie shortly after. When Judd won the Power of Veto, he decided not to use it and Elissa was evicted in a unanimous 3\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Amanda and Elissa's eviction, the HouseGuests competed in the following Head of Household competition, which Spencer won. He nominated GinaMarie and McCrae. On Day 79, McCrae won the Power of Veto, his third Veto win of the season. On Day 81, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer chose to name Judd as the replacement nominee. On Day 82, Judd was evicted from the house for a second time in a 2\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Judd's second eviction, Andy won his second HoH of the season in the \"Before or After\" HoH competition. On Day 83, he nominated McCrae and Spencer for eviction. That same day, the HouseGuests competed in the final Veto competition of the season, titled \"Web of (F)Lies.\" Andy won the Power of Veto. On Day 84, Andy decided not to use the Power of Veto. Immediately following the Veto ceremony, GinaMarie, with the sole vote to evict, choose to evict McCrae from the game.\n\nFollowing McCrae's eviction, the final three participated in the first part of the final HoH competition, \"The Great E-skate,\" with GinaMarie being the victor. On Day 86, Spencer and Andy competed in part two of the final HoH competition, \"Crab Grab,\" which Andy won. During the finale, Andy and GinaMarie faced off in the final part of the competition, \"Jury Statements\". Andy won the competition and, as final HoH, cast the sole vote to evict Spencer from the house. After asking questions to the final two, the nine-person jury voted to crown the season's winner. Andy won in with a 7\u20132 vote, and Elissa won $25,000 as America's Favorite HouseGuest, with Judd and Howard gaining the next-highest number of votes.<ref name=\"THR_finale\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

For this competition, HouseGuests were put into a tournament-style bracket. The object was to roll a ball down a curved banana and have it land on top of the ice cream sundae. The first HouseGuest to get the ball on the sundae, moved on to the next round. Andy was the winner. Andy was also tasked with picking four HouseGuests as Have-Nots for the week and chose Aaryn, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen. On Day 50, Jessie and Spencer were nominated for eviction. Elissa, Amanda, and Helen were picked to play in the veto competition, while McCrae was selected to host. That same day, HouseGuests competed in the \"BBB Movie\" Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given a few minutes to study three movie sets. They were then asked questions about how many of a certain item there were in a set. If the HouseGuest was confident in their answer, they would \"stay\" for an attempt at winning a movie ticket. The housemate that was closest to the correct answer would receive a movie ticket, while the others were eliminated. If they were not confident they would \"fold\" and stay in the competition regardless of their answer. The first HouseGuest to obtain three movie tickets would be the winner. Andy was the winner. On Day 53, Andy chose not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 56, in a unanimous vote of 6\u20130, Jessie was evicted and became the third jury member.\n\nFollowing Jessie's eviction, Aaryn won her fourth Head of Household of the season in the \"Way Off Broadway\" HoH competition. Later that day, Julie Chen revealed to the audience that one of the four jury members would be coming back on the next weeks eviction night. On Day 57, the HouseGuests competed in the Have-Not competition, \"The Black Box\". In this competition, the HouseGuests had to enter a big, pitch-black box with many crawl spaces and gags, find the key, and exit the black box and hit a button to stop the timer. Amanda, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen were the Have-Nots for the week. Aaryn then chose to nominate Elissa and Helen, with Helen being her target. Andy, GinaMarie, and Spencer were selected to play in the Veto competition. On Day 58, Elissa went on to win her second Veto competition of the season. Elissa used the Veto to remove her nomination, and Aaryn nominated Spencer in her stead. On Day 63, Helen was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, with Elissa being the only one to vote for Spencer.\n\nShortly after Helen's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests and first four jurors competed in the \"Off the Wall\" competition, which functioned as both the HoH and re-entry competition. The HouseGuests and jurors were to stand on platforms and catch balls thrown at them without falling off. The first player overall to catch 10 balls or last to remain standing would be the new HoH, and the first juror to do so would return to the game. Judd was the last juror left standing and returned to the game as a HouseGuest, and Elissa was the first to catch 10 balls and became Head of Household. On Day 64, Elissa nominated Aaryn and McCrae for eviction. On Day 65, Amanda, GinaMarie, and Judd were selected to play in the Veto competition. Amanda won the Veto competition, her first individual competition win of the season. On Day 67, Amanda used the Power of Veto to save McCrae, causing Elissa to name Andy the replacement nominee. On Day 70, Aaryn was evicted by a vote of 5\u20130.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\">{{cite magazine|title = 'Big Brother 15': Latest Houseguest Evicted, Audience Gets Vocal|date = August 29, 2013|url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-brother-15-ninth-houseguest-617564|last = Ng|first = Philiana|magazine = The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Aaryn's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests began the \"Big Hopportunity\" competition. The HouseGuests were to hop to a wall made from chicken wire. There, each HouseGuest navigated their egg them through a maze formed by the letters \"HoH\" to a hole at the far side. They then had to hop back down and drop the egg in their basket. GinaMarie was the first HouseGuest with a dozen eggs and won the HoH. On the live show, Julie Chen also announced that the HouseGuests will compete in a special competition, and a live double eviction during Week 10.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\" /> On Day 71, GinaMarie chose to nominate Amanda and McCrae for eviction. On Day 72, Spencer, Andy, and Elissa were selected to play in the Veto competition. McCrae won the Veto competition. On Day 74, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer was once again named the replacement nominee. On Day 77, Amanda was evicted in a 3\u20132 vote after GinaMarie was forced to break the tie.  Because this was also a double eviction week, the remaining HouseGuests went straight into the Head of Household competition, which McCrae won. McCrae (unaware that Andy was the one who had double crossed him and Amanda) nominated Elissa and GinaMarie shortly after. When Judd won the Power of Veto, he decided not to use it and Elissa was evicted in a unanimous 3\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Amanda and Elissa's eviction, the HouseGuests competed in the following Head of Household competition, which Spencer won. He nominated GinaMarie and McCrae. On Day 79, McCrae won the Power of Veto, his third Veto win of the season. On Day 81, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer chose to name Judd as the replacement nominee. On Day 82, Judd was evicted from the house for a second time in a 2\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Judd's second eviction, Andy won his second HoH of the season in the \"Before or After\" HoH competition. On Day 83, he nominated McCrae and Spencer for eviction. That same day, the HouseGuests competed in the final Veto competition of the season, titled \"Web of (F)Lies.\" Andy won the Power of Veto. On Day 84, Andy decided not to use the Power of Veto. Immediately following the Veto ceremony, GinaMarie, with the sole vote to evict, choose to evict McCrae from the game.\n\nFollowing McCrae's eviction, the final three participated in the first part of the final HoH competition, \"The Great E-skate,\" with GinaMarie being the victor. On Day 86, Spencer and Andy competed in part two of the final HoH competition, \"Crab Grab,\" which Andy won. During the finale, Andy and GinaMarie faced off in the final part of the competition, \"Jury Statements\". Andy won the competition and, as final HoH, cast the sole vote to evict Spencer from the house. After asking questions to the final two, the nine-person jury voted to crown the season's winner. Andy won in with a 7\u20132 vote, and Elissa won $25,000 as America's Favorite HouseGuest, with Judd and Howard gaining the next-highest number of votes.<ref name=\"THR_finale\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

It was established as a social experiment and clearly that's what's happening this year. I find some of the behavior absolutely appalling personally. What you see there unfortunately is a reflection of how certain people feel in America. It's what our show is, I think we handled it properly. A lot of it makes us uncomfortable. I've watched every episode of the show, obviously [Julie Chen] would kill me if I didn't. So I do know what's going on there we do discuss it quite a bit. I think we are handling it quite appropriately. We did not comment on some of the racial things being said until it started affecting what was going on in the household. There was a lot of chatter about it on the Internet and I think we've handled it the way we should have.\"|sign=|source=}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/ CBS Official Site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100611020217/http://www.globaltv.com/BigBrother/index.html Global TV Official Site]\n*[http://bigbrothercasting.tv Official Casting Website]\n\n{{Big Brother US}}\n\n{{Coord|34|8|40.12|N|118|23|20.71|W|type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:2013 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:Big Brother (American TV series) seasons| 15]]\n", "name_user": "Eriru", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_15_(American_season)"}
