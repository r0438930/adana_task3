Krystyna, their second child, took after her father and his liking for riding horses, which she sat astride rather than [[side-saddle]] as was usual for women. She also became an expert skier during visits to [[Zakopane]] in the [[Tatra mountains]] of southern Poland.

The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she could. She began spending a great deal of time hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains.<ref>M.

They proved incompatible, and the marriage soon ended without rancour.

Her rescuer was Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, a brilliant, moody, irascible eccentric, who came from a wealthy family in [[Kamieniec Podolski]] (formerly Poland, at the time Soviet Union). At fourteen, he had quarrelled with his father, run away from home, and worked in the United States as a cowboy and gold prospector.

The British authorities showed little interest but were eventually convinced by Skarbek's acquaintances, including journalist [[Frederick Augustus Voigt]], who introduced her to the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS). The first SIS mention of her was in December 1939.  She was described as a \"flaming Polish patriot, expert skier, and great adventuress\" and \"absolutely fearless.\"{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=32-33}}<ref>M.

Hungary was not yet a participant in World War II, but was leaning toward Nazi Germany. Skarbek's cover story for her presence in Hungary was that she was a journalist.{{sfn|Walker|2014|page=80}}{{sfn|Mulley|2012|page=38}}  \n\nShe persuaded Polish Olympic skier [[Jan Marusarz]], brother of [[Nordic skiing|Nordic skier]] [[Stanis\u0142aw Marusarz]], to escort her across the snow-covered Tatra Mountains into Nazi-occupied Poland. Arriving in Warsaw, she pleaded vainly with her mother to leave Poland.<ref>M.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek encountered [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), now a Polish army officer, who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96\u201399</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\", and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\", a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski, a.k.a. Kennedy, drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]], where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attach\u00e9 [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] which they had received from a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]\". The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], in London, who could scarcely believe it; but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kowerski's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99\u2013107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gi\u017cycki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple's next destinations in the Opel were [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108\u2013118.</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.

When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> (The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946.) \n\nA week after the dismissal of Skarbek and Kowerski, on 22 June 1941 Germany began its [[Operation Barbarossa]] invasion of the [[Soviet Union]],  predicted by the intelligence the couple had passed along to the British from the Musketeers.<ref>M.

She turned down offers of office work and continued to be sidelined from the kind of dangerous and difficult work she desired.{{sfn|Mulley|2017|pages=134-148}} Both she and Kowerski continued to be under suspicion by the British and resented by the Polish government-in-exile because they worked for Britain.{{sfn|Walker|2014|page=82}}\n\n===Training===\nSkarbek's route back to active service with SOE began with her joining the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), an all-woman charity organization with military-style uniforms, that was used as a cover for many women in the SOE. The SOE officer who recruited her, Patrick Howarth, would later say jokingly that \"the most useful thing I did in World War II was to reinstate Christine Granville.\" Her briefing officer in FANY, Gwendolin Lees, was so impressed by Skarbek (now more commonly known as Granville) that she later named a daughter after her.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=148-149}} Despite Skarbek's experience in clandestine work, she was given SOE training for prospective agents. She proved to be a less than apt student at wireless transmitting (at which she was hopeless) and firearms (which she hated), but she loved parachuting.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=150-151, 168-176}}\n\nSOE's original plan to parachute Skarbek into Hungary was cancelled because the mission was deemed \"little short of homicide.\" The continued suspicions about her by the Polish government-in-exile precluded a return to Poland. Thus, SOE decided to infiltrate her into southern France. Her French was good and she took a course to improve her English. She moved to Algeria in preparation for a mission to France, but she was not immediately dispatched because SOE believed she was \"too flamboyant to work undercover effectively.\"{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=171-172}}\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] in August 1944.

Though most of the women in France answered to  F Section in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) The [[South of France]] was to be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed be supplied by their headquarters in [[Algiers]], not by London; and, (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French living in North Africa.<ref name=\"Foot\">{{cite book |last1=Foot |first1=M.

She became part of the [[SOE F Section networks#Jockey|Jockey]] network headed by [[Francis Cammaerts]], Belgian-British in nationality and a former pacifist.<ref name=\"Olson\">{{cite book |last1=Olson |first1=Lynne |title=Last Hope Island |date=2017|publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=9780812997361 |page=265}}</ref>  The job of Cammaerts and his team was to organize the French resistance fighters, the [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]], in southeastern France to weaken the German occupiers prior to the Allied invasion of southern France, Operation Dragoon, which would take place on 15 August. Skarbek was Cammaerts' courier, replacing [[Cecily Lefort]] who had been captured by the Germans and would be executed. She also had been given the task of attempting to subvert the Polish conscripts in the German army who were stationed along the Franco-Italian border.<ref name=\"Escott\">{{cite book |last1=Escott |first1=Beryl E. |title=The Heroines of SOE |date=2010 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |isbn=9780752487298 |pages=105-106}}</ref>\n\n'''Vercors Plateau.''' Cammaerts was based in the hamlet of [[Saint-Julien-en-Vercors]] on the remote [[Vercors Plateau]]. Skarbek arrived in the midst of a large operation headed by British major [[Desmond Longe]] of supplying by parachute the local maquis with arms and supplies. She was out every night when the moon was bright organizing a reception committee to collect the canisters dropped by Allied airplanes on the plateau. On the morning of 14 July came a daylight drop of light arms and supplies from 72 American [[B-17]]s, the largest single-day airdrop to the maquis during World War II. Encouraged by a speech from the head of the [[Provisional government of the French Republic|provisional government]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], (but discouraged by Cammaerts who opposed large-scale [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] operations and pleaded unsuccessfully for artillery and anti-tank weapons for the maquis), a full scale rebellion against the German occupiers broke out. The rebellion was premature and quickly crushed by German troops. On 22 July and under fire, Cammaerts and Skarbek escaped from the plateau, setting up a new base at [[Seyne-les-Alpes]].{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=191-220}}\n\n'''In the Alps.''' After the flight from the Vercos, Skarbek embarked on a journey of three weeks, mostly by foot (she despised bicycles), through the Alps.   She carried a rucksack filled with food and [[hand grenade]]s.  She made contact with two prominent leaders of the French Resistance, Gilbert Galletti and Paul H\u00e9rault (soon to be killed by the Germans), and greeted the arrival of an \"Operation Toplink\" team which included her friends John Roper, Paddy O'Regan, and Harvard Gunn. Their job was to organize and supply both the French and Italian resistance along the border. On 13 August, she subverted some of the Polish soldiers among the German units in the Alps. After a two-day hike to the [[Col de Larche]], a prominent mountain pass on the Franco-Italian border, she approached a formidable fortress, manned by 150 soldiers, at the head of the pass. Speaking in Polish and revealing her identity, she talked to the 63 Polish soldiers among the defenders, and told them, when the order was given by resistance forces, to desert and destroy the fortress, giving them specific instructions on how that was to be done. Six days later a small force of maquis and two Operation Toplink officers, John Roper and John Halsey, approached the garrison and the German commander surrendered the fortress and his mutinous soldiers. The Poles in the garrison joined the French resistance as Skarbek had told them to do.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=221-236}}\n\n'''Rescuing Cammaerts.''' On 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek rushed back from the Col de Larche, halting briefly along the way to meet a recently arrived 10-man military mission. She told them that, in Cammaerts' absence, she was in charge and arranged transportation for them. She also tried to persuade French resistance leaders to storm the prison in Digne and rescue Cammaerts and the others. She then put aside her aversion to bicycles, and cycled {{convert|40|km|mi}} to Digne.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=237-244}}   \n\nIn Digne on 15 August, Skarbek circled the walls of the prison humming \"[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie and Johnny]]\", a favourite tune of hers and Cammaerts. He responded in kind, confirming that he was within.{{snf|Mulley|2012|page=245}} Skarbek managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as Cammaerts' wife and a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\nSkarbek informed SOE in London and two million francs were air-dropped to her. On 17 August she was back in Schenck's office, money in hand. The Allied invasion of southern France had occurred on 15 August, and Allied soldiers were {{convert|60|km|mile}} distant and advancing rapidly toward Digne, a fact that was apparent to the Germans and their French collaborators. Schenck introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian, with the authority to order the release of the SOE agents. She met him in Schenck's apartment at four in the afternoon.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|page=246}} \n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}} \n\nThat evening, Cammaerts, Fielding, and Sorensen were marched out of the prison by Waem, dressed in his SS uniform.  They anticipated they were on the way to their execution, but instead Waem led them to an automobile and they were driven to the outskirts of Digne where Skarbek was waiting for them. She got into the automobile without a nod of recognition and they thought that she too was a prisoner.  They drove to the bank of a river where Fielding helped Waem bury his SS tunic. It was only then that he realized that they were being released, not executed.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=248-249}}   \n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value. Cammaerts and Skarbek helped her return to her home. Skarbek had promised Waem he would not be arrested by the British, and battled with SOE leaders with some success to protect him. He survived the war, and returned to Belgium.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=250-251}} \n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n'''Operation Dragoon.''' Digne was liberated by the American army two days after Skarbeks rescued Cammaerts, Fielding, and Sorensen.  The maquis had cleared the way for the Americans and there was little opposition.  Cammaerts and Skarbek met the American commander, Brigadier General [[Frederic B. Butler]], at [[Sisteron]] on 20 August. They offered their help but he dismissed them as \"bandits.\"  No respecter of rank, Skarbek was furious and had to be calmed down by an aide to the general. Leaving the American army behind, the two proceeded to [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]] where the maquis had captured the German garrison. There were several hundred Poles among the captured Germans. Skarbek addressed the Poles with a megaphone and secured their agreement to join the Allied forces, provided that they shed their German uniforms. The Poles stripped off their uniforms. General Butler arrived and disapproved of the proceedings, threatening Skarbek and Cammaerts with arrest and court martial if they didn't leave. Later, they had a better reception from Butler's superior officer, General [[Alexander Patch]], who appointed them as the liaison for the Americans with the maquis. The couple continued northward to [[Lyon]] and [[Paris]], and in September Skarbek went to London by air.{{sfn|Mulley|2010|pages=241-258}}\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nWhen the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle) in autumn 1944, some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], where the war with the [[Empire of Japan]] continued; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland. As the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. However, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF).

Krystyna, their second child, took after her father and his liking for riding horses, which she sat astride rather than [[side-saddle]] as was usual for women. She also became an expert skier during visits to [[Zakopane]] in the [[Tatra mountains]] of southern Poland. From the start, there was a complete rapport between father and daughter, who needed little encouragement to become a [[tomboy]].<ref>M.

The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she could. She began spending a great deal of time hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains.<ref>M.

They proved incompatible, and the marriage soon ended without rancour. A subsequent love affair came to naught when the young man's mother refused to consider the penniless divorc\u00e9e as a potential daughter-in-law.<ref>M.

Her rescuer was Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, a brilliant, moody, irascible eccentric, who came from a wealthy family in [[Kamieniec Podolski]] (formerly Poland, at the time Soviet Union). At fourteen, he had quarrelled with his father, run away from home, and worked in the United States as a cowboy and gold prospector.

The British authorities showed little interest but were eventually convinced by Skarbek's acquaintances, including journalist [[Frederick Augustus Voigt]], who introduced her to the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS). The first SIS mention of her was in December 1939.  She was described as a \"flaming Polish patriot, expert skier, and great adventuress\" and \"absolutely fearless.\"{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=32-33}}<ref>M.

Hungary was not yet a participant in World War II, but was leaning toward Nazi Germany. Skarbek's cover story for her presence in Hungary was that she was a journalist.{{sfn|Walker|2014|page=80}}{{sfn|Mulley|2012|page=38}}  \n\nShe persuaded Polish Olympic skier [[Jan Marusarz]], brother of [[Nordic skiing|Nordic skier]] [[Stanis\u0142aw Marusarz]], to escort her across the snow-covered Tatra Mountains into Nazi-occupied Poland. Arriving in Warsaw, she pleaded vainly with her mother to leave Poland.<ref>M.

In January 1942, Stefania was arrested by the Germans as a Jew and disappeared into Warsaw's [[Pawiak]] prison.<ref>Mulley, pp. 91\u201393</ref>  The prison had been designed in the mid-19th century by Skarbek's great-great-uncle [[Fryderyk Skarbek]], a prison reformer and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[godparent|godfather]], who had been tutored in French language by Chopin's father.<ref name=\"Chopin\">{{in lang|pl}} {{cite web|url=http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/persons/detail/id/2638|title=Fryderyk Skarbek|author=Piotr Mys\u0142akowski|author2=Andrzej Sikorski|date=April 2007|work=Fryderyk Chopin Information Centre|publisher=The Fryderyk Chopin Institute|location=Warsaw|language=Polish|accessdate=27 June 2014|quote=''W trosce o stan wi\u0119zie\u0144 zwr\u00f3ci\u0142 uwag\u0119 rz\u0105du na fatalne warunki istniej\u0105cego wi\u0119zienia \u015bledczego, tzw.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek encountered [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), now a Polish army officer, who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96\u201399</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\", and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\", a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski, a.k.a. Kennedy, drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]], where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attach\u00e9 [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] which they had received from a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]\". The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], in London, who could scarcely believe it; but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kowerski's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99\u2013107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gi\u017cycki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple's next destinations in the Opel were [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108\u2013118.</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M. Binney, ''The Women Who Lived for Danger'', pp. 71\u201372.</ref>|}}\n\nIn June 1941, [[Peter Wilkinson (diplomat)|Peter Wilkinson]] of SOE came to Cairo and officially dismissed Skarbek and Kowerski, although keeping them on the SOE payroll with a  small retainer that forced them to live in near poverty.{{sfn|Mulley|2017|pages=124-133}} Kowerski, who was under less suspicion than Skarbek, eventually cleared up any misunderstandings with General Kopa\u0144ski and was able to resume intelligence work. \n\nWhen Skarbek's husband, Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, was informed that Skarbek and Kowerski's services were being dispensed with, he took umbrage and abruptly bowed out of his own career as a British intelligence agent. When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> (The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946.) \n\nA week after the dismissal of Skarbek and Kowerski, on 22 June 1941 Germany began its [[Operation Barbarossa]] invasion of the [[Soviet Union]],  predicted by the intelligence the couple had passed along to the British from the Musketeers.<ref>M.

She turned down offers of office work and continued to be sidelined from the kind of dangerous and difficult work she desired.{{sfn|Mulley|2017|pages=134-148}} Both she and Kowerski continued to be under suspicion by the British and resented by the Polish government-in-exile because they worked for Britain.{{sfn|Walker|2014|page=82}}\n\n===Training===\nSkarbek's route back to active service with SOE began with her joining the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), an all-woman charity organization with military-style uniforms, that was used as a cover for many women in the SOE. The SOE officer who recruited her, Patrick Howarth, would later say jokingly that \"the most useful thing I did in World War II was to reinstate Christine Granville.\" Her briefing officer in FANY, Gwendolin Lees, was so impressed by Skarbek (now more commonly known as Granville) that she later named a daughter after her.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=148-149}} Despite Skarbek's experience in clandestine work, she was given SOE training for prospective agents. She proved to be a less than apt student at wireless transmitting (at which she was hopeless) and firearms (which she hated), but she loved parachuting.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=150-151, 168-176}}\n\nSOE's original plan to parachute Skarbek into Hungary was cancelled because the mission was deemed \"little short of homicide.\" The continued suspicions about her by the Polish government-in-exile precluded a return to Poland. Thus, SOE decided to infiltrate her into southern France. Her French was good and she took a course to improve her English. She moved to Algeria in preparation for a mission to France, but she was not immediately dispatched because SOE believed she was \"too flamboyant to work undercover effectively.\"{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=171-172}}\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] in August 1944.

Though most of the women in France answered to  F Section in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) The [[South of France]] was to be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed be supplied by their headquarters in [[Algiers]], not by London; and, (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French living in North Africa.<ref name=\"Foot\">{{cite book |last1=Foot |first1=M.

Skarbek was Cammaerts' courier, replacing [[Cecily Lefort]] who had been captured by the Germans and would be executed. She also had been given the task of attempting to subvert the Polish conscripts in the German army who were stationed along the Franco-Italian border.<ref name=\"Escott\">{{cite book |last1=Escott |first1=Beryl E. |title=The Heroines of SOE |date=2010 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |isbn=9780752487298 |pages=105-106}}</ref>\n\n'''Vercors Plateau.''' Cammaerts was based in the hamlet of [[Saint-Julien-en-Vercors]] on the remote [[Vercors Plateau]]. Skarbek arrived in the midst of a large operation headed by British major [[Desmond Longe]] of supplying by parachute the local maquis with arms and supplies. She was out every night when the moon was bright organizing a reception committee to collect the canisters dropped by Allied airplanes on the plateau. On the morning of 14 July came a daylight drop of light arms and supplies from 72 American [[B-17]]s, the largest single-day airdrop to the maquis during World War II. Encouraged by a speech from the head of the [[Provisional government of the French Republic|provisional government]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], (but discouraged by Cammaerts who opposed large-scale [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] operations and pleaded unsuccessfully for artillery and anti-tank weapons for the maquis), a full scale rebellion against the German occupiers broke out. The rebellion was premature and quickly crushed by German troops. On 22 July and under fire, Cammaerts and Skarbek escaped from the plateau, setting up a new base at [[Seyne-les-Alpes]].{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=191-220}}\n\n'''In the Alps.''' After the flight from the Vercos, Skarbek embarked on a journey of three weeks, mostly by foot (she despised bicycles), through the Alps.   She carried a rucksack filled with food and [[hand grenade]]s.  She made contact with two prominent leaders of the French Resistance, Gilbert Galletti and Paul H\u00e9rault (soon to be killed by the Germans), and greeted the arrival of an \"Operation Toplink\" team which included her friends John Roper, Paddy O'Regan, and Harvard Gunn. Their job was to organize and supply both the French and Italian resistance along the border. On 13 August, she subverted some of the Polish soldiers among the German units in the Alps. After a two-day hike to the [[Col de Larche]], a prominent mountain pass on the Franco-Italian border, she approached a formidable fortress, manned by 150 soldiers, at the head of the pass. Speaking in Polish and revealing her identity, she talked to the 63 Polish soldiers among the defenders, and told them, when the order was given by resistance forces, to desert and destroy the fortress, giving them specific instructions on how that was to be done. Six days later a small force of maquis and two Operation Toplink officers, John Roper and John Halsey, approached the garrison and the German commander surrendered the fortress and his mutinous soldiers. The Poles in the garrison joined the French resistance as Skarbek had told them to do.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=221-236}}\n\n'''Rescuing Cammaerts.''' On 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek rushed back from the Col de Larche, halting briefly along the way to meet a recently arrived 10-man military mission. She told them that, in Cammaerts' absence, she was in charge and arranged transportation for them. She also tried to persuade French resistance leaders to storm the prison in Digne and rescue Cammaerts and the others. She then put aside her aversion to bicycles, and cycled {{convert|40|km|mi}} to Digne.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=237-244}}   \n\nIn Digne on 15 August, Skarbek circled the walls of the prison humming \"[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie and Johnny]]\", a favourite tune of hers and Cammaerts. He responded in kind, confirming that he was within.{{snf|Mulley|2012|page=245}} Skarbek managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as Cammaerts' wife and a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\nSkarbek informed SOE in London and two million francs were air-dropped to her. On 17 August she was back in Schenck's office, money in hand. The Allied invasion of southern France had occurred on 15 August, and Allied soldiers were {{convert|60|km|mile}} distant and advancing rapidly toward Digne, a fact that was apparent to the Germans and their French collaborators. Schenck introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian, with the authority to order the release of the SOE agents. She met him in Schenck's apartment at four in the afternoon.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|page=246}} \n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}} \n\nThat evening, Cammaerts, Fielding, and Sorensen were marched out of the prison by Waem, dressed in his SS uniform.  They anticipated they were on the way to their execution, but instead Waem led them to an automobile and they were driven to the outskirts of Digne where Skarbek was waiting for them. She got into the automobile without a nod of recognition and they thought that she too was a prisoner.  They drove to the bank of a river where Fielding helped Waem bury his SS tunic. It was only then that he realized that they were being released, not executed.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=248-249}}   \n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value. Cammaerts and Skarbek helped her return to her home. Skarbek had promised Waem he would not be arrested by the British, and battled with SOE leaders with some success to protect him. He survived the war, and returned to Belgium.{{sfn|Mulley|2012|pages=250-251}} \n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n'''Operation Dragoon.''' Digne was liberated by the American army two days after Skarbeks rescued Cammaerts, Fielding, and Sorensen.  The maquis had cleared the way for the Americans and there was little opposition.  Cammaerts and Skarbek met the American commander, Brigadier General [[Frederic B. Butler]], at [[Sisteron]] on 20 August. They offered their help but he dismissed them as \"bandits.\"  No respecter of rank, Skarbek was furious and had to be calmed down by an aide to the general. Leaving the American army behind, the two proceeded to [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]] where the maquis had captured the German garrison. There were several hundred Poles among the captured Germans. Skarbek addressed the Poles with a megaphone and secured their agreement to join the Allied forces, provided that they shed their German uniforms. The Poles stripped off their uniforms. General Butler arrived and disapproved of the proceedings, threatening Skarbek and Cammaerts with arrest and court martial if they didn't leave. Later, they had a better reception from Butler's superior officer, General [[Alexander Patch]], who appointed them as the liaison for the Americans with the maquis. The couple continued northward to [[Lyon]] and [[Paris]], and in September Skarbek went to London by air.{{sfn|Mulley|2010|pages=241-258}}\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nWhen the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle) in autumn 1944, some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], where the war with the [[Empire of Japan]] continued; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland. As the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. However, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF).
