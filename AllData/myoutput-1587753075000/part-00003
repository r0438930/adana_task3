Jennings, Jr. <i> The Man Jesus Loved</i> (2003)</ref> \n\n===The Naked Youth===\n\nThe Gospel of Mark (14:51\u201352), describes how in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], \"A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they [the Temple guards] seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.\"\n\nThe text of the [[naked youth]] is puzzling for some authors; moreover, the text only appears in Mark, which has led some commentators to allege that Mark was describing himself as the youth.<ref>Robert J.

This has been linked to the views of an ancient group called the [[Carpocrates|Carpocratians]]. Some modern commentators interpret it as a baptism, others as some form of sexual initiation, and others as an [[allegory]] for a non-sexual initiation into a [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] sect.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Miller |title=The Complete Gospels: annotated Scholars Version |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |year=1994 |page=[https://archive.org/details/completegospels00robe/page/411 411] |isbn=9780060655877 |url=https://archive.org/details/completegospels00robe/page/411 }}</ref> However, the authorship of \"Secret Mark\" is still a matter of debate.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\">Pheme Perkins, [https://books.google.it/books?id=GZOtAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA663 \"Apocryphal Gospels and the Historical Jesus\"], in [[James H.

Several [[theologians]] and Bible commentators have interpreted this passage as indicating Jesus's support for [[celibacy]].<ref group=note>In the ancient Middle East and Asia, eunuchs often served as officials overseeing harems, or in other Royal positions. See <span class=\"plainlinks\">[http://lexicorient.com/e.o/eunuch.htm Encyclopaedia of the Orient]</span> for more details.</ref>\n\nThe early Christian writer [[Origen]] interpreted Jesus' words literally and so physically castrated himself as an act of devotion.<ref>J. David Hester (2005). ''Eunuchs and the Postgender Jesus: Matthew 19:12 and Transgressive Sexualities''.

The apostle [Paul] also, following His example, made himself a eunuch...\"</ref> likewise encouraged people to adopt this practice.<ref>Tertullian, Adversus Marcionem i.29.</ref>\n\n===Bride of Christ===\n\nThe [[Bride of Christ]] is a [[metaphor]] for the [[Ecclesia (church)|Ecclesia]], likening the relationship between [[Christians]] and [[Jesus]] to a [[betrothal]] pointing to a future wedding, when Christians are re-united with Jesus. In the [[Gospel of John]] (<span class=\"plainlinks\">{{bibleverse-nb||John|3:22\u201336}}</span>), [[John the Baptist]] speaks in terms of himself as a \"[[best man]]\" with the implication that Christ the bridegroom (see also [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] <span class=\"plainlinks\">{{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|9:15}}</span>) is coming to meet his bride, although there is nothing specific to identify the bride.
