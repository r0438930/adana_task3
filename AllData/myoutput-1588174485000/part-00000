She is best known for her groundbreaking comedy variety show, ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', originally aired on [[CBS]]. It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects. Her film roles include ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1974), ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992), and ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). On television, she has appeared in other sketch shows; in dramatic roles in ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]'' (1974) and ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]'' (1979); in various well-regarded guest roles, such as in ''[[Mad About You]],'' for which she won an Emmy Award; and in specials with [[Julie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Beverly Sills]], and others. She returned to the Broadway stage in 1995 in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]],'' for which she was again nominated for a [[Tony Award]].\n\nBurnett has written and narrated several [[memoir]]s, earning [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations for almost all of them, and a win for ''[[In Such Good Company|In Such Good Company: Eleven Years Of Laughter, Mayhem, And Fun In The Sandbox]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/carol-burnett|title=Artist Carol Burnett|website=www.grammy.com|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-grammys-2017-nominations-winners-list-20161205-story.html |title=2017 Grammy Awards: Complete list of nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 12, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n  \nIn 2005, she was recognized as \"one of America's most cherished entertainers\" and awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] \"for enhancing the lives of millions of Americans and for her extraordinary contributions to American entertainment.\"<ref>{{cite press release|date=November 9, 2005 |title= Citations for Recipients of the 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051109-10.html|location=Washington, DC|publisher=The White House|agency= Office of the Press Secretary|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref> In 2013, Burnett was awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] at the [[John F.

During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience).

They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and this opened doors for several of the girls. She was cast in a minor role on ''The [[Paul Winchell]] and Jerry Mahoney Show'' in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist's dummy on the popular children's program. This role led to her starring role opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' from 1956-57.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Carol burnett garry moore 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Burnett and Larry Blyden from ''The Garry Moore Show'', 1960]]\nAfter ''Stanley'', Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called \"I Made a Fool of Myself Over [[John Foster Dulles]]\" (Dulles was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] at the time). In 1957, she performed this number on both ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', hosted by [[Jack Paar]], and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Dulles was asked about her on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' and joked,  \u201cI never discuss matters of the heart in public.\u201d<ref name=MTprize/>\n\nShe also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows, ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]'', during this time.

She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who later became her signature alter-ego.

Among other things, it parodied films (''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), television (''[[As the Stomach Turns]]'' for the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and commercials. Musical numbers were also a frequent feature. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", which eventually was spun off into its own television show called ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring [[Vicki Lawrence]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nShe opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib.

This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her; during the show's run, her grandmother died. On an ''[[Intimate Portrait]]'' episode on Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmother's last moments: \"She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed 'Joe, you see that spider up there?' There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said 'Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!!' And then she died. There's laughter in everything!\"<ref>[[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Channel]]'s ''Intimate Portrait'' episode on Burnett</ref> She continued the tradition of tugging her ear. The show ceased production in 1978. Four post-script episodes were produced and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the summer of 1979 under the title, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' basically using the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of her series were edited into half-hour episodes for syndication entitled ''Carol Burnett and Friends'', which, for many years, proved to be extremely popular in syndication, and in January 2015, it began airing on [[MeTV]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe show's enduring popularity surprised many when a 2001 retrospective containing outtakes and discussions with the cast, and a tribute to [[Bob Mackie]], drew in 30 million viewers, topping the Emmy Awards as well as all but the final game of that year's [[World Series]].<ref name= \"Heartbreak\"/> Her Grammy-winning memoir ''In Such Good Company'' is about the show, and Burnett tells about how it was developed, with anecdotes about improvisations, the cast, crew, and guests.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s: Film roles===\n[[File:Carol Burnett - 1974.jpg|right|thumb|Burnett in 1974]]\nBurnett starred in a few films while her variety show was running, including ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972). She was nominated for an Emmy in 1974 for her role in the drama ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]''. After her show ended, she assumed a number of roles that departed from comedy. She appeared in several dramatic roles, most notably in the television movie ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]''. She appeared as Beatrice O'Reilly in the film ''Life of The Party: The Story of Beatrice'', a story about a woman fighting her alcoholism. Her other film work includes [[Alan Alda]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), [[John Huston]]'s ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), and [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992). \n\n''Voice Roles'''\nIn 2008, she had her second role as an animated character in the film ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]''. Her first was in ''[[The Trumpet of the Swan (film)|The Trumpet of the Swan]]'' in 2001.

In 1974, she appeared at [[the Muny]] Theatre in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'' with [[Rock Hudson]], and eleven years later, she took the supporting role of Carlotta Campion in the 1985 concert performance of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]''. She made frequent appearances as a panelist on the game show ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', an association she maintained until the early 1980s (in fact, [[Mark Goodson]] awarded her his Silver Password All-Stars Award for best celebrity player; she's also credited with coming up with the title ''[[Password Plus]]'', when it was originally planned to be titled ''Password '79'').\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, she made several attempts at starting a new variety program. She also appeared briefly on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches spinoff, ''[[Mama's Family]]'', as her stormy character, [[Eunice Higgins]]. She played the matriarch in the [[cult following|cult]] comedy miniseries ''[[Fresno (TV miniseries)|Fresno]]'', which parodied the primetime soap opera ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. She returned to TV in the mid-1990s as a supporting character on the sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]'', playing Theresa Stemple, the mother of main character Jamie Buchman ([[Helen Hunt]]), for which she won another Emmy Award. In 1995, after an absence of 30 years, she was back on Broadway in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. Four years later, she appeared in the Broadway revue ''[[Putting It Together]]''. In 2014, Burnett joined two-time Tony Award Winner, Brian Dennehy, on Broadway in A. R. Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc'''\n{{main|Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor. The charwoman is shown mopping the floor in the porn shop, and the characters subsequently discuss Burnett's ear tug and make a crude comment about it. Burnett and her company requested that Fox remove all references to her, the theme and the character but the studio did not.<ref name=\"Reut20th\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-burnett/carol-burnett-sues-tvs-family-guy-cartoon-idUSN1624604020070317 |title=Carol Burnett sues TV's \"Family Guy\" cartoon |work=[[Reuters]] |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Gun20th\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/carol-burnett-v-family-guy |title=Carol Burnett v. \"Family Guy\" Comedian sues over porn shop spoof of beloved charwoman character |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date=March 16, 2018 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> The suit was ruled in favor of the defendant because the bit was a parody, which is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects.

Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor.
