However, he did not take to the work and within two years had run away to sea. He joined a small sailing coaster on the Tees and his early career was spent trading with northern Scottish ports down to South Wales and later the near Continent.\n\nHe settled in [[Stockton-on-Tees]] in the North East of England and in 1862 married Margaret Dobson. It was while living here that he first established a shipbuilding company on the south bank of the Tees while at the same time continuing to work as a captain. The couple produced seven children and moved to Hull in 1883 where Robert continued his business.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nRobert was joined in the business by his three sons, John Robert (Bob), Ernest Bertie (Bert) and Herbert Dobson (Herbie), and continued to expand his fleet with the addition of several steamers. In 1908 he came ashore to manage the business from the office.\n\n===1914\u20131918===\n\nDue to an increased demand for freight tonnage during the [[World War I|Great War]], Robert Rix & Sons increased revenue and profit throughout the period and invested in a ship building programme to modernise its fleet. The company also offloaded a number of older steamers which were fetching higher prices than in peacetime. In 1916 and 1917 Robert Rix & Sons took delivery of two pairs of [[steamships]] from Cochrane & Sons Ltd in [[Selby]], which for the first time bore the family name. These were the Magrix, the Robrix, and Jarrix and the Ebbrix and they set the precedent by which all Rix ships would be named from then on.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n===1920s \u2013 1950s===\n\nThe early 1920s were a difficult period for ship owners due to the depressed economic conditions and the increasing popularity of [[rail freight]], but Robert Rix & Sons continued to grow its fleet with the addition of six ships, many of which were used to work the east coast coal trading routes.\n\nIn November 1925 Robert Rix died following a cerebral haemorrhage, aged 84. He had worked right up to his death, leaving the office the day before along with the rest of the staff.\n\nIn 1927 the roots of the largest company in the J.R. Rix & Sons group, Rix Petroleum Ltd, were established when Robert Rix & Sons began importing tractor vaporising oil to the UK to fuel the post-war agricultural revolution. The company also carried lamp oil from Russia to the Humber on Rix ships. This led to such an expansion that by 1939 the company owned 11 ships spread across four companies.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n===1939 \u2013 1947===\n\nFreight rates increased again before the [[Second World War]] which meant the value of elderly steam coasters rose and Robert Rix & Sons sold a number of vessels. The company also lost two ships during the war; one, the Malrix hit a mine off [[Southend]] in December 1940 and the Pegrix sank off the [[Norfolk]] coast after colliding with Coast Line\u2019s [[Normandy]] Coast.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe company helped the war effort directly in several ways. The Ebbrix was taken for special duties on the east coast of [[Scotland]] as part of the invasion of [[Europe]] and Kenrix\u2019s master, Capt. George Simison, was awarded the Atlantic Star medal for his participation in the Normandy Landings.\n\nDuring the [[war]] years the shipping companies were run by Robert Kenneth Rix (Ken) and the petroleum business by John Leslie Rix (Les), both sons of Bob Rix. After the war, however, Malcolm and Geoffrey Rix, sons of Bert and Herbie respectively, both expressed an interest in joining the firm.\n\nBob felt the company was not big enough to support the extra family members and it was finally decided that the partnership should be dissolved. Bert and Herbie became equal partners in Robert Rix & Sons and Bob, Ken and Les left to establish J.R. Rix & Sons.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nJ.R. Rix & Sons started life on January 1947 with a working capital of \u00a37,000 and one motor ship, the Magrix, in offices in the [[Bank of England]] Chambers, Whitefriargate, Hull, but did not become a [[limited company]] until 14 February 1957. In the meantime, several Rix companies still in existence today were established including Rix Shipping Co Ltd (Rix Shipping), formed in March 1950, and Rix Shipping (Scotland) Ltd, formerly Piggins Rix Ltd, based in Montrose, Scotland.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nPiggins Rix Ltd grew out of Rix Limes Ltd which had been established to supply [[limestone]] mined in quarries in the East Riding of Yorkshire to the Scottish agricultural market. The lime was transported by sea from Hull to Montrose on Rix ships where it was discharged by J.M. Piggins Ltd. J.R. Rix & Sons bought the company \u2013 its first owned interest in Scotland \u2013 and renamed it Piggins Rix Ltd. A short time later Rix Petroleum established a fuel depot there to serve the offshore industry and its growing domestic, [[agricultural]] and [[haulage]] customers.\n\nPiggins Rix Ltd was renamed Rix Shipping (Scotland) Ltd in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//compdetails |title=Companies House WebCheck |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Rix Shipping Ltd==\n\nRix Shipping was formed on 23 March 1950, making it is the oldest company in the J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd group, however it did not become a limited company until 14 February 1957. It started out with a single ship, Magrix (2) but the company soon acquired two further vessels: Roxton, from [[Middlesbrough]] owners, and a ship bought from [[Sweden|Swedish]] owners which the company renamed as the Jarrix (2).\n\nRix Shipping Ltd established regular voyages for [[coal]] from [[Amble]], [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] and [[Goole]] for [[Teignmouth]], [[Exmouth]], [[Hayle]], [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and [[Penzance]], with back cargoes of [[china clay]] and stone chippings. Another regular cargo was sulphate of [[ammonia]] from the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] or [[River Tees|Tees]] bound for [[Ipswich]] and [[Avonmouth]] and in 1958 Rix Shipping Ltd began carrying agricultural limestone from [[Whitby]] to North Eastern Scottish ports as well as [[chalk]], mined from [[Little Weighton]] in the East Riding of Yorkshire, from Hull.\n\nOver the years the company continued to expand its fleet by both buying ships and commissioning new vessels to be built until by the early sixties it had four motor ships all under five years old. This enabled the business to trade with near continental ports as well as those in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] and [[Bay of Biscay]]. Regular return cargoes included seasonal crops, including French onion sellers who, complete with bikes, were carried in the ship\u2019s hold with the onions.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nToday Rix Shipping Ltd is based at the head office of parent firm, J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd, in Spyvee Street, Hull, and owns and operates a fleet of estuarial tank barges, coastal tankers and high speed crew transfer workboats. Its main business activities include carriage of petroleum products, carriage of engineers to maintain wind turbines and stevedoring services through Hull's [[Port of Hull|King George Dock]] and Montrose in Scotland.\n\nRix Shipping Ltd also owns 25 acres of secure storage and warehousing space close to King George Dock in the east of the city and significant areas of land and warehousing in Montrose.\n\n==Rix Petroleum Ltd==\n\nRix Petroleum Ltd is the largest subsidiary of J.R.

The war years saw the business expand and supply commercial diesel customers in the East Riding of Yorkshire and the road transport industry. Domestic customers also provided an opportunity for the business as many households converted to cheaper, oil-fired central heating and the agricultural sector opened up as farmers turned from horses to tractors.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe company was incorporated in June 1956 operates a fleet of more than 100 tankers in the UK serving agriculture and agribusiness, hauliers and other fleet-vehicle operators and the residential [[Fuel oil|heating oil]] market customers.\n\nIts red, white and blue logo has remained relatively unchanged for many decades and is a common site on tankers, particularly around [[Yorkshire]], but also in other regions where the business operates.\n\n==Maritime Bunkering Ltd==\n\nThe demand for marine fuel also spawned another Rix company, Maritime Bunkering Ltd, which supplies marine fuels to vessels on the [[Humber Estuary]].\n\n==Jordan & Co (Hull) Ltd==\n\nJordan & Co (Hull) Ltd is a car dealership based in Witham, close to central Hull that is well known locally as a Rix-owned business. The business was established in the early 1900s as a [[bicycle]] retailer based on High Street in Hull City Centre. In the 1920s it progressed to selling [[motorcycles]] and in the 1950s became a car retailer.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the roots of the modern day business were laid down after Rix Petroleum acquired the Jubilee filling station on Holderness Road in the city, which was also the site of a BMC car dealership. The location became the site of Jordans & Co (Hull) Ltd, where it remains to this day. Over time BMC vehicles lost out to more reliable Japanese brands and therefore the company began selling Datsun, which later became Nissan.\n\nJordans, as it is known locally, was recently the subject of a \u00a3300,000 investment in its showroom facilities to become the UK\u2019s first ever [[Fiat]] \"super centre\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Hull-car-dealership-Jordans-undergoing-pound-300k/story-16478972-detail/story.html#axzz2Lu4RAQMD |title=Hull car dealership Jordans undergoing \u00a3300k refit |work= Hull Daily Mail |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Hepworth Shipyard Ltd==\n\nIn 1977 J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd bought the [[Paull]]-based shipbuilder J.R. Hepworth & Co (Hull) Ltd and a formed new company, Hepworth Shipyard Ltd, which built small craft such as [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]] and [[tugs]] at its location on the north bank of the Humber. The yard successfully continued shipbuilding until 2012 and was for many years the last remaining shipbuilder on the Humber as all other yards had turned to repairs only. But after completing the 53m long Lerrix for Rix Shipping Ltd early last year, the company was closed and the premises was let to Dunston (Shipbuilders) Ltd, a new business dedicated to making [[aluminium]] boats for the wind farm industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Launch-help-economy-power/story-16226227-detail/story.html#axzz2Lu4RAQMD |title=Launch to help our economy power up |work=Hull Daily Mail  |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Fuelmate Ltd==\n\nAlong with its core services of supplying commercial [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and residential heating oil, Rix Petroleum also provided UK fuel cards to help its customers manage their fuel costs effectively.

Domestic customers also provided an opportunity for the business as many households converted to cheaper, oil-fired central heating and the agricultural sector opened up as farmers turned from horses to tractors.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe company was incorporated in June 1956 operates a fleet of more than 100 tankers in the UK serving agriculture and agribusiness, hauliers and other fleet-vehicle operators and the residential [[Fuel oil|heating oil]] market customers.\n\nIts red, white and blue logo has remained relatively unchanged for many decades and is a common site on tankers, particularly around [[Yorkshire]], but also in other regions where the business operates.\n\n==Maritime Bunkering Ltd==\n\nThe demand for marine fuel also spawned another Rix company, Maritime Bunkering Ltd, which supplies marine fuels to vessels on the [[Humber Estuary]].\n\n==Jordan & Co (Hull) Ltd==\n\nJordan & Co (Hull) Ltd is a car dealership based in Witham, close to central Hull that is well known locally as a Rix-owned business. The business was established in the early 1900s as a [[bicycle]] retailer based on High Street in Hull City Centre. In the 1920s it progressed to selling [[motorcycles]] and in the 1950s became a car retailer.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the roots of the modern day business were laid down after Rix Petroleum acquired the Jubilee filling station on Holderness Road in the city, which was also the site of a BMC car dealership. The location became the site of Jordans & Co (Hull) Ltd, where it remains to this day. Over time BMC vehicles lost out to more reliable Japanese brands and therefore the company began selling Datsun, which later became Nissan.\n\nJordans, as it is known locally, was recently the subject of a \u00a3300,000 investment in its showroom facilities to become the UK\u2019s first ever [[Fiat]] \"super centre\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Hull-car-dealership-Jordans-undergoing-pound-300k/story-16478972-detail/story.html#axzz2Lu4RAQMD |title=Hull car dealership Jordans undergoing \u00a3300k refit |work= Hull Daily Mail |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Hepworth Shipyard Ltd==\n\nIn 1977 J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd bought the [[Paull]]-based shipbuilder J.R. Hepworth & Co (Hull) Ltd and a formed new company, Hepworth Shipyard Ltd, which built small craft such as [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]] and [[tugs]] at its location on the north bank of the Humber. The yard successfully continued shipbuilding until 2012 and was for many years the last remaining shipbuilder on the Humber as all other yards had turned to repairs only. But after completing the 53m long Lerrix for Rix Shipping Ltd early last year, the company was closed and the premises was let to Dunston (Shipbuilders) Ltd, a new business dedicated to making [[aluminium]] boats for the wind farm industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Launch-help-economy-power/story-16226227-detail/story.html#axzz2Lu4RAQMD |title=Launch to help our economy power up |work=Hull Daily Mail  |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Fuelmate Ltd==\n\nAlong with its core services of supplying commercial [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and residential heating oil, Rix Petroleum also provided UK fuel cards to help its customers manage their fuel costs effectively.
