Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups.\" Former fast-bowler [[Michael Holding]] argued \"if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket.\"<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/355276.html The shots that rang around the world], 2008-06-16, Cricinfo.

By scoring a century in the second of two Tests, not only did he move to 20 centuries for England, but he levelled the series at 1\u20131, ensuring England retain their No.1 Test Ranking status.

Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups.\" Former fast-bowler [[Michael Holding]] argued \"if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket.\"<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/355276.html The shots that rang around the world], 2008-06-16, Cricinfo.
