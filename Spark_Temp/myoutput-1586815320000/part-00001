It is the second largest stadium in [[Denmark]]. Built in 1965 and inaugurated on 31 June 1966 where it had no stands, it saw a major redevelopment in 2000 which increased capacity to 31,500 spectators, of which 19,700 were seated. Continuous adjustments to the spectator facilities have since resulted in the stadium having a total capacity of 28,000 spectators, of which 23,400 are seated. Record attendance dates to 18 June 2003, where a crowd of 31,508 were present in a [[Copenhagen Derby]] against [[F.C.

Each stand has two tiers.\n\n=== Sydsiden (South End) ===\nSydsiden, literally \"South Side\" in English, was inaugurated as the new South Stand on 29 March 1992 in a match against [[Lyngby Boldklub]], due to a rise in interest for Br\u00f8ndby IF.<ref name=\"FiB07\"/><ref name=Sydsiden2>{{cite web |url=https://sydsiden.brondby.com/ |title=Sydsiden 25 \u00e5r |date=15 March 2017 |publisher=Br\u00f8ndby IF |accessdate=15 March}}</ref> The lower part of the stand has a standing capacity of 5,600 spectators.

This had to change as there was a conflict of interest as [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] moved in as new sponsors. Sydsiden was chosen by a panel representing a broad section of the active fan base at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion, as fans had called the stand this before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2011/01/18/faxe-tribunen-bliver-til-sydsiden |title=Faxe-tribunen bliver til Sydsiden |date=18 January 2011 |publisher=Br\u00f8ndby IF |accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> Halfway through the 2017\u201318 season, the hole in the middle of the stand was partly closed, after continuous requests by fans.<ref name=\"VaerMed\"/>\n\nA permanent fanzone was inaugurated outside Sydsiden in 2018 for spectators and fans before, during and after the games. The fanzone is the first of its kind in Scandinavia, and consists of stands for live concerts, bars, foodstands and toilet facilities.\n\nSydsiden popularised the \"Fenerbah\u00e7e greeting\" in Denmark, imported through the transfer of [[Brian Steen Nielsen]] to the Turkish club. A cooperation between goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF#Support|Br\u00f8ndby Support]] effectually made the greeting get foothold in Denmark.<ref name=Sydsiden/>\n\n=== North End ===\nThe North Stand, now known as \"J. Jensen-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was originally known as \"da:OBS!-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1992 as terracing, and has among fans been known as \"P\u00f8lseenden\" ({{lang-da|[[:da:Rosinen i p\u00f8lseenden|the sausage end]]}}) due to its former major sponsor, sausage producer Steff-Houlberg. Fans from the away team are assigned a section on this stand, usually in the eastern part of the North Stand, separated from Br\u00f8ndby's home fans.\n\n=== West Stand ===\nThe West Stand, known as \"[[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]-tribunen\", was originally named \"Frisko-tribunen and later also \"SAS-tribunen\" and \"Apollo-tribunen\". The original part of the stand was completed in 1979 as the first stand of the stadium, and it has been preserved through the large expansion in 1999\u20132000. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites, and is the ground's main grandstand.\n\n=== East Stand ===\nThe East Stand, now known as \"GSV-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was formerly called \"LOXAM-tribunen\", \"[[Codan]]-tribunen and \"DNE-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1982 and 1990. The East Stand was originally without a roof, and consisted of terraces. Today, it is the largest stand of Br\u00f8ndby Stadion with a total of 34 rows of seats. In 2006, a larger extension was established behind the stand from the facade, consisting of sponsor facilities, a sports bar and classrooms for Br\u00f8ndby Gymnasium. The classrooms were inaugurated on 8 January 2007. In April 2018, a new family lounge was opened behind the East Stand with both physical and Esports facilities.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe easiest way of getting to the stadium with public transport is with the [[S-tog]] or S-train. Line B (green) will stop at both Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster and Glostrup stations, where there are shuttle buses on match days. One can also walk from the stations, with the walk taking 15 minutes from Glostrup, and slightly longer from Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster.\n\n==National games==\nBr\u00f8ndby Stadion has been used five times as home ground for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]].

It is the second largest stadium in [[Denmark]]. Built in 1965 and inaugurated on 31 June 1966 where it had no stands, it saw a major redevelopment in 2000 which increased capacity to 31,500 spectators, of which 19,700 were seated. Continuous adjustments to the spectator facilities have since resulted in the stadium having a total capacity of 28,000 spectators, of which 23,400 are seated. Record attendance dates to 18 June 2003, where a crowd of 31,508 were present in a [[Copenhagen Derby]] against [[F.C. Copenhagen]].\n\nWhen hosting the [[UEFA]] competitions [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], seats are installed on the South End [[Terrace (stadium)|terraces]] ({{lang-da|Sydsiden}}) in accordance with UEFA regulations, which reduces the total capacity to 26,000.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted the [[Denmark national football team]] in five matches. Their first game at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion was a [[exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] on 1 September 2006 which ended in a 4\u20132 win.\n\n== History ==\n=== Turning idea into product ===\nThe idea of constructing a centrally located, municipal sports facility was presented by erstwhile mayor [[Jens Christian Jensen (mayor)|Jens Christian Jensen]] in 1945,<ref name=\"Barnak27\">Barnak 2007, p. 27.</ref> but at the time the sports clubs of the municipality could not agree on a common stadium.<ref name=\"Barnak27\"/> \n\nWhen a merger of the municipality's three largest sports clubs was considered in the 1950s, much suggests that these plans were fostered on a political as well as executive level.<ref name=\"Barnak27\"/> Having only one club in the municipality would enable a more rational use of a future Br\u00f8ndby Stadion.<ref name=\"Barnak27\"/> The idea of a merger gained support in [[Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster Idr\u00e6tsforening]], and at the general assembly in 1962 a majority of the board voted their approval of merging [[:da:Br\u00f8ndbyvester Idr\u00e6tsforening|Br\u00f8ndbyvester Idr\u00e6tsforening]] and [[:da:Br\u00f8ndby Strands Idr\u00e6tsklub|Br\u00f8ndby Strands Idr\u00e6tsforeninger]].<ref name=\"Barnak28\"/> The latter, however, immediately disapproved of the idea, while a vote in Br\u00f8ndbyvester ended up with the same result: a 'no' to merging into a municipal superstructure.<ref name=\"Barnak28\">Barnak 2007, p. 28.</ref>\n\nOnly a few years would pass before plans of merging Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster Idr\u00e6tsforening and Br\u00f8ndbyvester Idr\u00e6tsforening would resurface.<ref name=\"Barnak28\"/> Financial benefit was one of the main arguments for uniting the two clubs in order to play at a future municipal stadium,<ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg\">{{cite news |author= |title=Stadion till\u00e6g |publisher=Br\u00f8ndby IF |pages= 2 |date=22 October 2000 }}</ref> and mayor of [[Br\u00f8ndby Municipality|Br\u00f8ndby]] in the period 1966\u20132005, as well as chairman of [[Br\u00f8ndby IF]] board in 1971\u201371, [[Kjeld Rasmussen]], has since stated that he and Br\u00f8ndby's mayor at the time had decided to construct a stadium, provided that the two clubs would merge.<ref name=\"Barnak61\">Barnak 2007, p. 61.</ref> {{quotation|The closer we came to a completion of Br\u00f8ndby Stadion, the stronger grew the support of forming one big club.

This had to change as there was a conflict of interest as [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] moved in as new sponsors. Sydsiden was chosen by a panel representing a broad section of the active fan base at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion, as fans had called the stand this before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2011/01/18/faxe-tribunen-bliver-til-sydsiden |title=Faxe-tribunen bliver til Sydsiden |date=18 January 2011 |publisher=Br\u00f8ndby IF |accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> Halfway through the 2017\u201318 season, the hole in the middle of the stand was partly closed, after continuous requests by fans.<ref name=\"VaerMed\"/>\n\nA permanent fanzone was inaugurated outside Sydsiden in 2018 for spectators and fans before, during and after the games. The fanzone is the first of its kind in Scandinavia, and consists of stands for live concerts, bars, foodstands and toilet facilities.\n\nSydsiden popularised the \"Fenerbah\u00e7e greeting\" in Denmark, imported through the transfer of [[Brian Steen Nielsen]] to the Turkish club. A cooperation between goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF#Support|Br\u00f8ndby Support]] effectually made the greeting get foothold in Denmark.<ref name=Sydsiden/>\n\n=== North End ===\nThe North Stand, now known as \"J. Jensen-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was originally known as \"da:OBS!-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1992 as terracing, and has among fans been known as \"P\u00f8lseenden\" ({{lang-da|[[:da:Rosinen i p\u00f8lseenden|the sausage end]]}}) due to its former major sponsor, sausage producer Steff-Houlberg. Fans from the away team are assigned a section on this stand, usually in the eastern part of the North Stand, seperated from Br\u00f8ndby's home fans.\n\n=== West Stand ===\nThe West Stand, known as \"[[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]-tribunen\", was originally named \"Frisko-tribunen and later also \"SAS-tribunen\" and \"Apollo-tribunen\". The original part of the stand was completed in 1979 as the first stand of the stadium, and it has been preserved through the large expansion in 1999\u20132000. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites, and is the ground's main grandstand.\n\n=== East Stand ===\nThe East Stand, now known as \"GSV-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was formerly called \"LOXAM-tribunen\", \"[[Codan]]-tribunen and \"DNE-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1982 and 1990. The East Stand was originally without a roof, and consisted of terraces. Today, it is the largest stand of Br\u00f8ndby Stadion with a total of 34 rows of seats. In 2006, a larger extension was established behind the stand from the facade, consisting of sponsor facilities, a sports bar and classrooms for Br\u00f8ndby Gymnasium. The classrooms were inaugurated on 8 January 2007. In April 2018, a new family lounge was opened behind the East Stand with both physical and Esports facilities.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe easiest way of getting to the stadium with public transport is with the [[S-tog]] or S-train. Line B (green) will stop at both Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster and Glostrup stations, where there are shuttle buses on match days. One can also walk from the stations, with the walk taking 15 minutes from Glostrup, and slightly longer from Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster.\n\n==National games==\nBr\u00f8ndby Stadion has been used five times as home ground for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]].
