The ''' National Gridiron League''' ('''NGL''') is a proposed [[gridiron football]] league. Prior to the postponed 2019 season, the league logo used was a near copy of the former [[United Football League (2009–2012)|United Football League]], while many of the team names and logos are also copies of former football teams. League chairman McClendon said that those trademarks had expired and it makes good business sense to recycle them in an attempt to capture the already existing fan-bases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/roanoke/new-roanoke-arena-football-league-tells-city-leaders-league-is-still-on-track |title=New Roanoke arena football league tells city leaders league is still on track |work=[[WSLS-TV]] |date=March 22, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
Initially the league announced that it had planned to start play as an [[Indoor American football|indoor football]] league in spring 2019, with 12 teams aligned in two divisions<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgridiron.com/about|title=About Us|work=National Gridiron League|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref> starting on March 30, 2019, and conclude with the inaugural Gridiron Bowl game on August 10, 2019, in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgridiron.com/events|title=Events |work=National Gridiron League|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> However, the league pushed back the announced start of the inaugural season to May 2019 amid reports the league has not had finalized leases for many of its teams.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tristatehomepage.com/sports/indiana-firebirds-to-play-shorter-schedule-than-originally-planned/1844618279 |title=Indiana Firebirds to play shorter schedule than originally planned |website=TristateHomepage.com |date=March 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/roanoke/new-indoor-football-league-with-roanoke-based-team-delayed-questioned |title=Will arena football actually come to Roanoke? |work=[[WSLS-TV]] |date=March 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.citizensvoice.com/sports/arena-football-could-return-to-region-1.2452001 |title=Arena football could return to region |work=[[The Citizens' Voice]] |date=March 2, 2019}}</ref>

'''Minnesota Youth Symphonies''', commonly referred to as '''MYS''', was founded in 1972 by Ralph Winkler. The program has four [[orchestra]]s composed of students from elementary level through high school,<ref name=classical>{{cite web|last1=Philpott|first1=Claire|title=School Spotlight: Minnesota Youth Symphonies|url=http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2014/10/28/school-spotlight-minnesota-youth-symphonies|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}</ref> with participation's based on an annual audition. MYS, led by co-artistic directors Manny and Claudette Laureano since 1988, performs at [[Orchestra Hall (Minneapolis)|Orchestra Hall]] in [[Minneapolis]], as well as other locations, and hosts workshops and classes.

== Orchestras==
Participation is based on an [[audition]] in which the prospective student must perform an appropriate solo, orchestral excerpt, scales and arpeggios, and must sight-read.

The orchestras perform three major concerts in the Twin Cities area, primarily at [[Orchestra Hall (Minneapolis)|Orchestra Hall]] in [[Minneapolis]]. There are also other performance opportunities throughout the year. Every fall the orchestras host the Symphony Solo Competition; the winners of the competition perform at the Symphony Orchestra's spring concert.<ref>{{cite web|title=5.6.07: Minnesota Youth Symphonies Soloists at Orchestra Hall|url=http://mspmag.com/arts-and-culture/the-morning-after/5607_minnesota_youth_symphonie/|website=Mpls.St.Paul Magazine|accessdate=May 10, 2017|language=en-us|date=19 December 2013}}</ref>

In addition to performances, MYS hosts workshops and classes, and an annual summer music program, that usually consists of a chamber string workshop and a composition workshop. The MYS Symphony Orchestra has historically, recently, and will continue to tour internationally. The most recent trip was to Cuba in the summer of 2017

==='''String Orchestra'''===

The String Orchestra is gauged for the intermediate playing level for only those who play the violin, cello, or bass. The orchestra provides these players with a comprehensive string ensemble experience. The literature for the students is designed to broaden their repertoire and learn more advanced techniques for both playing and following a condcutor. The students learn how to successfully navigate difficult passages on their instrument and learn how to listen for orchestral intonation.

==='''Philharmonic Orchestra'''===

The Philharmonic Orchestra, which is designed to be a full symphony [[orchestra| ]], is placed at the advanced intermediate playing level. The literature is a combination of arranged and unedited works designed to expose students to a symphony orchestra experience. During rehearsals, there is time set aside for sectionals to iron out specific passages along with exploring different ways to play a passage and nuances to the piece.

Pieces that have been played by the Philharmonic Orchestra include ''[[Carmen Suites (Bizet/Guiraud)|Carmen Suites]]'' by [[Georges Bizet]], ''Dance of the Tumblers from [[The Snow Maiden|The Snow Maiden]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], a [[Merle J. Isaac|Merle J. Isaac]] arrangment of ''Dance Infernale, Berceuse and Finale'' from ''[[The Firebird|The Firebird]] ''by [[Igor Stravinsky|Igor Stravinsky]] and ''[[Finlandia|Finlandia]]'' by [[Jean Sibelius]].''

==='''Repertory Orchestra''' ===

The Repertory Orchestra is also designed to be a full symphony orchestra and is placed at the advanced level. Most, if not all, the literature in this orhcestra is unedited. The orchestra helps players refine advanced playing techniques in both sectionals and full-orchestra rehearsals.

The orchestra's repertoire includes the ''Overture'' from ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' by [[Leonard Bernstein|Leonard Bernstein]], ''[[William Tell Overture|William Tell Overture]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini|Gioachino Rossini]], ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Symphony No. 3]]'' (Organ) by [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Camille Saint-Saëns]], the ''Overture'' to ''[[Rienzi|Rienzi]]'' by [[Richard Wagner|Richard Wagner]], ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9]]'' (From the New World) by [[Antonín Dvořák|Antonín Dvořák]], ''[[Marche Slave|Marche Slave]]'' and ''[[Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 4]]'' both by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].

==='''Symphony Orchestra'''===

The Symphony Orchestra is also designed to be a symphony orchestra and plays at a collegiate level. The orchestra is considered the top orchestra in program. The program explores, in-depth, the many ways to interpret a phrase and other complex musical aspects. The orchestra also has an annual Symphony Solo Competition; the two winners of this competition perform their selected movement of their piece to perform with the Symphony Orchestra.

A few highlights of the orchestra's repertoire include ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]'' by Rimksy-Korsakov, ''[[The Rite of Spring|The Rite of Spring]]'' by Stravinsky, ''[[The Planets|The Planets]] '' by [[Gustav Holst|Gustav Holst]], ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 3]]'' by [[Gustav Mahler|Gustav Mahler]].

== Directors ==
MYS has been under the artistic direction of [[Manny Laureano]], principal trumpet of the [[Minnesota Orchestra]], and his wife, Claudette Laureano, director of the [[Breck School]]'s String Program, since 1988.<ref name=classical /> Previous music/artistic directors have included Ralph Winkler, Ed Forner (former Assistant Conductor with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and Professor of Music at [[Macalester College]]), [[Bill McGlaughlin]], Clyn D. Barrus and David Tubergen. Under Winkler and Forner's initial leadership, MYS grew from a single orchestra to three ensembles ranging from beginning students to college-level musicians. MYS grew to four orchestras and over 400 students under the Laureanos' leadership and MYS became known nationally as one of the nation's leading youth symphony organizations, adding a summer program and community outreach programs serving over 600 students.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== Alumni ==
Several alumni of the Minnesota Youth Symphonies program hold positions with professional orchestras, such as the [[Boston Symphony]], [[Cleveland Orchestra]], [[San Francisco Symphony]], [[Minnesota Orchestra]], the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== MYS ==
In 1972, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Society ended its sponsorship of the St. Paul Youth Orchestra, and Ralph Winkler established a new youth orchestra, the Minnesota Youth Symphony.

In 1992, the MYS Symphony Orchestra became the first orchestra to perform in the Super Bowl's half-time show, when [[Super Bowl XXVI]] was played at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in Minneapolis.<ref name=classical /> [[Elmer Bernstein]] guest-conducted \"The Magnificent Seven\" with the MYS Philharmonic Orchestra in 1997. MYS has collaborated with many noted guest artists, conductors and performing groups including Minnesota Orchestra Music Director [[Osmo Vänskä]], [[Butch Thompson]], Charles Lazarus, [[Jorja Fleezanis]], [[Bel Canto Chorus]], St. Paul City Ballet, Minnesota Boys Choir, Ignacio \"Nachito\" Herrera, [[Doc Severinsen]] and the T.C. Swing Dancers.<ref name=classical /> In the winter of 2007, MYS Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Manny Laureano, performed Stravinsky's ''[[Rite of Spring]]'' in concert at Orchestra Hall, which was a first for MYS.

The 2007/08 season marked the 35th anniversary of MYS as well as the 20th anniversary of co-artistic directors Claudette and Manny Laureano. In honor of these events, each of the Minnesota Youth Symphonies' four orchestras premiered original works by Minnesotan composers. Full orchestral pieces were commissioned from composers [[Stephen Paulus]], Shelley Hanson and MYS alumnus Edward (Teddy) Niedermaier. To select the fourth work, MYS held a composition competition open to MYS students and alumni under the age of 21. Aaron Hirsch, of [[Sleepy Eye, Minnesota|Sleepy Eye]], Minnesota won this contest with his composition for string orchestra.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nachito Herrera and Manny Laureano perform with the Minnesota Youth Symphonies|url=https://www.tcdailyplanet.net/nachito-herrera-and-manny-laureano-perform-minnesota-youth-symphonies/|website=Twin Cities Daily Planet|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 2015, MYS was invited to take part in the opening concerts at the newly renovated [[Ordway Center for the Performing Arts]]. During the two-year [[renovation]] of Orchestra Hall, MYS performed in various venues around the Twin Cities, such as churches and concert halls.

Full orchestral pieces were commissioned from composers [[Stephen Paulus]], Shelley Hanson and MYS alumnus Edward (Teddy) Niedermaier. To select the fourth work, MYS held a composition competition open to MYS students and alumni under the age of 21. Aaron Hirsch, of [[Sleepy Eye, Minnesota|Sleepy Eye]], Minnesota won this contest with his composition for string orchestra.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nachito Herrera and Manny Laureano perform with the Minnesota Youth Symphonies|url=https://www.tcdailyplanet.net/nachito-herrera-and-manny-laureano-perform-minnesota-youth-symphonies/|website=Twin Cities Daily Planet|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 2015, MYS was invited to take part in the opening concerts at the newly renovated [[Ordway Center for the Performing Arts]]. During the two-year [[renovation]] of Orchestra Hall, MYS performed in various venues around the Twin Cities, such as churches and concert halls.

{{distinguish|Psychopomp}}
The '''hypnopompic state''' (or '''hypnopompia''') is the [[state of consciousness]] leading out of [[sleep]], a term coined by the [[psychical researcher]] [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic Myers]]. Its mirror is the [[hypnagogic]] state at sleep onset; though often conflated, the two states are not identical. The hypnagogic state is [[Rationality|rational]] [[Waking up|waking]] [[cognition]] trying to make sense of non-linear images and associations; the hypnopompic state is [[emotion]]al and credulous [[dream]]ing cognition trying to make sense of real world stolidity. They have a different [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] character. While these hypnopompic hallucinations can be neutral, they are often more akin to nightmares. Further, they are frequently accompanied by e.g. [[sleep paralysis]], which is a state wherein the mind perceives itself to be awake, yet is unable to move the body, a truly terrifying disconnect between the soul and body. As such, hypnopompic hallucinations are deeply troubling experiences that for centuries now, have fascinated thinkers—most recently psychologists and increasingly now neurologists as well. Though the phenomena was once poorly understood it is now being illuminated by our growing understanding of sleep overall and in particular, our cutting edge brain-scanning technologies.

To better understand hypnopompic hallucinations, we must first define [[hallucination]]s.

== Neurobiology ==
The objective difference between the subjective experiences of dreams and hypnopompic hallucinations emerges from a close look at our sleep cycle and its attendant brain activity: there are essentially '''two types of sleep''', [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]], which is indeed categorised by [[Rapid eye movement sleep|“rapid eye movement]]” and [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM]], which stands for “Non-REM”. Now, in the first type of sleep, our brains are extremely active. In particular, during this stage, both our brain stem, which is the home of our most fundamental physical drives, and the parts of the cortex related to our most complex logical-cognitive functions experience highly '''intense''' electrical activity. As this perhaps suggests, REM is where the majority of dreaming occurs—it’s been all but confirmed at this point that [[dream]]s originate in the brain stem, a spark from there driving our more logical mind to contemplate and consolidate, through dreaming, memories that relate to fulfilling our fundamental drives. Conversely, there is almost no electrical activity during NREM sleep. It will thus be no surprise that NREM is what is referred to in layman’s terms as “[[Slow-wave sleep|deep sleep]]”, which is characterised by the complete quieting of the mind, to include dreamlessness and by muscle “[[Atony|atonia]]”, which is to basically say paralysis, a complete motor disconnect. A last critical point in this regard is that REM sleep cycles are bookended by NREM stages, which is to say that when we fall asleep and wake up, we first fall into and last arise from, NREM sleep.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Waters|first=Flavie|last2=Blom|first2=Jan Dirk|last3=Dang-Vu|first3=Thien Thanh|last4=Cheyne|first4=Allan J.|last5=Alderson-Day|first5=Ben|last6=Woodruff|first6=Peter|last7=Collerton|first7=Daniel|date=September 2016|title=What Is the Link Between Hallucinations, Dreams, and Hypnagogic–Hypnopompic Experiences?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4988750/|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|volume=42|issue=5|pages=1098–1109|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbw076|issn=0586-7614|pmc=4988750|pmid=27358492}}</ref>

It is precisely at this last point, though, that a minor '''glitch''', as it were, in brain chemistry, can cause hypnopompic hallucinations: occasionally during deep NREM, “transient patterns of neural activation in brainstem structures resemble[ing] micro-wake “fragments” can occur”.<ref name=\":1\" /> As the origin of the fragments and their name implies, they have a twofold effect: first, just as in REM sleep, these brain stem fragments essentially activate the dream mechanism. Second, they indeed catalyse a near-waking state. However, this spark is often not powerful enough to jar us completely out of deep sleep, and so only our mind fully awakens, leaving our body trapped in the '''atonia of deep sleep'''. Another reason why hypnopompic hallucinations are often such horrible experiences, is because micro-wake fragments appear to be related to [[serotonin]] and [[dopamine]] deficits—these deficits predispose us to negative mental states, which likely causes the hallucinations to resemble our worst dreams.<ref name=\":1\" />

== Cultural manifestations ==
These mental experiences are indeed often deeply damaging: across cultures, the experience of hypnopompic hallucinations are strongly related to “visitations of spirits, demons or other grotesque creatures belonging to traditional folklore”.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, in the Anglosphere, hypnopompic experiences often entail the sense that an '''“[[Old hag|Old Hag]]”''' or some similar '''“nocturnal spirit”''' is sitting on the sleeper’s chest, inducing both paralysis and an increasing, suffocating inability to move. Anthropologists have discovered references dating back to the High Middle ages of similar figures in Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman traditions, most prominently the '''“''[[Maera (hound)|mæra]]”''''' from the name of which figure we derive the word '''“nightmare”''', and which appears to have roots in ancient Germanic superstitions.

Similarly, subjects belonging to '''Yoruban-African diasporas''' report feeling as though they are being '''“ridden”''' by the evil manifestations of their versions of the African pantheon—ridden is the vernacular for possession by the gods, who are often referred to as '''“divine horsemen”'''. Interestingly in this vein, African-American communities that have been reliably linked to the Yoruba peoples, appear to conflate the cultural interpretation of the experience, referring to “being ridden by the witch”. Perhaps most chilling of all, though, are the Japanese interpretations of the experience, which are often grouped under the heading of '''''kanashibari''','' which translates loosely to '''“buried alive and bound in metal”'''.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Future research horizons ==
Owing to similarities between hypnagogic hallucinations and those experienced by sufferers from dementia, parkinson’s and schizophrenia, significant progress is being made on understanding the '''neurobiological basis''' of this experience. To illustrate, researchers have identified “a common neurofunctional substrate [which] points to a shared pattern of brain activation” underlying elements of '''schizophrenic delusions''' and these near-waking hallucinations: “with regional grey matter blood flow values being maximally increased in right parietal-occipital regions” during hypnagogic hallucinations and many schizoid episodes. There is reason to believe, then, that such painful near-waking experiences could soon be rendered '''obsolete'''.<ref name=\":0\" />

{{distinguish|Psychopomp}}
The '''hypnopompic state''' (or '''hypnopompia''') is the [[state of consciousness]] leading out of [[sleep]], a term coined by the [[psychical researcher]] [[Frederic William Henry Myers|Frederic Myers]]. Its mirror is the [[hypnagogic]] state at sleep onset; though often conflated, the two states are not identical. The hypnagogic state is [[Rationality|rational]] [[Waking up|waking]] [[cognition]] trying to make sense of non-linear images and associations; the hypnopompic state is [[emotion]]al and credulous [[dream]]ing cognition trying to make sense of real world stolidity. They have a different [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] character. While these hypnopompic hallucinations can be neutral, they are often more akin to nightmares. Further, they are frequently accompanied by e.g. [[sleep paralysis]], which is a state wherein the mind perceives itself to be awake, yet is unable to move the body, a truly terrifying disconnect between the soul and body. As such, hypnopompic hallucinations are deeply troubling experiences that for centuries now, have fascinated thinkers—most recently psychologists and increasingly now neurologists as well. Though the phenomena was once poorly understood it is now being illuminated by our growing understanding of sleep overall and in particular, our cutting edge brain-scanning technologies.

To better understand hypnopompic hallucinations, we must first define [[hallucination]]s. These are commonly understood as “sensory perceptions that occur in the absence of an objective stimulus”.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=D’Agostino|first=Armando|title=Hypnagogic Hallucinations and Sleep Paralysis|date=2010|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4419-0854-4_8|work=Narcolepsy|pages=87–97|editor-last=Goswami|editor-first=Meeta|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0854-4_8 armando d'agostino, ivan limosani university of milan|isbn=978-1-4419-0853-7|access-date=2020-04-12|last2=Limosani|first2=Ivan|editor2-last=Pandi-Perumal|editor2-first=S.

\"'''Ilomilo'''\" (stylized in [[lowercase|all lowercase]]) is a song by American singer [[Billie Eilish]] from her debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]''. It was written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, who also produced the song. The song peaked at number 62 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2019-04-13 |title=Billboard |website= Billboard |publisher= Billboard|accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> and charted in the top 100 in multiple countries. It was also certified gold in Australia, Canada, and the United States.

It is preceded by \"[[Bury a Friend]]\" on its parent album, and the beginning instrumental of \"Ilomilo\" is featured at the end of its preceding track. The song impacted contemporary hit radio in Italy on April 10, 2020. But was actually released on March 29.<ref name = radio>{{Cite web|url=http://radiodate.it/radio-date/billie-eilish-ilomilo-200412-10-04-2020-radiodate/|title=BILLIE EILISH \"ilomilo\" {{!}} (Radio Date: 10/04/2020)|website=radiodate.it|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>

==Background==
The song was inspired by the computer game [[ilomilo]], which is a 2010 puzzle game where the goal is to reunite two characters named \"Ilo\" and \"Milo\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Madeline|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3119965/finneas-oconnell-billie-eilish-album-breakdown/|title=BILLIE EILISH'S WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP: A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN FROM FINNEAS O'CONNELL|work=[[MTV]]|date=April 4, 2019|access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref> The song was also partially inspired by the novel and film ''Bridge to Terabithia''.<ref>https://twitter.com/eilishupdates/status/1159608493453824001</ref> Eilish states: \"I used to play ilomilo a lot. I loved ilomilo, that was like my favorite game in the world. It's this game where it's these two little creatures – one is named ilo and the other's named milo. It's this sort of anti-gravity world where there's all these little blocks and they start apart from each other. The idea is you just get to each other and when they get to each other they just hug, there's no prize.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Prance|first=Sam|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/billie-eilish-ilomilo-lyrics-meaning/|title=Billie Eilish reveals the adorable story and meaning behind her 'ilomilo' lyrics|work=PopBuzz|date=March 29, 2019|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref>

In an Interview with ''MTV'', Finneas states that \"I like songs that exist with the knowledge of other songs. They're not linked in that they need each other to exist, necessarily, but they're like two different episodes of the same TV show. Just little fun things like bleeding songs into each other, those make it feel like a full album.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Madeline|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3119965/finneas-oconnell-billie-eilish-album-breakdown/|title=BILLIE EILISH'S WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP: A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN FROM FINNEAS O'CONNELL|work=[[MTV]]|date=April 4, 2019|access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>

==Composition and lyrics==
The song is a mid tempo song  that is played in the key of [[C minor]], while Eilish's vocals span a range of G<sub>3</sub> to A<sub>b4</sub>. The first half is moderately fast at 120 beats per minute (BPM). The genre of the song was Alternative Pop/Rock and Indie Pop<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0195182|title=Billie Eilish \"ilomilo\" Sheet Music|publisher=Musicnotes.com|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> 

\"Ilomilo\" is about a person being separated from someone they love dearly and are trying to find them again. In it, Billie sings lines like: \"I don't wanna be lonely\" and \"I can't lose another life\". She also appears to reference a failed relationship by adding: \"I just wanted to protect you, but now I'll never get to.\" The person is afraid that their loved one will depart and never return. The person believes that the love they share is incomparable to what he will find in the outside world. Ultimately the song finishes with the chorus, where the person has been realized they are alone and their loved one is gone. The person is unaware of their location and wonders if they'll ever return. The persons desire for their loved one to “come home” is so strong that they don't even care if they are such under false pretenses. <ref>{{cite web|last=Prance|first=Sam|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/billie-eilish-ilomilo-lyrics-meaning/|title=Billie Eilish reveals the adorable story and meaning behind her 'ilomilo' lyrics|work=PopBuzz|date=March 29, 2019|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> The song is introduced during the final seconds of \"Bury a Friend.\" There are lyrical reference to \"Bury a Friend\" in \"Ilomilo\": \"The friends I've had to bury, they keep me up at night\". Fans have speculated that the two songs are linked, but Finneas says the connection is more about making the album sound cohesive.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Madeline|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3119965/finneas-oconnell-billie-eilish-album-breakdown/|title=BILLIE EILISH'S WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP: A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN FROM FINNEAS O'CONNELL|work=[[MTV]]|date=April 4, 2019|access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>

==Reception==
\"Ilomilo\" was met with critical appraise. In 2020, Insider placed the song at number 13 on their ''Every Billie Eilish song, ranked'' list, with Libby Torres calling it \"a catchy, mid tempo song with insanely relatable lyrics.\"<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.insider.com/billie-eilish-songs-ranked-best-worst|title = Every Billie Eilish song, ranked|author = Callie Ahlgrim, Libby Torres and Claudia Willen|access-date = April 5, 2020|date = March 18, 2020|website = Insider}}</ref> ''Circa the Future'' called it \"an underrated song\" and that \"her delicate vocals shine in this stunning song\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://circathepresent.blog/every-billie-eilish-song-ranked/|title =Every Billie Eilish Song Ranked|author=none|access-date = April 5, 2020|website = Circa the future}}</ref> ''[[Stereogum]]''{{'s}} Chris DeVille called the song a \"skittering\" track and that the song seems to be grappling with her place in a world wrecked by tragedy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2037018/billie-eilish-album-review/franchises/the-week-in-pop/|title=Billie Eilish's Time Is Now|date=April 10, 2020|accessdate=July 14, 2019|author=DeVille, Chris|work=[[Stereogum]]}}</ref>

\"'''Ilomilo'''\" (stylized in [[lowercase|all lowercase]]) is a song by American singer [[Billie Eilish]] from her debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]''. It was written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, who also produced the song. The song peaked at number 62 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2019-04-13 |title=Billboard |website= Billboard |publisher= Billboard|accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> and charted in the top 100 in multiple countries. It was also certified gold in Australia, Canada, and the United States.

It is preceded by \"[[Bury a Friend]]\" on its parent album, and the beginning instrumental of \"Ilomilo\" is featured at the end of its preceding track. The song impacted contemporary hit radio in Italy on April 10, 2020.<ref name = radio>{{Cite web|url=http://radiodate.it/radio-date/billie-eilish-ilomilo-200412-10-04-2020-radiodate/|title=BILLIE EILISH \"ilomilo\" {{!}} (Radio Date: 10/04/2020)|website=radiodate.it|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>

==Background==
The song was inspired by the computer game [[ilomilo]], which is a 2010 puzzle game where the goal is to reunite two characters named \"Ilo\" and \"Milo\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Madeline|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3119965/finneas-oconnell-billie-eilish-album-breakdown/|title=BILLIE EILISH'S WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP: A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN FROM FINNEAS O'CONNELL|work=[[MTV]]|date=April 4, 2019|access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref> The song was also partially inspired by the novel and film ''Bridge to Terabithia''.<ref>https://twitter.com/eilishupdates/status/1159608493453824001</ref> Eilish states: \"I used to play ilomilo a lot. I loved ilomilo, that was like my favorite game in the world. It's this game where it's these two little creatures – one is named ilo and the other's named milo. It's this sort of anti-gravity world where there's all these little blocks and they start apart from each other. The idea is you just get to each other and when they get to each other they just hug, there's no prize.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Prance|first=Sam|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/billie-eilish-ilomilo-lyrics-meaning/|title=Billie Eilish reveals the adorable story and meaning behind her 'ilomilo' lyrics|work=PopBuzz|date=March 29, 2019|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref>

In an Interview with ''MTV'', Finneas states that \"I like songs that exist with the knowledge of other songs. They're not linked in that they need each other to exist, necessarily, but they're like two different episodes of the same TV show. Just little fun things like bleeding songs into each other, those make it feel like a full album.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Madeline|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3119965/finneas-oconnell-billie-eilish-album-breakdown/|title=BILLIE EILISH'S WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP: A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN FROM FINNEAS O'CONNELL|work=[[MTV]]|date=April 4, 2019|access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>

==Composition and lyrics==
The song is a mid tempo song  that is played in the key of [[C minor]], while Eilish's vocals span a range of G<sub>3</sub> to A<sub>b4</sub>. The first half is moderately fast at 120 beats per minute (BPM). The genre of the song was Alternative Pop/Rock and Indie Pop<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0195182|title=Billie Eilish \"ilomilo\" Sheet Music|publisher=Musicnotes.com|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> 

\"Ilomilo\" is about a person being separated from someone they love dearly and are trying to find them again. In it, Billie sings lines like: \"I don't wanna be lonely\" and \"I can't lose another life\". She also appears to reference a failed relationship by adding: \"I just wanted to protect you, but now I'll never get to.\" The person is afraid that their loved one will depart and never return. The person believes that the love they share is incomparable to what he will find in the outside world. Ultimately the song finishes with the chorus, where the person has been realized they are alone and their loved one is gone. The person is unaware of their location and wonders if they'll ever return. The persons desire for their loved one to “come home” is so strong that they don't even care if they are such under false pretenses. <ref>{{cite web|last=Prance|first=Sam|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/billie-eilish-ilomilo-lyrics-meaning/|title=Billie Eilish reveals the adorable story and meaning behind her 'ilomilo' lyrics|work=PopBuzz|date=March 29, 2019|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> The song is introduced during the final seconds of \"Bury a Friend.\" There are lyrical reference to \"Bury a Friend\" in \"Ilomilo\": \"The friends I've had to bury, they keep me up at night\". Fans have speculated that the two songs are linked, but Finneas says the connection is more about making the album sound cohesive.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Madeline|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3119965/finneas-oconnell-billie-eilish-album-breakdown/|title=BILLIE EILISH'S WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP: A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN FROM FINNEAS O'CONNELL|work=[[MTV]]|date=April 4, 2019|access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>

'''Kirtland's snake''' (''Clonophis kirtlandii'') is a threatened or endangered (depending on location) [[North America]]n [[species]] of nonvenomous [[snake]] of the subfamily [[Natricinae]], of the family [[Colubridae]].<ref>{{EMBL species|genus=Clonophis|species=kirtlandii}} www.reptile-database.org.</ref> It is the only species in the [[genus]] ''[[Clonophis]]''.<ref>\"''Clonophis kirtlandii'' \". ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System). www.itis.gov.</ref>

==Etymology==
The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''kirtlandii'', is in honor of Dr. [[Jared Potter Kirtland]], an American [[naturalist]] of the Nineteenth Century.<ref>Beltz, Ellin (2006).

(''Clonophis kirtlandi'', p. 142).</ref> The snake was first identified by [[Robert Kennicott]] in 1855. Kennicott sent a specimen to [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]], the assistant secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], who offered to publish a description of the animal in Kennicott's name. Baird suggested ''Regina kirtlandii'' as a scientific name, as Kirtland had been a mentor to Kennicott.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vasile|first=Ronald S.|title=The Early Career of Robert Kennicott, Illinois' Pioneering Naturalist|jstor=40192718|journal=Illinois Historical Journal|volume=87|number=3|date=Autumn 1994|pp=165}}</ref>

==Common names==
[[Common names]] for ''C. kirtlandii'' include: Cora Kennicott's snake, Kirtland's red snake, Kirtland's water snake, little red snake, Ohio Valley water snake, and spread head.<ref name=\"Wright&Wright1957\">[[Albert Hazen Wright|Wright, A.H.]], and [[Anna Allen Wright|A.A.

Ithaca and London: Comstock. 1,105 pp. (in 2 volumes) (''Natrix kirtlandi'', pp. 496-499, Figure 146 + Map 40 on p. 491).</ref>

==Description==
Kirtland's snake is small and slender. Adults reach a total length (including tail) of 12-18&nbsp;inches (30–46&nbsp;cm). It is grayish brown with a double series of large black spots down the back, and alternating smaller spots running down each side.<ref>[[George Albert Boulenger|Boulenger, G.A.]] (1893).

==Geographic range==
Kirtland's snake is found in [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], northern [[Kentucky]], southern [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], and western [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"Conant1975\"/>

==Habitat==
The preferred natural [[habitat]]s of ''C. kirtlandii'' are [[forest]], [[grassland]], and [[wetlands]]<ref name=iucn/> such as [[swamp]]s and [[marsh]]es. It is almost always found very close to a water source, even though it is less [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] than water snakes of the genus ''[[Nerodia]]'' which share its geographic range.<ref name=\"Wright&Wright1957\"/>

==Conservation status==
The species ''Clonophis kirtlandii'' is listed as endangered in [[Indiana]],<ref name=312iac>{{citation|author=Indiana Legislative Services Agency|year=2011|title=312 IAC 9-5-4: Endangered species of reptiles and amphibians|work=Indiana Administrative Code|accessdate=28 Apr 2012|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/iac/}}.</ref>  [[Michigan]], and [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Pennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission.</ref> It is listed as threatened in [[Illinois]] and [[Ohio]], though current research in Ohio is leaning towards the snake being listed as vulnerable.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Diet==
Kirtland's snake feeds on primarily [[crayfish]], along with the occasional [[earthworm]], [[slug]], [[minnow]], [[salamander]], [[frog]] and [[toad]].<ref name=\"Wright&Wright1957\"/>

Kirtland's snake may have a venom adapted towards killing crayfish.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Defensive behavior==
When alarmed ''C. kirtlandii'' flattens its entire body to a remarkable thinness, and becomes rigid.<ref>[[Karl Patterson Schmidt|Schmidt, K.P.]], and [[Delbert Dwight Davis|D.D. Davis]] (1941). ''Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada''. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (''Natrix kirtlandii'', pp. 209-210 + Plate 22, Center, on p. 342).</ref> Kirtland's snake will also coil up into a disc the size of about a quarter in an attempt to hide from potential threats. If this does not succeed, it will then flee instead of fight.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

No person on record has ever been bitten by a Kirtland's snake. This species prefers intimidation, hiding, and fleeing rather than any form of fighting.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Reproduction==
Kirtland's snake is [[ovoviviparous]]. Females give birth in August and September. Brood size varies from 4 to 22. Each newborn is 13–17&nbsp;cm (5-6¾ in.) in total length and averages 1.4 gm in weight.<ref name=\"Wright&Wright1957\"/>

==Geographic range==
Kirtland's snake is found in [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], northern [[Kentucky]], southern [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], and western [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"Conant1975\"/>

==Habitat==
The preferred natural [[habitat]]s of ''C. kirtlandii'' are [[forest]], [[grassland]], and [[wetlands]]<ref name=iucn/> such as [[swamp]]s and [[marsh]]es. It is almost always found very close to a water source, even though it is less [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] than water snakes of the genus ''[[Nerodia]]'' which share its geographic range.<ref name=\"Wright&Wright1957\"/>

==Conservation status==
The species ''Clonophis kirtlandii'' is listed as endangered in [[Indiana]],<ref name=312iac>{{citation|author=Indiana Legislative Services Agency|year=2011|title=312 IAC 9-5-4: Endangered species of reptiles and amphibians|work=Indiana Administrative Code|accessdate=28 Apr 2012|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/iac/}}.</ref>  [[Michigan]], and [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Pennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission.</ref> It is listed as threatened in [[Illinois]] and [[Ohio]], though current research in Ohio is leaning towards the snake being listed as vulnerable.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Diet==
Kirtland's snake feeds on primarily [[crayfish]], along with the occasional [[earthworm]], [[slug]], [[minnow]], [[salamander]], [[frog]] and [[toad]].<ref name=\"Wright&Wright1957\"/>

Kirtland's snake may have a venom adapted towards killing crayfish.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Defensive behavior==
When alarmed ''C. kirtlandii'' flattens its entire body to a remarkable thinness, and becomes rigid.<ref>[[Karl Patterson Schmidt|Schmidt, K.P.]], and [[Delbert Dwight Davis|D.D. Davis]] (1941). ''Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada''. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (''Natrix kirtlandii'', pp. 209-210 + Plate 22, Center, on p. 342).</ref> Kirtland's snake will also coil up into a disc the size of about a quarter in an attempt to hide from potential threats. If this does not succeed, it will then flee instead of fight.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

No person on record has ever been bitten by a Kirtland's snake. This species prefers intimidation, hiding, and fleeing rather than any form of fighting.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Reproduction==
Kirtland's snake is [[ovoviviparous]]. Females give birth in August and September. Brood size varies from 4 to 22. Each newborn is 13–17&nbsp;cm (5-6¾ in.) in total length and averages 1.4 gm in weight.<ref name=\"Wright&Wright1957\"/>

[[File:St Andrews Church..png|thumb|Adforton's local parish church St Andrews.]]
'''Adforton''' is a small village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in north [[Herefordshire]], England. It is located north of Wigmore, close to the Wales border, and is surrounded by agricultural fields.

It has a church which doubles as a community hall. It is situated on the [[A4110 road|A4110 main road]] approximately {{convert|22|mi}} north of [[Hereford]]. 
In 1870–72, Adforton was described as

:\"a township with Stanway, Paytoe, and Grange, in the parish of Leintwardine, in Hereford 2 miles north west of Wigmore with a population of 250 people and 57 houses within the area,\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=John Marius|title=Gazetteer of England and Wales|date=1870|publisher=A. Fullerton & Co.|location=London|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/4894|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> by John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales.
It had a population of 128 according to the 2011 census.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Adforton|title=Key figures for 2011 census: Key statistics|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11119835&c=Adforton&d=16&e=62&g=6386047&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1422372828973&enc=1|website=www.neighbourhoodstatistics.gov.uk|publisher=Office for national statistics|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>
Adforton provides a full programme of local events throughout the year to residents and visitors. Parish events include guided walks and village fetes. The local history clubs also provide talks about local life in the area from the past. Adforton is also a very keen society in terms of music. Open mic events are regularly put on in pubs, while more classical musical tastes can be satisfied in the local churches. Other events include sporting activities such as cycling, challenge events, orienteering and car rallying events in the countryside. The tourism industry benefits here and as a result a number of high quality holiday accommodations are available such as inns, cottages and bed and breakfast facilities that attract a lot of attention from visitors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adforton events and whats on|url=http://www.exploremortimercountry.com/s1l45/events-and-whats-on-adforton.htm|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>

==Main Buildings.==
St Andrews Church was designed and built in 1874 by an architect called J Gilmore. Until this Church was built there was only one other in Adforton, which was the Primitive Methodist Chapel built in 1863. The Royal George Inn is the only public house left in the village. It dates as far back as 1723, and tradition has it that the timbers used for construction, were taken from the ship 'The Royal George', and hence why the Inn is called what it is. However, due to the fact that the ship went down all hands off Spithead on 29 August 1782, so the story seems unlikely.<ref>{{cite web|title=St Andrews Church|url=http://www.hevac-heritage.org/items_of_interest/ventilation/adforton_church/adforton_church.htm|website=www.hevac-heritage.org|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>

==Population of Adforton analysis.==
Adforton is only a small parish, and as a result, it is hard to interpret whether any changes in the population have been significant or a consequence of an event or change in culture. However between 1881 and 2001, it has clearly fluctuated throughout the decades, but yet eventually been reduced from 204 to 118, which could be judged as a significant reduction for such a small area. From the census data we know that the peak population was in 1901 where the population sat at 215 people however then started to drop in the later decades. In 2001 it reached its lowest point within the time period at 118, however it has begun to rise again, as in 2011 the population was recorded at 128, which is what it sits at now. The reason for the drop pre 2011 may be a consequence of improvements in travel allowing for more people to live in the urban areas. Despite this a growing trend for commuting has occurred in the last decade, which may be why the population is beginning to rise again.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Office For National Statistics|title=Key figures for 2011 census for Adforton: Population|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11119835&c=adforton&d=16&e=62&g=6386047&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1430046558908&enc=1|website=Neighbourhood Statistics|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Adforton population data 1881–1961|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10169744/cube/TOT_POP|website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>

==Occupational data from the 1881 census.==
The census data for 1881 shows us that agricultural work was the dominant occupation amongst males at the time, as 32 men worked on farms and with animals etc. However, there were men employed in other occupations such as Professional jobs, furniture designers and lodging. As for females, the data shows that most occupations (29) were unspecified and another six were unknown, but despite this the occupation with the most women employed in it was domestic services/ offices. Women did still work in agriculture but not as much as males. The culture at this present time was a significant influence on the structure of workforces. At the time, the tradition was that the men would go out and work and bring in the money, whilst the women would stay at home and look after the children, which could explain why not as many women were involved in the workforce structure make up of Adforton.<ref>{{cite web|title=1881 occupational data for Adforton.|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10169744/cube/OCC_ORDER1881|website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>

==Occupational data from the 2011 census.==
The types of occupation have obviously significantly changed over the decades, as new job opportunities have been brought to the people of Adforton. According to the 2011 census data, the occupation type with the most males working in it from the parish is jobs involved with skilled trades. Other occupations with a high count are Managers, directors and senior officials, and professionals with a 6 males each employed within them. The occupations with the lowest counts are sales and customer service and Administrative and secretarial occupations.  For women the occupations with the highest counts are Administrative and Secretarial services with 8 while the lowest is professional occupations. Since 1881, a lot has changed in the social attitudes related to occupational trends throughout the whole country. Improvements in women's rights have led to more women being employed in the same jobs as men, which therefore explains the clear differentiations from the occupational statistics for 1881, in comparison to 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Occupation data for Adforton- Females, 2011 census.|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=11119835&c=adforton&d=16&e=62&g=6386047&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1430046867502&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2544|website=www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.org|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Occupation data for Adforton: Males, 2011 census.|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=11119835&c=adforton&d=16&e=62&g=6386047&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1430046867502&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2542|website=neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Cyprus]] in 1960. The [[House of Representatives (Cyprus)|House of Representatives]] was elected on 31 July 1960,<ref>[[Dieter Nohlen]] & Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p438 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref> whilst the [[Communal Chambers]] were elected on 7 August.<ref name=YO/> In the House of Representatives 35 seats were elected by [[Greek Cypriots]] and 15 by [[Turkish Cypriots]].<ref name=NS2>Nohlen & Stöver, p434</ref> The result was a victory for the [[Patriotic Front (Cyprus)|Patriotic Front]], which won 30 of the 50 seats. In the Communal Chambers, the Patriotic Front won 20 of the 26 seats in the Greek Chamber, whilst the [[Cyprus Turkish National Union]] won all seats in the Turkish Chamber.

==Electoral system==
The House of Representatives consisted of 35 Greek members and 15 Turkish members, whilst the Greek Communal Chamber had 26 members (of which three were reserved for minorities) and the Turkish Communal Chamber had 30.

The 1959 electoral law divided Cyprus into six multi-member constituencies. Voters could vote for as many candidates as there were seats in their constituency.<ref name=MWC/> The electoral system used was [[Plurality voting]].

The hastily formed Pancyprian Union of Fighters fielded 4 candidates, with 2 in Nicosia,1 in Kyrenia and 1 in Larnaca.

The Patriotic Front and AKEL pressured independent candidates to withdraw from the elections. As a result, the only female candidate, Kallistheni Maouni, withdrew her candidacy.

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Cyprus]] in 1960. The [[House of Representatives (Cyprus)|House of Representatives]] was elected on 31 July 1960,<ref>[[Dieter Nohlen]] & Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p438 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref> whilst the [[Communal Chambers]] were elected on 7 August.<ref name=YO/> In the House of Representatives 35 seats were elected by [[Greek Cypriots]] and 15 by [[Turkish Cypriots]].<ref name=NS2>Nohlen & Stöver, p434</ref> The result was a victory for the [[Patriotic Front (Cyprus)|Patriotic Front]], which won 30 of the 50 seats. In the Communal Chambers, the Patriotic Front won 20 of the 26 seats in the Greek Chamber, whilst the [[Cyprus Turkish National Union]] won all seats in the Turkish Chamber.

==Electoral system==
The House of Representatives consisted of 35 Greek members and 15 Turkish members, whilst the Greek Communal Chamber had 26 members (of which three were reserved for minorities) and the Turkish Communal Chamber had 30.

The 1959 electoral law divided Cyprus into six multi-member constituencies. Voters could vote for as many candidates as there were seats in their constituency.<ref name=MWC/> The electoral system used was [[Plurality voting]].

==Campaign==
The [[Democratic Union (Cyprus)|Democratic Union]] led by [[Themistocles Dervis]] and [[Ioannis Clerides]] did not participate in the elections.<ref name=YO>Yitzhak Oron ''Middle East Record Volume 1, 1960'' The Moshe Dayan Centre, p225</ref><ref name=MWC>Marshall William Conley (1967) [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6314&context=opendissertations Political Community and Social Conflict: Cyprus]</ref> The Democratic Union had opposed the 1959 electoral law, claiming it favoured the Patriotic Front.<ref name=MWC/>

The Patriotic Front and [[Progressive Party of Working People|AKEL]] formed a pact for the elections, with a pre-agreed split of 30 and 5 seats respectively.<ref name=MWC/> 

The hastily formed Pancyprian Union of Fighters fielded 4 candidates, with 2 in Nicosia,1 in Kyrenia and 1 in Larnaca.

The Patriotic Front and AKEL pressured independent candidates to withdraw from the elections. As a result, the only female candidate, Kallistheni Maouni, withdrew her candidacy.

In Paphos the 3 candidates of the Patriotic Front and 1 candidate of AKEL were elected unopposed.<ref name=\"Eklektor\">{{cite web |last1=Christophorou |first1=Christophoros |title=Βουλευτικές εκλογές, 31 Ιουλίου 1960 |url=http://www.eklektor.org/el/vouleftikes-ekloges-1960-analysi/ |website=Eklektor |accessdate=11 April 2020 |language=el}}</ref>

In the fifteen Turkish seats, eight members of the [[Cyprus Turkish National Union]] ran unopposed in [[Nicosia]], [[Kyrenia]] and [[Larnaka]], whilst 8 independent candidates ran against the Cyprus Turkish National Union’s candidates in [[Famagusta]], [[Limassol]] and [[Paphos]].<ref>Nohlen & Stöver, p441</ref>

No elections were held for the Communal Chambers except for the Greek Cypriot members of Kyrenia. All other candidates were elected unopposed.<ref name=\"Eklektor\" />

'''David Harris''' (c. 1755 – 19 May 1803) was an English professional [[cricket]]er who played [[first-class cricket]] from 1782 to 1798.

He made 79 known first-class appearances<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/29/29984/Other_matches.html|title=Other matches played by David Harris (79)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref> and was mainly associated with [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] when its teams were organised by the [[Hambledon Club]]. As well as playing for Hampshire, Harris appeared for a number of other teams including [[Berkshire county cricket teams|Berkshire]], [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]], [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]], [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and several invitation XIs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/29/29984/all_teams.html|title=Teams played for by David Harris|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref>

Noted for his fast and accurate bowling, Harris was a right arm fast [[underarm bowling|underarm]] bowler and a left-handed batsman.

==Career==
Born c. 1755, [[Elvetham]], Hampshire, The earliest known mention of David Harris occurs in a minor match at [[Odiham]] on 27 May 1782 when he played for [[Alresford Cricket Club|Alresford]] and Odiham against a Hampshire County XI.<ref>Waghorn, p.55.</ref> He played for Odiham again in October 1782 in a match against a Berkshire XI, when another Odiham player in the game was one T. Harris.<ref>Waghorn, p.56.</ref>

Harris' first recorded game for Hampshire was against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] on 3–5 July 1782, a match which also featured the known debut of Kent's [[Joey Ring]].<ref name=\"SB51\">Haygarth, p. 51.</ref> Although he was never noted as a batsman, Harris made the top score of 27 in Hampshire's first innings, in which they were dismissed for 87.<ref name=\"SB51\"/> Harris played three times for Hampshire in the 1783 season, twice against Kent and once against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]]. He took nine wickets in these matches.<ref>Haygarth, p.57–59.</ref>

Harris is only recorded once in 1784 when he again played for Odiham in a minor match. In 1785, when few first-class matches took place, Harris played for [[Berkshire county cricket teams|Berkshire]] against [[Essex county cricket teams|Essex]].<ref>Waghorn, p. 64.</ref>

On 13 July 1776, Harris had his best known performance to date when he took four 1st innings wickets for Hampshire v. Kent at [[Windmill Down]], Hampshire winning the game by 1 wicket. This was the match in which [[Tom Sueter]] was given out [[hit the ball twice]], the earliest recorded instance of this form of dismissal.<ref>Haygarth, p. 66.</ref> On 8–12 August of the same year, Harris played for the [[White Conduit Club]] against Kent at [[Bourne Paddock]] and took six wickets in the match, three in each innings, to help White Conduit to a 164 run victory. White Conduit's big win was due to [[Tom Walker (cricketer)|Tom Walker]] and [[Thomas Taylor (cricketer)|Tom Taylor]] becoming the first players known to score a century in the same innings. Walker made 95* and 102, just missing the honour of becoming the first player to score two centuries in a match.<ref>Haygarth, p. 68.</ref>

Playing for [[Sir Horatio Mann]]'s XI against the [[George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea|Earl of Winchilsea]]'s XI at the new [[Lord's Old Ground]] on 26–28 May 1788, Harris took 10 wickets in the match with 4 in the 1st innings and 6 in the 2nd. But it was to little avail as Winchilsea's XI won by 106 runs.<ref>Haygarth, p.81.</ref>

By now, Harris' reputation was well established and he played regularly in major matches into the 1790s. He was a frequent taker of wickets and again took ten in a match on 30–31 August 1790 when he guided Hampshire to a 10-wicket win against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] at Lord's Old Ground.<ref>Haygarth, p.108.</ref> On 15–17 August 1792, Harris had the best known return of his career when he took 11 wickets in the match for Hampshire against Kent at Cobham Park, including eight in the first innings. Hampshire won by 8 wickets.<ref>Haygarth, p.140.</ref>

His later career was ruined by attacks of [[gout]] and Harris played his final match on 13–15 August 1798 for All-England v. Surrey at Lord's Old Ground. He took five wickets in the 1st innings and his last, subject to the batting order, was when he bowled [[W. Wells (Middlesex cricketer)|W Wells]] for 5. He scored 0* in his final innings and his team won the match by an innings and 1 run.<ref>Haygarth, p.243–244.</ref> He died 19 May 1803, [[Crookham Village]], Hampshire

==Style and technique==
{{cquote|In taking my place at the wicket, I almost felt as if taking my ground in a duel... and my terrors were so much increased by the mock pity and sympathy of Hammond, Beldham, and others round the wicket, that when this mighty bowler, this ''Jupiter tonas'', hurled his bolt at me, I shut my eyes in the intensity of my panic, and mechanically gave a random desperate blow, which, to my utter astonishment, was followed by a loud cry all over the ring of 'run, run'.<sub> – Playwright Lord [[Frederic Reynolds|Frederick Reynolds]] on facing Harris.</sub><ref name=\"Major2007\">{{cite book|last=Major|first=John S.|title=More than a Game: the Story of Cricket's Early Years|year=2007|publisher=HarperPress|location=London|isbn=0-00-718364-X|page=122}}</ref>}}

Harris was highly rated by his contemporaries, especially [[John Nyren]], who called him \"the very best bowler; a bowler who, between any one and himself, comparison must fail\".<ref name=\"N93\"/>

Nyren described Harris' style and technique in some detail. Harris began from an erect stance \"like a soldier at drill\" and raised the ball to his forehead before stepping forward. In his delivery stride, he brought the ball from under his arm \"by a twist\" and nearly as high as his armpit. With this action he would \"push it, as it were, from him\". Nyren says the speed of the delivery was \"extraordinary\" and that he could not understand how Harris managed to achieve such speed.<ref name=\"N94\"/>

Some line drawings of Harris and other players of the 1790s have survived.<ref>Mote, endpaper.</ref> Harris is shown in the characteristic pose described by Nyren as he began his action, standing erect with the ball raised over his head.<ref name=\"N94\"/> The ball when delivered was pitched very fast and accurately. Harris seems to have got \"pace off the pitch\" and Nyren has recorded that numerous batsmen received nasty injuries to their unprotected hands from balls that trapped their (ungloved) fingers against the bat handle.<ref name=\"N95\">Nyren, p.95.</ref>

'''David Harris''' (c. 1755 – 19 May 1803) was an English professional [[cricket]]er who played [[first-class cricket]] from 1782 to 1798.

He made 79 known first-class appearances<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/29/29984/Other_matches.html|title=Other matches played by David Harris (79)|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref> and was mainly associated with [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] when its teams were organised by the [[Hambledon Club]]. As well as playing for Hampshire, Harris appeared for a number of other teams including [[Berkshire county cricket teams|Berkshire]], [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]], [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]], [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and several invitation XIs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/29/29984/all_teams.html|title=Teams played for by David Harris|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref>

Noted for his fast and accurate bowling, Harris was a right arm fast [[underarm bowling|underarm]] bowler and a left-handed batsman.

==Career==
Born c. 1755, [[Elvetham]], Hampshire, The earliest known mention of David Harris occurs in a minor match at [[Odiham]] on 27 May 1782 when he played for [[Alresford Cricket Club|Alresford]] and Odiham against a Hampshire County XI.<ref>Waghorn, p.55.</ref> He played for Odiham again in October 1782 in a match against a Berkshire XI, when another Odiham player in the game was one T. Harris.<ref>Waghorn, p.56.</ref>

Harris' first recorded game for Hampshire was against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] on 3–5 July 1782, a match which also featured the known debut of Kent's [[Joey Ring]].<ref name=\"SB51\">Haygarth, p. 51.</ref> Although he was never noted as a batsman, Harris made the top score of 27 in Hampshire's first innings, in which they were dismissed for 87.<ref name=\"SB51\"/> Harris played three times for Hampshire in the 1783 season, twice against Kent and once against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]]. He took nine wickets in these matches.<ref>Haygarth, p.57–59.</ref>

Harris is only recorded once in 1784 when he again played for Odiham in a minor match. In 1785, when few first-class matches took place, Harris played for [[Berkshire county cricket teams|Berkshire]] against [[Essex county cricket teams|Essex]].<ref>Waghorn, p. 64.</ref>

On 13 July 1776, Harris had his best known performance to date when he took four 1st innings wickets for Hampshire v. Kent at [[Windmill Down]], Hampshire winning the game by 1 wicket. This was the match in which [[Tom Sueter]] was given out [[hit the ball twice]], the earliest recorded instance of this form of dismissal.<ref>Haygarth, p. 66.</ref> On 8–12 August of the same year, Harris played for the [[White Conduit Club]] against Kent at [[Bourne Paddock]] and took six wickets in the match, three in each innings, to help White Conduit to a 164 run victory. White Conduit's big win was due to [[Tom Walker (cricketer)|Tom Walker]] and [[Thomas Taylor (cricketer)|Tom Taylor]] becoming the first players known to score a century in the same innings. Walker made 95* and 102, just missing the honour of becoming the first player to score two centuries in a match.<ref>Haygarth, p. 68.</ref>

Playing for [[Sir Horatio Mann]]'s XI against the [[George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea|Earl of Winchilsea]]'s XI at the new [[Lord's Old Ground]] on 26–28 May 1788, Harris took 10 wickets in the match with 4 in the 1st innings and 6 in the 2nd. But it was to little avail as Winchilsea's XI won by 106 runs.<ref>Haygarth, p.81.</ref>

By now, Harris' reputation was well established and he played regularly in major matches into the 1790s. He was a frequent taker of wickets and again took ten in a match on 30–31 August 1790 when he guided Hampshire to a 10-wicket win against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] at Lord's Old Ground.<ref>Haygarth, p.108.</ref> On 15–17 August 1792, Harris had the best known return of his career when he took 11 wickets in the match for Hampshire against Kent at Cobham Park, including eight in the first innings. Hampshire won by 8 wickets.<ref>Haygarth, p.140.</ref>

His later career was ruined by attacks of [[gout]] and Harris played his final match on 13–15 August 1798 for All-England v. Surrey at Lord's Old Ground. He took five wickets in the 1st innings and his last, subject to the batting order, was when he bowled [[W. Wells (Middlesex cricketer)|W Wells]] for 5. He scored 0* in his final innings and his team won the match by an innings and 1 run.<ref>Haygarth, p.243–244.</ref> He died 19 May 1803, [[Crookham Village]], Hampshire

==Style and technique==
{{cquote|In taking my place at the wicket, I almost felt as if taking my ground in a duel... and my terrors were so much increased by the mock pity and sympathy of Hammond, Beldham, and others round the wicket, that when this mighty bowler, this ''Jupiter tonas'', hurled his bolt at me, I shut my eyes in the intensity of my panic, and mechanically gave a random desperate blow, which, to my utter astonishment, was followed by a loud cry all over the ring of 'run, run'.<sub> – Playwright Lord [[Frederic Reynolds|Frederick Reynolds]] on facing Harris.</sub><ref name=\"Major2007\">{{cite book|last=Major|first=John S.|title=More than a Game: the Story of Cricket's Early Years|year=2007|publisher=HarperPress|location=London|isbn=0-00-718364-X|page=122}}</ref>}}

Harris was highly rated by his contemporaries, especially [[John Nyren]], who called him \"the very best bowler; a bowler who, between any one and himself, comparison must fail\".<ref name=\"N93\"/>

Nyren described Harris' style and technique in some detail. Harris began from an erect stance \"like a soldier at drill\" and raised the ball to his forehead before stepping forward. In his delivery stride, he brought the ball from under his arm \"by a twist\" and nearly as high as his armpit. With this action he would \"push it, as it were, from him\". Nyren says the speed of the delivery was \"extraordinary\" and that he could not understand how Harris managed to achieve such speed.<ref name=\"N94\"/>

Some line drawings of Harris and other players of the 1790s have survived.<ref>Mote, endpaper.</ref> Harris is shown in the characteristic pose described by Nyren as he began his action, standing erect with the ball raised over his head.<ref name=\"N94\"/> The ball when delivered was pitched very fast and accurately. Harris seems to have got \"pace off the pitch\" and Nyren has recorded that numerous batsmen received nasty injuries to their unprotected hands from balls that trapped their (ungloved) fingers against the bat handle.<ref name=\"N95\">Nyren, p.95.</ref>

Like [[Thomas Boxall]] and the brothers [[Tom Walker (cricketer)|Tom]] and [[Harry Walker (cricketer)|Harry Walker]], Harris used to practice his bowling in a barn during the winter.<ref>Pycroft, p.51 & 75.</ref>

==Personal life==
Harris was born at Elvetham but moved when still a child to Crookham (now known as [[Crookham Village]]), where he lived for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"SB52\"/> He never married and was a [[pottery|potter]] by trade.<ref name=\"N93\"/><ref name=\"SB52\"/>

Nyren, who knew Harris personally, described him as \"a muscular, bony man, standing about five feet 9½ inches\".<ref name=\"N93\">Nyren, p.93.</ref> Nyren remarked on Harris' personality and looks by saying he had \"a remarkably kind and gentle expression\" and an \"honest face\".<ref name=\"N93\"/> Harris, said Nyren, was \"a man of so strict a principle\" and \"such high honour\".<ref name=\"N94\">Nyren, p.94.</ref>

Harris suffered from gout in his later years and the sources have recorded how he would arrive at a game on crutches and then sit on a chair between deliveries.<ref name=\"SB52\">Haygarth, p.52.</ref> He was unable to play after 1798 and \"latterly, in fact, was quite a cripple\".<ref name=\"SB52\"/> He died in 1803 at Crookham and was buried at nearby Crondall, though no tombstone was erected.<ref name=\"SB52\"/>

'''Pingelap''' is an [[atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], part of [[Pohnpei State]] of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], consisting of three islands: Pingelap Island, Sukoru and Daekae, linked by a [[reef]] system and surrounding a central [[lagoon]], although only Pingelap Island is inhabited.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book|title=Bountiful Island: A Study of Land Tenure on a Micronesian Atoll|first=David|last=Damas|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-88920-239-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bountifulislands0000dama}}</ref> The entire system has a [[land area]] of 1.8&nbsp;km² (455 acres) at high-tide, and is less than {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} at its widest point.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pingelap Politics and American-Micronesian Relations| first=David|last=Damas|journal=Ethnology|year=1985 |volume=24|issue=1|doi=10.2307/3773489|pages=43–55|jstor=3773489|publisher=}}</ref> The atoll has its own language, [[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]], spoken by most of the atoll's 250 residents.

==History==
[[Image:Pohnpei.png|thumb|250px|right|A map of the Pohnpei region. Pingelap is at the eastern edge of the map.]]
The first European observer of the islands was Captain Thomas Musgrave in the ship {{ship||Sugar Cane|1786 ship|2}}. Captain MacAskill in {{ship||Lady Barlow|1803 ship|2}} revisited them in 1809. Errors in measurement of their location resulted in the islands being separately named on charts in the 19th century as the Musgrave Islands and the MacAskill islands, within the Caroline archipelago.<ref>Findlay (1851), Vol. 2, p. 1076.</ref><ref>Brigham (1900), Vol. 1, issue 2, p. 131.</ref>

Historically, the ''Ouwa'' or the Paramount Chief or King of Pikelap which is a hereditary title that granted supreme rule of the land, ruled the island of Pikelap which is now known as Pingelap. Japan seized the atoll in October 1914, following the start of [[World War I]]. The hereditary system remained in place during Japanese rule, although the title was renamed \"Island Magistrate\". 

Japan used the southern part of Pingelap Island during hostilities in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]] for a supply base. [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] later attacked it. The presence of foreign troops on the island led to the introduction of a number of infectious diseases, including [[gonorrhoea]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[dysentery]], which reduced the population from its pre-war level of around 1000 to 800, and decreased the [[fertility rate]] significantly.<ref name=\"book\"/>

The arrival of the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1945 resulted in the setting up of a [[democracy|democratic]]ally elected system alongside the traditional system, which gradually weakened in power. Universal [[primary education]] was provided for Pingelapese children and a limited [[health care]] scheme was set up to eradicate the diseases introduced during the war.<ref name=\"book\"/>

During the 1960s, the [[Peace Corps]] and [[U.S. Air Force]] settled on the main island. The [[U.S. Air Force]] constructed a missile watching station in the northeast of the island and a pier, with work beginning in 1978 on an airstrip, jutting into the lagoon, on the main island.<ref name=\"book\"/> The runway was finished in 1982, and currently [[Caroline Islands]] Air makes two or three flights daily to and from the atoll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intangible.org/Features/micronesia/text/Pon3.html|title=Micronesian Diary: Pingelap, Phonpei|publisher=intangible.org|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>

== Climate ==

Pingelap enjoys a tropical climate, with even, warm temperatures throughout the year.

Precipitation is generally plentiful, with heavy year-round rainfall.

==Total color blindness==

A significant proportion of the population has [[achromatopsia#Complete achromatopsia|complete achromatopsia]] due to total absence of working cones in their eye retinas, leaving them with only rods, a [[recessive gene|recessive]] [[genetic disorder]] that causes total color blindness in sufferers. This condition is known on the island as ''maskun'', meaning literally \"not see\" in Pingelapese.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pingelap and Mokil Atolls: historical genetics|first=N.E.|last=Morton|first2=I.E.|last2=Hussels|first3=R.|last3= Lew|first4=G.F.|last4=Little|year=1972|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=24|pages=277–289|pmid=4537352|issue=3|pmc=1762283}}</ref><ref name=\"Hussels 1972 304–309\">{{cite journal|title=Pingelap and Mokil Atolls: achromatopsia|first=I.E.|last=Hussels|first2=N.E.|last2= Mortons|year=1972|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=24|pages=304–309|pmid=4555088|issue=3|pmc=1762260}}</ref>

Complete achromatopsia is normally a very rare condition, and its prevalence on the island has been traced back to a [[population bottleneck]] in 1775 after a catastrophic typhoon swept through the island, leaving only about 20 survivors. One of these, Doahkaesa Mwanenihsed (the ruler at that time), is now believed to have been a carrier for the underlying genetic condition, but the achromatopsia disorder did not appear until the fourth generation after the typhoon, by which time 2.7% of the Pingelapese were affected. Since achromatopsia is an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder, inbreeding between the descendants of Doahkaesa Mwanenised would result in an increased recessive allele frequency.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of genetics|volume=2ed|title=Inbreeding and Assortive Mating|first=Paul R.|last=Cabe|year=2004}}</ref> By generation six, the incidence rose to approximately 4.9%,<ref name=\"Hussels 1972 304–309\"/> due to the [[founder effect]] and [[inbreeding]], with all achromats on the island nowadays tracing their ancestry to Doahkaesa Mwanenihsed.

Today the atoll is still of particular interest to [[geneticist]]s; due to the small [[gene pool]] and rapid population growth, the disorder is now prevalent in almost 10% of the population, with a further 30% being unaffected carriers. (By comparison, in the [[United States]], only 1 in 33,000, or 0.003%, are affected).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achromatopsia.org/|title=The Achromatopsia Group|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> Leading neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]]'s 1997 book ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]''<ref>{{cite book|title=The Island of the Colour-blind|first=Oliver|last=Sacks|authorlink=Oliver Sacks|year=1997|publisher=[[Picador (imprint)|Picador]]|isbn=0-330-35887-1}}</ref> references the island.

It is reported that one Pingelapese island sea-fisherman with this condition has difficulty seeing in bright sunlight, but at night can see in much fainter light than people with normal vision can; he uses this ability in a boat at night waving a large [[burning torch]] about to attract or confuse [[flying fish]], which he then catches; the flying fish act as if the torch is the moon.<ref>[[BBCTV2]] program \"''[[Countdown to Life, the Extraordinary Making of You]]''\", part 3, 28 September 2015</ref> The commentator said that in his brain, brain capacity intended to process cone signals is instead added to his rod signal processing capacity. Most of the islanders say they \"see\" red the most prominently; they have a fondness for green as a symbolic love for nature and vegetation, despite never having seen the color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/sanne-de-wilde-island-of-the-colorblind/index.html|title='Island of the Colorblind': Where the jungle is pink, the sea is gray and the light is far too bright|first=Dalya |last=Alberge|website=CNN|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

Historically, the ''Ouwa'' or the Paramount Chief or King of Pikelap which is a hereditary title that granted supreme rule of the land, ruled the island of Pikelap which is now known as Pingelap. Japan seized the atoll in October 1914, following the start of [[World War I]]. The hereditary system remained in place during Japanese rule, although the title was renamed \"Island Magistrate\". 

Japan used the southern part of Pingelap Island during hostilities in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]] for a supply base. [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] later attacked it. The presence of foreign troops on the island led to the introduction of a number of infectious diseases, including [[gonorrhoea]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[dysentery]], which reduced the population from its pre-war level of around 1000 to 800, and decreased the [[fertility rate]] significantly.<ref name=\"book\"/>

The arrival of the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1945 resulted in the setting up of a [[democracy|democratic]]ally elected system alongside the traditional system, which gradually weakened in power. Universal [[primary education]] was provided for Pingelapese children and a limited [[health care]] scheme was set up to eradicate the diseases introduced during the war.<ref name=\"book\"/>

During the 1960s, the [[Peace Corps]] and [[U.S. Air Force]] settled on the main island. The [[U.S. Air Force]] constructed a missile watching station in the northeast of the island and a pier, with work beginning in 1978 on an airstrip, jutting into the lagoon, on the main island.<ref name=\"book\"/> The runway was finished in 1982, and currently [[Caroline Islands]] Air makes two or three flights daily to and from the atoll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intangible.org/Features/micronesia/text/Pon3.html|title=Micronesian Diary: Pingelap, Phonpei|publisher=intangible.org|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>

== Climate ==

Pingelap enjoys a tropical climate, with even, warm temperatures throughout the year.

Precipitation is generally plentiful, with heavy year-round rainfall.

==Total color blindness==

A significant proportion of the population has [[achromatopsia#Complete achromatopsia|complete achromatopsia]] due to total absence of working cones in their eye retinas, leaving them with only rods, a [[recessive gene|recessive]] [[genetic disorder]] that causes total color blindness in sufferers. This condition is known on the island as ''maskun'', meaning literally \"not see\" in Pingelapese.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pingelap and Mokil Atolls: historical genetics|first=N.E.|last=Morton|first2=I.E.|last2=Hussels|first3=R.|last3= Lew|first4=G.F.|last4=Little|year=1972|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=24|pages=277–289|pmid=4537352|issue=3|pmc=1762283}}</ref><ref name=\"Hussels 1972 304–309\">{{cite journal|title=Pingelap and Mokil Atolls: achromatopsia|first=I.E.|last=Hussels|first2=N.E.|last2= Mortons|year=1972|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=24|pages=304–309|pmid=4555088|issue=3|pmc=1762260}}</ref>

Complete achromatopsia is normally a very rare condition, and its prevalence on the island has been traced back to a [[population bottleneck]] in 1775 after a catastrophic typhoon swept through the island, leaving only about 20 survivors. One of these, Doahkaesa Mwanenihsed (the ruler at that time), is now believed to have been a carrier for the underlying genetic condition, but the achromatopsia disorder did not appear until the fourth generation after the typhoon, by which time 2.7% of the Pingelapese were affected. Since achromatopsia is an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder, inbreeding between the descendants of Doahkaesa Mwanenised would result in an increased recessive allele frequency.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of genetics|volume=2ed|title=Inbreeding and Assortive Mating|first=Paul R.|last=Cabe|year=2004}}</ref> By generation six, the incidence rose to approximately 4.9%,<ref name=\"Hussels 1972 304–309\"/> due to the [[founder effect]] and [[inbreeding]], with all achromats on the island nowadays tracing their ancestry to Doahkaesa Mwanenihsed.

Today the atoll is still of particular interest to [[geneticist]]s; due to the small [[gene pool]] and rapid population growth, the disorder is now prevalent in almost 10% of the population, with a further 30% being unaffected carriers. (By comparison, in the [[United States]], only 1 in 33,000, or 0.003%, are affected).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achromatopsia.org/|title=The Achromatopsia Group|accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> Leading neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]]'s 1997 book ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]''<ref>{{cite book|title=The Island of the Colour-blind|first=Oliver|last=Sacks|authorlink=Oliver Sacks|year=1997|publisher=[[Picador (imprint)|Picador]]|isbn=0-330-35887-1}}</ref> references the island.

It is reported that one Pingelapese island sea-fisherman with this condition has difficulty seeing in bright sunlight, but at night can see in much fainter light than people with normal vision can; he uses this ability in a boat at night waving a large [[burning torch]] about to attract or confuse [[flying fish]], which he then catches; the flying fish act as if the torch is the moon.<ref>[[BBCTV2]] program \"''[[Countdown to Life, the Extraordinary Making of You]]''\", part 3, 28 September 2015</ref> The commentator said that in his brain, brain capacity intended to process cone signals is instead added to his rod signal processing capacity. Most of the islanders say they \"see\" red the most prominently; they have a fondness for green as a symbolic love for nature and vegetation, despite never having seen the color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/sanne-de-wilde-island-of-the-colorblind/index.html|title='Island of the Colorblind': Where the jungle is pink, the sea is gray and the light is far too bright|last=CNN|first=Dalya Alberge|website=CNN|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

As an object with three dimensions, Dirac cones are a feature of [[two-dimensional materials]] or surface states, based on a linear [[dispersion relation]] between energy and the two components of the [[crystal momentum]] k<sub>x</sub> and k<sub>y</sub>. However, this concept can be extended to three dimensions, where '''Dirac semimetals''' are defined by a linear dispersion relation between energy and k<sub>x</sub>, k<sub>y</sub>, and k<sub>z</sub>. In k-space, this shows up as a [[hypercone]], which have doubly degenerate bands which also meet at Dirac points. Dirac semimetals contain both time reversal and spatial inversion symmetry; when one of these is broken, the Dirac points are split into two constituent [[Weyl semimetal|Weyl point]]s, and the material becomes a Weyl semimetal.

[[File:Northern Pakistan 18.JPG|thumb|left|A view over the town]]
Naran has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Koppen Climate Classification]] ''Dfb'').<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\"/> There is significant rainfall in summers and heavy snowfall in winters. However the trend is changing due to climate change within the region, and for the past few years, Naran is receiving lesser snowfall. It is advisable to visit Naran in the month of January to watch and enjoy snow falling there. It is a famous summer destination for people who come here from within Pakistan and abroad to enjoy the weather. The temperature, though, is rising. A few years back, Naran was only accessible in June, but for a few years, accessibility is improving, and the roads are drive-able even in early spring. Naran remains busy in summer, starting earlier, and tourism is extending up to late in the fall. The average annual temperature in Naran is 10.1 °C. The region is Alpine in geography and climate, with forests and meadows dominating the landscape below peaks that reach over 17,000 feet.

[[File:Burawai near Naran.jpg|thumb|left|The surrounding Kaghan Valley]]
[[File:Northern Pakistan 18.JPG|thumb|left|A view over the town]]
Naran has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Koppen Climate Classification]] ''Dfb'').<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\"/> There is significant rainfall in summers and heavy snowfall in winters. However the trend is changing due to climate change within the region, and for the past few years, Naran is receiving lesser snowfall. It is advisable to visit Naran in the month of January to watch and enjoy snow falling there. It is a famous summer destination for people who come here from within Pakistan and abroad to enjoy the weather. The temperature, though, is rising. A few years back, Naran was only accessible in June, but for a few years, accessibility is improving, and the roads are drive-able even in early spring. Naran remains busy in summer, starting earlier, and tourism is extending up to late in the fall. The average annual temperature in Naran is 10.1 °C. The region is Alpine in geography and climate, with forests and meadows dominating the landscape below peaks that reach over 17,000 feet.

Sarah Brown died on January 24, 1917, after celebrating the couple's Golden Wedding anniversary on January 1 of that year. She was eulogized by her husband as being a \"person of great executive ability and force of character.\"

Brown had a lifelong interest in agricultural matters. He managed and worked one of the largest and most productive farms in [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham County]]. His farm included orchards, salt marsh, dairy cattle, sheep and gardens sufficient to maintain his family and the employees for whom he provided room and board.

Brown was president of the [[New Hampshire State Agricultural Society]] for eleven years, treasurer of the [[New England Agricultural Society]] for twenty-five years, trustee of the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] for 24 years, including four years served as Chairman of the Board.

In addition to agricultural interests, Brown was active in state politics. He was a state senator in 1872–73, a member of the state's [[Executive Council of New Hampshire|Executive Council]] from 1879 to 1881 during the term of [[Nathaniel Head|Natt Head]] as Governor, and a delegate to the [[1884 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref name=WB75/> He was a state representative in 1887, and a presidential elector in [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]]. He was also a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].<ref name=WB75/> Brown was a stockholder and active promoter of the electric railways in southern New Hampshire,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48628773/stockholders-elected-at-portsmouth/ |title=Stockholders Elected at Portsmouth |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=12 |date=November 26, 1900 |accessdate=April 13, 2020 |via=newspapers.com}}</ref> and owned and operated a sawmill on his estate.

Brown was a true native son, descended from many of the original settlers of the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|New Hampshire Seacoast Region]], and very interested in his town's history. He wrote a two-volume history of Hampton Falls: ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume I'' and ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume II''. Volume I spans from 1640 to 1900, while Volume II spans from 1900 to 1917.

===Death===
Brown died September 19, 1919.  He was buried in the family lot in the Westview Cemetery of Hampton Falls. He was predeceased by his wife Sarah, his daughter Gertrude and his son Harry.

==Residence==
[[File:Sunnyside_residence_of_Warren_Brown_(politician).png|thumb|right|Brown's residence, Sunnyside, as published in his ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H.'']]
Brown owned and operated a highly successful farm on family land purchased by his father in 1812. On this property, in 1880, he built a [[Victorian house|Victorian style home]] which replaced his parents' center-chimney [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] house. This new home, called Sunnyside, was designed by his beloved wife Sarah Gertrude; architectural plans were drawn for her by a Mr. Bruce of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].  The house remained in the family until the 1960s.  Its unique presence in a town of mainly colonial styled architecture, its resemblance to [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'']] house and the years between owners when it was vacant, have perhaps helped to make it the source of speculation by locals and newcomers alike.

For many years, a rumor circulated stating that Brown made an unsuccessful run for [[Governor of New Hampshire]] and that his Victorian style house was built in anticipation of its being \"the Governor's mansion\", a name it became known by. In truth, his wife Sarah, a woman of innovation and industry, designed Sunnyside to be a practical and beautiful home where the couple could entertain in style and operate their large estate with efficiently. After numerous experiences, the current owners have brought in many paranormal teams to prove spectral activity on this property and had it investigated in 2012 by [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] ( T.A.P.S.) for the [[Syfy]] television series [[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|''Ghost Hunters'']].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20160414/NEWS/160419448 |title=‘Haunted in New England’ to film at Hampton Falls mansion |first=Max |last=Sullivan |website=seacoastonline.com |date=April 14, 2016 |accessdate=April 12, 2020 |quote=The home was built around 1880 by Warren Brown, a prominent New Hampshire politician.}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Brown Road, abutting his former property in Hampton Falls, is named for Warren Brown.

On April 17, 2006, a group of Hampton Falls people formed the Warren Brown Foundation and created a website. The Foundation was dedicated to \"discovering the Brown family's past and improving what is left.\" The group has since been discontinued as it was the act of uninformed newcomers who discovered the family had not disappeared into obscurity.  Many of Warren and Sarah Brown's descendants still live in the greater Hampton Falls area and take umbrage at the rewriting of their family's history.

'''Donaueschingen''' is a [[Germany|German]] town in the [[Black Forest]] in the southwest of the [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] in the [[Schwarzwald-Baar]] [[Districts of Germany|''Kreis'']]. It stands near the confluence of the two sources of the river [[Danube]] (in {{lang-de|Donau}}; the town's name is an [[eponym]]).

Donaueschingen stands in a [[Drainage basin|basin]] within low mountainous terrain. It is located about {{convert|13|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Villingen-Schwenningen]], {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Tuttlingen]], and about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} north of the Swiss town of [[Schaffhausen]]. In 2015 the population was 21,750, making it the second largest town in the district (''Kreis'') of Schwarzwald-Baar. It is a regional rail hub.

==Geography==
Donaueschingen lies in the [[Baar (region)|Baar]] basin in the southern [[Black Forest]] at the confluence of the [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] rivers— the two source tributaries of the [[Danube]]— from which the town gets its name. This is today considered the true source of the Danube.

[[File:Donauquelle 4168.jpg|thumb|right|Source of the Donaubach in Donaueschingen (historically considered the source of the Danube)]]

Donaueschingen is first recorded as ''Esginga'' in 889; the modern form of the name is first attested in 1292.<ref>Berger, Dieter, ''Duden. Geographische Names in Deutschland'', 2nd edition, Duden 1999.</ref> In 1283, [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph von Habsburg]] granted the principality of Baar and Donaueschingen to Heinrich von [[Fürstenberg (state)|Fürstenberg]]. The right to brew beer was also connected with this grant. This is the source of the [[Royal Fürstenberg Brewery]]. In 1488, possession was passed to the Count of [[Fürstenberg-Baar]]. From the 18th Century it was the residence of the [[Fürstenberg-Fürstenberg|Princes of Fürstenberg]]. In 1806, Donaueschingen came under the rule of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] and was granted township in 1810. A large part of the town was destroyed by fire in 1908. Donaueschingen has a tradition as a military garrison; since [[World War II]] the [[French military]] has maintained barracks in the town, and, until the early 1990s, the [[U.S. Air Force]] operated a contingency hospital there. The hospital never received casualties on a large scale from military operations; it saw the most activity in 1989, when the [[United States]] offered the facility as temporary housing for refugees leaving from [[East Germany]] to the West.

Though the Princes of Fürstenberg were nominally [[German Mediatisation|mediatised]] and deposed as absolute ruler of the principality, they still own huge property in their former lands, including their palace with the surrounding parks and gardens. The Schlosspark (palace gardens) which used to be public and the only park accessible to the citizens of the town since 1806 recently became off-limits again. The Princes of Fürstenberg were also the owners of an important manuscript of the [[Nibelungenlied]] (Manuscript C) until they sold it in 2001. The ancestral brewery has also been sold.

The town's economy consists of nearly 1,000 various enterprises, of which 24 are medium-sized employing 2,200 people. The most important industries are machine assembly, [[semiconductors]], [[injection moulding]], magnetics, [[dyes]], and shoe manufacturing.

===Transport===
[[Donaueschingen station]] is a regional rail hub; four rail lines join in the town. It sits on the [[Black Forest Railway (Baden)|Schwarzwaldbahn]] line from [[Offenburg]] to [[Konstanz]] and it is the start of the [[Höllentalbahn (Black Forest)|Höllentalbahn]] from Donaueschingen to [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. Both of these lines are uniquely constructed because of the rough Black Forest terrain they cover. Donaueschingen is also the starting point for the [[Danube Valley Railway (Baden-Württemberg)|Donautalbahn]] and the [[Bregtalbahn]], which run to [[Ulm]] and [[Bräunlingen]] respectively. The town is part of the Schwarzwald-Baar public transport system.

The town is on the A 864, a spur of the A 81 to [[Stuttgart]]. Three federal highways meet in the vicinity of Donaueschingen: the B 27 from Stuttgart to Schaffhausen; the B 31 from Freiburg im Breisgau to Lindau and the B 33 from Offenburg to Konstanz.

'''Donaueschingen''' is a [[Germany|German]] town in the [[Black Forest]] in the southwest of the [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] in the [[Schwarzwald-Baar]] [[Districts of Germany|''Kreis'']]. It stands near the confluence of the two sources of the river [[Danube]] (in {{lang-de|Donau}}; the town's name is an [[eponym]]).

Donaueschingen stands in a [[Drainage basin|basin]] within low mountainous terrain. It is located about {{convert|13|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Villingen-Schwenningen]], {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Tuttlingen]], and about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} north of the Swiss town of [[Schaffhausen]]. In 2015 the population was 21,750, making it the second largest town in the district (''Kreis'') of Schwarzwald-Baar. It is a regional rail hub.

== Geography ==
Donaueschingen lies in the [[Baar (region)|Baar]] basin in the southern [[Black Forest]] at the confluence of the [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] rivers— the two source tributaries of the [[Danube]]— from which the town gets its name. This is today considered the true source of the Danube.

[[File:Donauquelle 4168.jpg|thumb|right|Source of the Donaubach in Donaueschingen (historically considered the source of the Danube)]]
An enclosed [[karst spring]] on the castle grounds, the source of the \"Donaubach\", is known as the [[source of the Danube]].

The municipal area extends continuously from the [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] of the Black Forest through the [[Triassic]] formations of the Schwarzwald-Baar [[talus slope|talus]] to the [[Swabian Alb]], and exhibits all [[strata]] of the southern German [[cuesta]] country. The heights decrease from {{convert|1020|m|ft}} in the Black Forest to about {{convert|660|m|ft}} on the Baar plateau, then increase to above the {{convert|900|m|ft}} mark again at the Swabian Alb. A model showing the extraordinary geological setting of the city and its surrounding region is located in the park opposite the train station.

The town is close to Lake [[Titisee]] and less than an hour's drive from both [[Switzerland]] and [[France]].

→‎Loyalties and the exiled Queen:typo,safe,Unoquha,"[[File:Lochend House.jpg|thumb|Robert Logan's home, '''Lochend Castle''' at [[Restalrig]]]]
'''Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig''' (c.1555-July 1606) was a Scottish knight involved in the [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie|Gowrie House affair of 1600]].

==Family backgound==
Robert Logan's father and grandfather were also called \"Robert Logan of Restalrig\".

In 1547, his grandfather, Robert Logan of Restalrig was married to Margaret Seton.<ref>''HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling'' (London, 1878), p. 648 no. 18.</ref>

Robert's father was also called \"Robert Logan of Restalrig\", his mother was Agnes Gray, daughter of [[Patrick Gray, 4th Lord Gray]].  During the crisis of the [[Scottish reformation]] in 1559, this Robert Logan senior took his [[Leith]] followers to face the French troops of [[Henri Cleutin]] at [[Cupar Muir]].<ref>Knox, John, ''Works: History of the Reformation'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 350-5.</ref> Later he advised against resistance at Leith by the Protestant [[Lords of the Congregation]] against the French troops of [[Mary of Guise]], which led to a short-lived truce by the terms of the [[articles of Leith]].

After Robert Logan senior died, his widow Agnes Gray married [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home]]. Robert the heir firstly married Elizabeth Makgill, daughter of David Makgill of Cranston-Riddell, then Jonet Ker and thirdly Marion Ker.<ref>''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland: 1580-1593'' (Edinburgh, 1888), nos. 436, 1014: Douglas, William, ''PSAS'' (1927), pp. 27-35.</ref> Robert's first wife, Elizabeth Makgill, after their divorce, married Sir Thomas Kennedy of [[Culzean Castle|Culzean]], [[John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis|Tutor of Cassilis]].

A daughter was christened at Fast Castle in May 1590 attended by the [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]] and [[Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home|Lord Home]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 297.</ref>

===Logan properties===
[[File:Fastcastle.jpg|thumb|19th-century engraving of '''Fast Castle''', involved in Robert's plot to adbduct [[James VI of Scotland]]]]
The Logan family lived at [[Lochend Castle]] near [[Restalrig]], and others of the name had been Provost of Leith. In 1430, an ancestor, also called Sir Robert Logan (d. 1439), and his wife Dame Katherine founded the monastery of St Anthony which was near [[South Leith Parish Church]] with an outlying chapel at [[Arthur's Seat]] in [[Holyrood Park]], which survives as a ruin.<ref>Roger, Charles, ''Historical Notices of St Anthony's Monastery, Leith and Reheasal of Events'' (Grampian Club, 1877), pp. 7, 28.</ref>

Robert inherited [[Fast Castle]] and other lands near the border with England, as 'nephew' and heir of Elizabeth Martene, Lady Fastcastle, widow of Cuthbert Home who had fallen at [[Flodden Field]]. In the 1570s Robert was lord of half of the lands of Fastcastle, and Sir George Ogilvie of Dunlugus was lord of the other half.

In 1597 he surrendered a number of lands and rights connected to Fast Castle (but not the Castle itself), which he had inherited from George Ogilvy of Dunlugus, to the Hume of [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]] family. The rights included the keeping of [[Berwick Castle]], which had not been in [[capture of Berwick (1482)|Scottish hands since 1482]].<ref>''HMC Milne Home of Wedderburn'' (London, 1902), p. 64.</ref> Fast Castle had been a possession of Coldingham Priory, but after 1598 the lands of the Priory were annexed to the crown, and so Logan now held Fastcastle and Flemington directly from the crown. On 5 April 1603, [[James VI of Scotland]] raised the status of the Restalrig estate into a free barony, which gave Robert extra jurisdictions over his tenants.<ref>''HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling'' (London, 1878), p. 648 nos. 18, 24.</ref>

==Loyalties and the exiled Queen==
During the [[Marian Civil War|Scottish civil war]] in 1573, Robert Logan supported [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] by joining [[William Kirkcaldy of Grange]] in defending [[Edinburgh Castle]] in the Queen's name. On 29 July 1586, he wrote from Restalrig to [[Archibald Douglas, Parson of Douglas|Archibald Douglas]] in London, offering his service to [[Francis Walsingham]]. Logan conveyed letters secretly from England for the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Gray]].<ref>''HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield'', vol. 3 (London, 1889), nos. 312, 489.</ref>

James VI had hoped that Archibald Douglas, a Scotsman resident in London, but not an accredited ambassador, might be able to intervene and save his mother from execution after the revelation of the [[Babington plot]] in 1586. The Master of Gray and Logan corresponded with Douglas on this unofficial diplomacy. The Master of Gray's letters show that he was reluctant to become involved in a project with such doubtful outcomes, but he sent Logan to Douglas in December 1586. After he returned to Fast Castle, Logan wrote back to Douglas on 25 February 1587. By now Mary had been executed and James VI was angry with Gray's actions, and Logan told Douglas not to write to Gray anymore:<blockquote>\"he wryt to me, desirenge me to wryt to your Lordship that ye shuld wryt no moir to hem, for your letters doithe hem very muche harme, and he was no thenge the wisar of your intelligens. It is indeid of treuthe that the Kinge is in greit anger at you and altogither be Williame Keithe and James Hetson's informatioune, and thinks ye have done hem wronge... His Majesty taks the daithe of his mother very hevely, and hes, for that cause, retirit hemself to Dalkethe for the space of 10 days in quyet.\"<br><br>Modernised: \"he wrote to me, desiring me to write to your lordship that you should write no more to him, for your letters do him very much harm, and he was nothing the wiser from your intelligence. It is indeed of truth that the King is in great anger at you, and altogether by [[William Keith of Delny|William Keith]] and James Hudson's information, and thinks you have done him wrong  ... His Majesty takes the death of his mother very heavily, and has for that cause, retired himself to [[Dalkeith Palace]] for the space of 10 days in quiet.\"<ref>Lodge, Edmund, ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 2 (London, 1791), pp. 338-9 no. 211.</ref></blockquote>

Robert Logan died before May 1608, the last of his line.<ref>''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland'', vol. 6, no. 2078.</ref> His first wife, Elizabeth MacGill, after their divorce married Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean, [[John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis|Tutor of Cassilis]].

==Logan and the Gowrie House affair==
Robert Logan was implicated in an alleged attempt to abduct [[James VI of Scotland]] by [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie]], at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] on 4 August 1600, by the confession of George Sprot of [[Eyemouth]]. In 1608, after Robert Logan's death, Sprot confessed he had seen letters from Gowrie to Logan at Fast Castle and Gunnisgreen. Sprot understood from Logan's servant that if the king was successfully abducted, Logan would be rewarded with the gift of [[Dirleton Castle]].

Sprot described a letter signed \"Restalrig\" which he claimed was written by Robert Logan to Gowrie, which he had obtained from Logan's illiterate servant, James Bour of [[Auchencrow]]. Logan offered Gowrie and his brother the use of Fast Castle to settle their plot. He recommended that \"the matter\" be settled soon at the King's buck hunting. In this letter, Robert said the matter in hand was like a strange tale of a gentleman of Padua.

George Sprot was hanged at the Market Cross of [[Edinburgh]] for foreknowledge of the conspiracy on 12 August 1608.<ref>Scott, Walter, ed., ''Secret History of the Court of James the First'', vol. 2 (Ballantyne: Edinburgh, 1811), 118-135, reprinting ''Aulicus Coquinariae'' (1650).</ref> The story was doubted at the time, Sprot having first withdrawn his confession, [[John Spottiswoode]] who was present at Sprot's hanging thought his tale, \"a meer invention of the man's own brain.\" Spottiswoode did not think it likely that Gowrie would have plotted with Logan.<ref>''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1887), pp. 150-152 footnote.</ref> George Sprot had been connected with Logan, if only because the lawyer had signed as a witness to some of Logan's property transactions.<ref>''HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling'' (London, 1878), p. 648 no. 25.</ref>

In 1609 the Logan family had their lands and properties forfeited by the [[Parliament of Scotland]]<ref>https://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?action=print&id=12335&filename=jamesvi_trans&type=trans</ref>, including Logan of Restalrig's eldest son, also called Robert. The records of Parliament include the text of five alleged letters from Robert to Gowrie. The Kirk Minister of Coldingham, Alexander Watson, testified that the spelling and hand of the letters was that of Logan. Watson made detailed comment on the habits of Logan's [[orthography]].<ref>''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1816), pp. 419-428.</ref>

Robert's father was also called \"Robert Logan of Restalrig\", his mother was Agnes Gray, daughter of [[Patrick Gray, 4th Lord Gray]].  During the crisis of the [[Scottish reformation]] in 1559, this Robert Logan senior took his [[Leith]] followers to face the French troops of [[Henri Cleutin]] at [[Cupar Muir]].<ref>Knox, John, ''Works: History of the Reformation'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 350-5.</ref> Later he advised against resistance at Leith by the Protestant [[Lords of the Congregation]] against the French troops of [[Mary of Guise]], which led to a short-lived truce by the terms of the [[articles of Leith]].

After Robert Logan senior died, his widow Agnes Gray married [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home]]. Robert the heir firstly married Elizabeth Makgill, daughter of David Makgill of Cranston-Riddell, then Jonet Ker and thirdly Marion Ker.<ref>''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland: 1580-1593'' (Edinburgh, 1888), nos. 436, 1014: Douglas, William, ''PSAS'' (1927), pp. 27-35.</ref> Robert's first wife, Elizabeth Makgill, after their divorce, married Sir Thomas Kennedy of [[Culzean Castle|Culzean]], [[John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis|Tutor of Cassilis]].

A daughter was christened at Fast Castle in May 1590 attended by the [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]] and [[Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home|Lord Home]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 297.</ref>

===Logan properties===
[[File:Fastcastle.jpg|thumb|19th-century engraving of '''Fast Castle''', involved in Robert's plot to adbduct [[James VI of Scotland]]]]
The Logan family lived at [[Lochend Castle]] near [[Restalrig]], and others of the name had been Provost of Leith. In 1430, an ancestor, also called Sir Robert Logan (d. 1439), and his wife Dame Katherine founded the monastery of St Anthony which was near [[South Leith Parish Church]] with an outlying chapel at [[Arthur's Seat]] in [[Holyrood Park]], which survives as a ruin.<ref>Roger, Charles, ''Historical Notices of St Anthony's Monastery, Leith and Reheasal of Events'' (Grampian Club, 1877), pp. 7, 28.</ref>

Robert inherited [[Fast Castle]] and other lands near the border with England, as 'nephew' and heir of Elizabeth Martene, Lady Fastcastle, widow of Cuthbert Home who had fallen at [[Flodden Field]]. In the 1570s Robert was lord of half of the lands of Fastcastle, and Sir George Ogilvie of Dunlugus was lord of the other half.

In 1597 he surrendered a number of lands and rights connected to Fast Castle (but not the Castle itself), which he had inherited from George Ogilvy of Dunlugus, to the Hume of [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]] family. The rights included the keeping of [[Berwick Castle]], which had not been in [[capture of Berwick (1482)|Scottish hands since 1482]].<ref>''HMC Milne Home of Wedderburn'' (London, 1902), p. 64.</ref> Fast Castle had been a possession of Coldingham Priory, but after 1598 the lands of the Priory were annexed to the crown, and so Logan now held Fastcastle and Flemington directly from the crown. On 5 April 1603, [[James VI of Scotland]] raised the status of the Restalrig estate into a free barony, which gave Robert extra jurisdictions over his tenants.<ref>''HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling'' (London, 1878), p. 648 nos. 18, 24.</ref>

==Loyalties and the exiled Queen==
During the [[Marian Civil War|Scottish civil war]] in 1573, Robert Logan supported [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] by joining [[William Kirkcaldy of Grange]] in defending [[Edinburgh Castle]] in the Queen's name. On 29 July 1586, he wrote from Restalrig to [[Archibald Douglas, Parson of Douglas|Archibald Douglas]] in London, offering his service to [[Francis Walsingham]]. Logan conveyed letters secretly from England for the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Gray]].<ref>''HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield'', vol. 3 (London, 1889), nos. 312, 489.</ref>

James VI had hoped that Archibald Douglas, a Scotsman resident in London, but not an accredited ambassador, might be able to intervene and save his mother from execution after the revelation of the [[Babington plot]] in 1586. The Master of Gray and Logan corresponded with Douglas on this unofficial diplomacy. The Master of Gray's letters show that he was reluctant to become involved in a project with such doubtful outcomes, but he sent Logan to Douglas in December 1586. After he returned to Fast Castle, Logan wrote back to Douglas on 25 February 1587. By now Mary had been executed and James VI was angry with Gray's actions, and Restalrig told Douglas not to write to Gray anymore:<blockquote>\"he wryt to me, desirenge me to wryt to your Lordship that ye shuld wryt no moir to hem, for your letters doithe hem very muche harme, and he was no thenge the wisar of your intelligens. It is indeid of treuthe that the Kinge is in greit anger at you and altogither be Williame Keith]e and James Hetson's informatioune, and thinks ye have done hem wronge... His Majesty taks the daithe of his mother very hevely, and hes, for that cause, retirit hemself to Dalkethe for the space of 10 days in quyet.\"<br><br>Modernised: \"he wrote to me, desiring me to write to your lordship that you should write no more to him, for your letters do him very much harm, and he was nothing the wiser from your intelligence. It is indeed of truth that the King is in great anger at you, and altogether by [[William Keith of Delny|William Keith]] and James Hudson's information, and thinks you have done him wrong  ... His Majesty takes the death of his mother very heavily, and has for that cause, retired himself to [[Dalkeith Palace]] for the space of 10 days in quiet.\"<ref>Lodge, Edmund, ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 2 (London, 1791), pp. 338-9 no. 211.</ref></blockquote>

Robert Logan died before May 1608, the last of his line.<ref>''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland'', vol. 6, no. 2078.</ref> His first wife, Elizabeth MacGill, after their divorce married Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean, [[John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis|Tutor of Cassilis]].

==Logan and the Gowrie House affair==
Robert Logan was implicated in an alleged attempt to abduct [[James VI of Scotland]] by [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie]], at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] on 4 August 1600, by the confession of George Sprot of [[Eyemouth]]. In 1608, after Robert Logan's death, Sprot confessed he had seen letters from Gowrie to Logan at Fast Castle and Gunnisgreen. Sprot understood from Logan's servant that if the king was successfully abducted, Logan would be rewarded with the gift of [[Dirleton Castle]].

Sprot described a letter signed \"Restalrig\" which he claimed was written by Robert Logan to Gowrie, which he had obtained from Logan's illiterate servant, James Bour of [[Auchencrow]]. Logan offered Gowrie and his brother the use of Fast Castle to settle their plot. He recommended that \"the matter\" be settled soon at the King's buck hunting. In this letter, Robert said the matter in hand was like a strange tale of a gentleman of Padua.

George Sprot was hanged at the Market Cross of [[Edinburgh]] for foreknowledge of the conspiracy on 12 August 1608.<ref>Scott, Walter, ed., ''Secret History of the Court of James the First'', vol. 2 (Ballantyne: Edinburgh, 1811), 118-135, reprinting ''Aulicus Coquinariae'' (1650).</ref> The story was doubted at the time, Sprot having first withdrawn his confession, [[John Spottiswoode]] who was present at Sprot's hanging thought his tale, \"a meer invention of the man's own brain.\" Spottiswoode did not think it likely that Gowrie would have plotted with Logan.<ref>''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1887), pp. 150-152 footnote.</ref> George Sprot had been connected with Logan, if only because the lawyer had signed as a witness to some of Logan's property transactions.<ref>''HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling'' (London, 1878), p. 648 no. 25.</ref>

In 1609 the Logan family had their lands and properties forfeited by the [[Parliament of Scotland]]<ref>https://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?action=print&id=12335&filename=jamesvi_trans&type=trans</ref>, including Logan of Restalrig's eldest son, also called Robert. The records of Parliament include the text of five alleged letters from Robert to Gowrie. The Kirk Minister of Coldingham, Alexander Watson, testified that the spelling and hand of the letters was that of Logan. Watson made detailed comment on the habits of Logan's [[orthography]].<ref>''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1816), pp. 419-428.</ref>

'''All India Kisan Sabha''' (All India Peasants Union, also known as the ''Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha''), was the name of the peasants front of the  [[Communist Party of India]], an important [[peasant movement]] formed by [[Sahajanand Saraswati]] in 1936. It later split into two organisations known by the same name: [[All India Kisan Sabha (Ajoy Bhavan)|AIKS (Ajoy Bhavan)]] and [[All India Kisan Sabha (Ashoka Road)|AIKS (Ashoka Road)]].

==History==
The Kisan Sabha movement started in [[Bihar]] under the leadership of Sahajanand Saraswati who had formed in 1929 the [[Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha]] (BPKS) in order to mobilise peasant grievances against the [[zamindari]] attacks on their occupancy rights, and thus sparking the farmers' movements in India.<ref>{{cite book

'''Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig''' (c.1555-July 1606) was a Scottish knight involved in the [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie|Gowrie House affair of 1600]].

==Family backgound==
Robert Logan's father and grandfather were also called \"Robert Logan of Restalrig\".

In 1547, his grandfather, Robert Logan of Restalrig was married to Margaret Seton.<ref>''HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling'' (London, 1878), p. 648 no. 18.</ref>

Robert's father was also called \"Robert Logan of Restalrig\", his mother was Agnes Gray, daughter of [[Patrick Gray, 4th Lord Gray]].  During the crisis of the [[Scottish reformation]] in 1559, this Robert Logan senior took his [[Leith]] followers to face the French troops of [[Henri Cleutin]] at [[Cupar Muir]].<ref>Knox, John, ''Works: History of the Reformation'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 350-5.</ref> Later he advised against resistance at Leith by the Protestant [[Lords of the Congregation]] against the French troops of [[Mary of Guise]], which led to a short-lived truce by the terms of the [[articles of Leith]].

After Robert Logan senior died, his widow Agnes Gray married [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home]]. Robert the heir firstly married Elizabeth Makgill, daughter of David Makgill of Cranston-Riddell, then Jonet Ker and thirdly Marion Ker.<ref>''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland: 1580-1593'' (Edinburgh, 1888), nos. 436, 1014: Douglas, William, ''PSAS'' (1927), pp. 27-35.</ref> Robert's first wife, Elizabeth Makgill, after their divorce, married Sir Thomas Kennedy of [[Culzean Castle|Culzean]], [[John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis|Tutor of Cassilis]].

A daughter was christened at Fast Castle in May 1590 attended by the [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]] and [[Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home|Lord Home]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 297.</ref>

===Logan properties===
[[File:Fastcastle.jpg|thumb|19th-century engraving of '''Fast Castle''', involved in Robert's plot to adbduct [[James VI of Scotland]]]]
The Logan family lived at [[Lochend Castle]] near [[Restalrig]], and others of the name had been Provost of Leith. In 1430, an ancestor, also called Sir Robert Logan (d. 1439), and his wife Dame Katherine founded the monastery of St Anthony which was near [[South Leith Parish Church]] with an outlying chapel at [[Arthur's Seat]] in [[Holyrood Park]], which survives as a ruin.<ref>Roger, Charles, ''Historical Notices of St Anthony's Monastery, Leith and Reheasal of Events'' (Grampian Club, 1877), pp. 7, 28.</ref>

Robert inherited [[Fast Castle]] and other lands near the border with England, as 'nephew' and heir of Elizabeth Martene, Lady Fastcastle, widow of Cuthbert Home who had fallen at [[Flodden Field]]. In the 1570s Robert was lord of half of the lands of Fastcastle, and Sir George Ogilvie of Dunlugus was lord of the other half.

In 1597 he surrendered a number of lands and rights connected to Fast Castle (but not the Castle itself), which he had inherited from George Ogilvy of Dunlugus, to the Hume of [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]] family. The rights included the keeping of [[Berwick Castle]], which had not been in [[capture of Berwick (1482)|Scottish hands since 1482]].<ref>''HMC Milne Home of Wedderburn'' (London, 1902), p. 64.</ref> Fast Castle had been a possession of Coldingham Priory, but after 1598 the lands of the Priory were annexed to the crown, and so Logan now held Fastcastle and Flemington directly from the crown. On 5 April 1603, [[James VI of Scotland]] raised the status of the Restalrig estate into a free barony, which gave Robert extra jurisdictions over his tenants.<ref>''HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling'' (London, 1878), p. 648 nos. 18, 24.</ref>

==Loyalties and the exiled Queen==
During the [[Marian Civil War|Scottish civil war]] in 1573, Robert Logan supported [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] by joining [[William Kirkcaldy of Grange]] in defending [[Edinburgh Castle]] in the Queen's name. On 29 July 1586, he wrote from Restalrig to [[Archibald Douglas, Parson of Douglas|Archibald Douglas]] in London, offering his service to [[Francis Walsingham]]. Logan conveyed letters secretly from England for the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Gray]].<ref>''HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield'', vol. 3 (London, 1889), nos. 312, 489.</ref>

James VI had hoped that Archibald Douglas, a Scotsman resident in London, but not an accredited ambassador, might be able to intervene and save his mother from execution after the revelation of the [[Babington plot]] in 1586. The Master of Gray and Logan corresponded with Douglas on this unofficial diplomacy. The Master of Gray's letters show that he was reluctant to become involved in a project with such doubtful outcomes, but he sent Logan to Douglas in December 1586. After he returned to Fast Castle, Logan wrote back to Douglas on 25 February 1587. By now Mary had been executed and James VI was angry with Gray's actions, and Restalrig told Douglas not to write to Gray anymore:<blockquote>\"he wryt to me, desirenge me to wryt to your Lordship that ye shuld wryt no moir to hem, for your letters doithe hem very muche harme, and he was no thenge the wisar of your intelligens. It is indeid of treuthe that the Kinge is in greit anger at you and altogither be Williame Keith]e and James Hetson's informatioune, and thinks ye have done hem wronge... His Majesty taks the daithe of his mother very hevely, and hes, for that cause, retirit hemself to Dalkethe for the space of 10 days in quyet.\"<br><br>Modernised: \"he wrote to me, desiring me to write to your lordship that you should write no more to him, for your letters do him very much harm, and he was nothing the wiser from your intelligence. It is indeed of truth that the King is in great anger at you, and altogether by [[William Keith of Delny|William Keith]] and James Hudson's information, and thinks you have done him wrong  ... His Majesty takes the death of his mother very heavily, and has for that cause, retired himself to [[Dalkeith Palace]] for the space of 10 days in quiet.\"<ref>Lodge, Edmund, ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 2 (London, 1791), pp. 338-9 no. 211.</ref></blockquote>

Robert Logan died before May 1608, the last of his line.<ref>''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland'', vol. 6, no. 2078.</ref> His first wife, Elizabeth MacGill, after their divorce married Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean, [[John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis|Tutor of Cassilis]].

==Logan and the Gowrie House affair==
Robert Logan was implicated in an alleged attempt to abduct [[James VI of Scotland]] by [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie]], at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] on 4 August 1600, by the confession of George Sprot of [[Eyemouth]]. In 1608, after Robert Logan's death, Sprot confessed he had seen letters from Gowrie to Logan at Fast Castle and Gunnisgreen. Sprot understood from Logan's servant that if the king was successfully abducted, Logan would be rewarded with the gift of [[Dirleton Castle]].

Sprot described a letter signed \"Restalrig\" which he claimed was written by Robert Logan to Gowrie, which he had obtained from Logan's illiterate servant, James Bour of [[Auchencrow]]. Logan offered Gowrie and his brother the use of Fast Castle to settle their plot. He recommended that \"the matter\" be settled soon at the King's buck hunting. In this letter, Robert said the matter in hand was like a strange tale of a gentleman of Padua.

George Sprot was hanged at the Market Cross of [[Edinburgh]] for foreknowledge of the conspiracy on 12 August 1608.<ref>Scott, Walter, ed., ''Secret History of the Court of James the First'', vol. 2 (Ballantyne: Edinburgh, 1811), 118-135, reprinting ''Aulicus Coquinariae'' (1650).</ref> The story was doubted at the time, Sprot having first withdrawn his confession, [[John Spottiswoode]] who was present at Sprot's hanging thought his tale, \"a meer invention of the man's own brain.\" Spottiswoode did not think it likely that Gowrie would have plotted with Logan.<ref>''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1887), pp. 150-152 footnote.</ref> George Sprot had been connected with Logan, if only because the lawyer had signed as a witness to some of Logan's property transactions.<ref>''HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling'' (London, 1878), p. 648 no. 25.</ref>

In 1609 the Logan family had their lands and properties forfeited by the [[Parliament of Scotland]]<ref>https://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?action=print&id=12335&filename=jamesvi_trans&type=trans</ref>, including Logan of Restalrig's eldest son, also called Robert. The records of Parliament include the text of five alleged letters from Robert to Gowrie. The Kirk Minister of Coldingham, Alexander Watson, testified that the spelling and hand of the letters was that of Logan. Watson made detailed comment on the habits of Logan's [[orthography]].<ref>''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1816), pp. 419-428.</ref>

== Name ==

His appellation is correctly translated as \"Hrabar, the Black Robe Wearer\" (i.e., Hrabar The Monk),  ''chernorizets'' being the lowest rank in the monastic hierarchy (translatable as black robe wearer, see [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/čьrnъ]] and [[wikt:riza]]), \"Hrabar\" (\"Hrabr\") supposed to be his [[given name]]. However, sometimes he is referred to as \"Chernorizets the Brave\", \"Brave\" being the translation of \"Hrabar\" assumed to be a nickname.

No biographical information is available about him, but his name is usually considered to be a pseudonym used by one of the other famous men of letters at the Preslav Literary School or may be even by [[Tsar]] [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] (893-927), since normally monks assume Christian names of biblical or early Christian [[onomastics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== ''On the Letters'' {{Anchor|O pismenech}} ==

[[File:Xrabr1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A page from the oldest (1348) copy]]
Chernorizets Hrabar is (as far as is known) the author of only one literary work, \"On the Letters\" ({{lang-cu|О писмєньхъ}}, '''''O pismenĭhŭ''''', {{lang-bg|За буквите}}), one of the most admired and popular works of literature written in [[Old Church Slavonic]]. The work was supposedly written some time after the Preslav Ecclesiastical People's Council in 893,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} but before 921,<ref name=Veder>William Veder (1996), ''Textual Incompatibility and Many-Pronged Stemmata''.</ref> and is the only known medieval literary work to quote the exact year of the invention of the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] (855).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The work was partly based on Greek scholia and grammar treatises and expounded on the origin of the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] and Slavic Bible translation.<ref name=Veder />

In ''On the Letters'', Chernorizets Hrabar defends the alphabet against its Greek critics and proves not only its right to existence but also its superiority to the [[Greek alphabet]] arguing that the Greek letters are neither the oldest known to man, nor divine. At the same time Chernorizets Hrabar opposes Glagolitic dogmatists{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and makes several suggestions as to how the alphabet can be further improved.

He also provided information critical to Slavonic [[palaeography]] with his mention that the pre-Christian Slavs employed \"strokes and incisions\" ({{lang-cu|чръты и рѣзы}}, ''črŭty i rězy''), translated as \"tallies and sketches\" below) writing that was, apparently, insufficient properly to reflect the spoken language.

The oldest surviving manuscript copy dates back to 1348 and was made by the monk Laurentius for Tsar [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]]. The work has also been printed in [[Vilnius]] (1575–1580), [[Moscow]] (1637), [[Saint Petersburg]] (1776), [[Supraśl]] (1781).

== Name ==

His appellation is correctly translated as \"Hrabar, the Black Robe Wearer\" (i.e., Hrabar The Monk),  ''chernorizets'' being the lowest rank in the monastic hierarchy (translatable as black robe wearer, see [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/čьrnъ]] and [[wikt:riza]]), \"Hrabar\" (\"Hrabr\") supposed to be his [[given name]]. However, sometimes he is referred to as \"Chernorizets the Brave\", \"Brave\" being the translation of \"Hrabar\" assumed to be a nickname.

No biographical information is available about him, but his name is usually considered to be a pseudonym used by one of the other famous men of letters at the Preslav Literary School or may be even by [[Tsar]] [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] (893-927), since normally monks assume Christian names of biblical or early Christian [[onomastics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== ''On the Letters'' {{Anchor|O pismenech}} ==

[[File:Xrabr1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A page from the oldest (1348) copy]]
Chernorizets Hrabar is (as far as is known) the author of only one literary work, \"On the Letters\" ({{lang-cu|О писмєньхъ}}, '''''O pismenĭhŭ''''', {{lang-bg|За буквите}}), one of the most admired and popular works of literature written in [[Old Church Slavonic]]. The work was supposedly written some time after the Preslav Ecclesiastical People's Council in 893,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} but before 921,<ref name=Veder>William Veder (1996), ''Textual Incompatibility and Many-Pronged Stemmata''.</ref> and is the only known medieval literary work to quote the exact year of the invention of the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] (855).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The work was partly based on Greek scholia and grammar treatises and expounded on the origin of the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] and Slavic Bible translation.<ref name=Veder />

In ''On the Letters'', Chernorizets Hrabar defends the alphabet against its Greek critics and proves not only its right to existence but also its superiority to the [[Greek alphabet]] arguing that the Greek letters are neither the oldest known to man, nor divine. At the same time Chernorizets Hrabar opposes Glagolitic dogmatists{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and makes several suggestions as to how the alphabet can be further improved.

He also provided information critical to Slavonic [[palaeography]] with his mention that the pre-Christian Slavs employed \"strokes and incisions\" ({{lang-cu|чръты и рѣзы}}, ''črŭty i rězy''), translated as \"tallies and sketches\" below) writing that was, apparently, insufficient properly to reflect the spoken language. It is thought that this may have been a form of [[runic script]] but no authentic examples are known to have survived.

==History==
Frank and Albert Michaud, two local prospectors, discovered the cave in 1900, when they felt cold air blowing out of a small hole in a canyon. It is unknown whether any previous inhabitants of the area were aware of the natural cave opening, which was not large enough for a person to enter.<ref name=\"brochure\">Jewel Cave brochure; National Park Service; GPO, WDC</ref>

After enlarging the cave entrance with dynamite, the Michaud brothers found a cavern lined with [[calcite]] crystals, which led them to name it \"Jewel Cave\".  The brothers tried to capitalize on the discovery, widening the opening, building walkways inside, and opening it to tourists. Although their venture was unsuccessful, news of the discovery eventually reached Washington. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] proclaimed Jewel Cave a National Monument on February&nbsp;7, 1908. The area around the natural entrance to the cave was further developed by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] in the 1930s. The [[National Park Service]] assumed management of the monument in 1933 and began offering tours in 1939.<ref name=\"brochure\" />

[[File:Herb and Jan Conn.jpg|thumb|right|Jan and Herb Conn]]
As recently as 1959, less than {{convert|2|mi|km|sp=us}} of passageway had been discovered. That year, however, [[Herb and Jan Conn]], local rock climbers, began exploring, and within two years had mapped {{convert|15|mi|km|sp=us}}. Much of the new discoveries lay outside the boundaries of the monument, under land managed by the [[United States Forest Service]]. The two agencies performed a land swap in 1965, establishing the present boundaries of the park, and enabling the development of a new part of the cave. The Park Service sunk a {{convert|300|ft|m|sp=us}} elevator shaft to a previously remote cave area, and built concrete walks and metal stairs and platforms along a one-half-mile loop. The \"Scenic Tour\" was opened in 1972. Most modern-day visitors tour that part of the cave.  
In August 2000, an {{convert|83000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} [[forest fire]] burned 90% of the monument and the surrounding area. The [[visitor center]] and historic buildings were spared.

==Exploration==
[[File:US National Park marker for the Black Hills geology.jpg|thumb|Location of the cave with respect to regional Black Hills geology]]
By 1979, [[Herb and Jan Conn]] had discovered, named, and mapped more than  {{convert|64|mi|km|sp=us}} of passages. Although they largely retired from caving by the early 1980s, exploration has continued unabated. Because the areas being explored take many hours to reach, explorers now sometimes camp in the cave during expeditions of as long as four days. The cave is mapped by traditional survey techniques, using [[compass]], [[clinometer]] and today with lasers instead of tape measures.<ref name=\"brochure\" />

Its {{convert|198.00|mi|km|abbr=on}} of mapped passageway make Jewel Cave the third longest cave in the world, after [[Mammoth Cave]] System in Kentucky and [[Sistema Sac Actun]] at the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] ([[Mexico]]), at {{convert|198|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"JECA\" />

The discovered areas in the cave account for only about 3 to 5% of the estimated total air volume of the cave. The cave volume is estimated by measuring the amount of air that the cave \"exhales\" when the outside air pressure drops and \"inhales\" when the outside air pressure rises.<ref name=\"brochure\" />

==Geology==
[[File:Hydromagnesite balloon.jpg|frame|left|Hydromagnesite balloon]]
Jewel Cave is a \"breathing cave,\" which means air enters or exits the cave with changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] from day to night or due to changes in the weather.  This was first explained by Herb Conn in 1966.<ref name=Keller>{{cite book|last1=KellerLynn|first1=K.|title=Jewel Cave National Monument Geologic Resources Inventory Report, National Resource Report NPS/NRPC/GRD/NRR 2009/084|date=2009|publisher=US National Park.}}</ref>

Most of the cave formed within the [[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian]] Pahasapa [[Limestone]] deposited 350 million years ago.  The later limestones, [[sandstone]]s, and [[shale]]s deposited in these [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] seas were eroded with the [[geologic uplift]] associated with [[Laramide Orogeny]] and the formation of the [[Black Hills]].  The main passages of the cave then formed in the early [[Cenozoic]].  Uplift continued in the [[Late Pliocene]] or [[Early Pleistocene]] lowering the [[water table]] and draining the cave.<ref name=Keller/>{{rp|29–30}}

Jewel Cave passages follow a pattern of [[joint (geology)|joint]] development. The faults and joints are associated with the uplift of the Black Hills approximately 58 to 54 million years ago.  After main cave [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], a thick layer of [[calcite]] lined the walls about 2.5 million years ago.<ref name=Keller/>{{rp|12}}

During cave development and afterwards, [[speleothems]] and [[speleogen]]s formed, including the \"jewels\" or [[spar (mineralogy)|spar]]. Other examples include [[stalactites]], [[stalagmite]]s, [[flowstone]], [[cave popcorn]], [[boxwork]]s, [[helictite]]s, scintillites, conulites, coralloids, [[cave pearl]]s, [[rimstone]], rafts, rims, vents, and [[frostwork]].  The [[gypsum]] formations include needles, beards, cotton, hair, flowers, and spiders. Finally, Jewel Cave contains a very rare formation called a [[hydromagnesite]] balloon. Those are created when gas of an unknown source inflates a pasty substance formed by the precipitation of the magnesium carbonate hydroxide mineral.<ref name=Keller/>{{rp|14–18}}

==Access==
Jewel Cave is open year round. The Park Service offers three tours: the scenic tour, a half-mile loop through a paved and lighted central portion of the cave accessible by elevator; the historic tour, a candlelight tour through the earliest-discovered part of the cave; and a wild caving tour, through an undeveloped part of the cave near the scenic loop. There are 3 surface trails varying in length and difficulty.<ref name=\"brochure\" />

The later limestones, [[sandstone]]s, and [[shale]]s deposited in these [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] seas were eroded with the [[geologic uplift]] associated with [[Laramide Orogeny]] and the formation of the [[Black Hills]].  The main passages of the cave then formed in the early [[Cenozoic]].  Uplift continued in the [[Late Pliocene]] or [[Early Pleistocene]] lowering the [[water table]] and draining the cave.<ref name=Keller/>{{rp|29–30}}

Jewel Cave passages follow a pattern of [[joint (geology)|joint]] development. The faults and joints are associated with the uplift of the Black Hills approximately 58 to 54 million years ago.  After main cave [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], a thick layer of [[calcite]] lined the walls about 2.5 million years ago.<ref name=Keller/>{{rp|12}}

During cave development and afterwards, [[speleothems]] and [[speleogen]]s formed, including the \"jewels\" or [[spar (mineralogy)|spar]]. Other examples include [[stalactites]], [[stalagmite]]s, [[flowstone]], [[cave popcorn]], [[boxwork]]s, [[helictite]]s, scintillites, conulites, coralloids, [[cave pearl]]s, [[rimstone]], rafts, rims, vents, and [[frostwork]].  The [[gypsum]] formations include needles, beards, cotton, hair, flowers, and spiders. Finally, Jewel Cave contains a very rare formation called a [[hydromagnesite]] balloon. Those are created when gas of an unknown source inflates a pasty substance formed by the precipitation of the magnesium carbonate hydroxide mineral.<ref name=Keller/>{{rp|14–18}}

==Access==
Jewel Cave is open year round. The Park Service offers three tours: the scenic tour, a half-mile loop through a paved and lighted central portion of the cave accessible by elevator; the historic tour, a candlelight tour through the earliest-discovered part of the cave; and a wild caving tour, through an undeveloped part of the cave near the scenic loop. There are 3 surface trails varying in length and difficulty.<ref name=\"brochure\" />

'''Fort Valley''' is a [[mountain]] [[valley]] in [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah County]], [[Virginia]].<ref name=GNIS>{{cite GNIS|1483500|Fort Valley|December 12, 2016}}</ref>  It is often called \"valley within a valley\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern [[Massanutten Mountain]] range in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], which are part of the  in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]].  The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the Massanutten range, is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller highland valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Fort Valley.

Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain ridgeline in the southernmost end of the vallet and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. 

Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. 

==Roads and Gaps==

Between Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. 

Between Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.

Roads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.

==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==

The [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. 

The [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.

Fort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)

==History==
According to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap on a rough road constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] would have made Washington's plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked an army road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed the easier entry along Passage Creek is unclear, leading to some belief the story is apocryphal. However the story is likely tied to the name given to Fort Valley.

[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 – 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.

Signal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping, unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The site can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.

The [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

'''''Stegomastodon''''' ('roof breast tooth') is an extinct [[genus]] of [[gomphothere]]s, a family of [[proboscidea]]ns. Its range spread through [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] species were synonymized with ''Notiomastodon''.

'''Marcus Loew''' (May 7, 1870 &ndash; September 5, 1927) was an American [[business magnate]] and a pioneer of the [[motion picture]] industry who formed [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew's Theatres]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film studio (MGM).

==Life and career==
Loew was born in New York City, into a poor [[Jew]]ish family, who had emigrated to [[New York City]] a few years previously from Austria and Germany.<ref>Caso, Frank. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=88 \"Marcus Loew.\"] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified January 28, 2014.</ref> He was forced by circumstances to work at a very young age and had little formal education. Nevertheless, beginning with a small investment from money saved from menial jobs, he bought into the [[penny arcade]] business. Shortly after, in partnership with [[Adolph Zukor]] and others, he founded the successful but short-lived [[Automatic Vaudeville Company]] which established a chain of arcades across several cities. After the company dissolved in 1904 Loew converted his share of the business into [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]s and over time he turned Loew's Theatres into a leading chain of vaudeville and [[movie theater]]s in the United States.

By 1905, Marcus Loew was on his own and his success eventually necessitated that he secure a steady flow of product for his theaters. In 1904, he founded the People's Vaudeville Company, a theater chain which showcased one-reel films as well as live variety shows. In 1910, the company had considerably expanded and was renamed Loew's Consolidated Enterprises. His associates included [[Adolph Zukor]], [[Joseph Schenck]], and [[Nicholas Schenck]]. In addition to theaters, Loew and the Schencks expanded the [[Fort George Amusement Park]] in upper Manhattan.

[[Image:1914 MarcusLoew his 42ndSt office NYC.png|thumb|left|Marcus Loew in his office, ca.1914]]
By 1913, Loew operated a large number of theaters in New York City including the [[American Music Hall]], Avenue A Theatre, Avenue B Theatre, [[Broadway Theatre (41st Street)|Broadway Theatre]] (41st St.), Circle Theatre, and the Columbia Theatre in Brooklyn. Other Loew-operated theaters were the Delancey St. Theatre, Greeley Sq. Theatre, [[Herald Square Theatre]], Liberty Theatre, Brooklyn, Lincoln Sq. Theatre, National Theatre (149th St.), Plaza Theatre, 7th Ave. Theatre (124th St.), Shubert Theatre, Brooklyn, and the Yorkville Theatre.<ref name=\"TheatricalGuide\">Cahn-Leighton Theatrical Guide, 1913-1914</ref> Outside of New York, he managed the [[Columbia Theatre (Washington, D.C.)]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert K. |last=Headley |title=Motion Picture Exhibition in Washington, D.C. |location=Jefferson |publisher=McFarland & Co. |year=1999 |isbn=1-4766-0851-2 |page=250 |quote=... as he began to expand his movie empire. In October 1919, Loew and Walter Brownley of Washington purchased the Columbia and two buildings on 12th Street for half a million dollars. The Columbia was one of the big moneymakers among ... }}</ref><ref>http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/7369</ref> [[Columbia Theatre (Boston)]] and the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Philadelphia)]].<ref name=\"TheatricalGuide\"/>

Loew found himself faced with a serious dilemma: his merged companies lacked a central managerial command structure. Loew preferred to remain in New York overseeing the growing chain of Loew's Theatres. Film production had been gravitating toward southern California since 1913. By 1917 he oversaw a number of enterprises: Borough Theatre Co., Empress Amusement Corp., Fort George Amusement Co., Glendive Amusement Corp., Greeley Square Amusement Co., Loew's Consolidated Enterprise, Loew's Theatrical Enterprises, Mascot Amusement Co., Natonia Amusement Co., People's Vaudeville Co.<ref>Directory of directors in the city of New York, 1917-1918</ref> In 1919, Loew reorganized the company under the name Loew's, Inc.<ref>Poor's and Moody's manual, 1921</ref>

In 1920, Loew purchased [[Metro Pictures|Metro Pictures Corporation]]. A few years later, he acquired a controlling interest in the financially troubled [[Goldwyn Picture Corporation]] which at that point was controlled by theater impresario [[Lee Shubert]]. Goldwyn Pictures owned the \"[[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]]\" trademark and studio property in [[Culver City, California]]. But without its founder [[Samuel Goldwyn]], the Goldwyn studio lacked strong management. With Loew's vice president [[Nicholas Schenck]] needed in New York City to help manage the large [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie theater operations, Loew had to find a qualified executive to take charge of this new [[Los Angeles]] entity.

Loew recalled meeting a film producer named [[Louis B. Mayer]] who had been operating a successful, if modest, studio in east Los Angeles. Mayer had been making low budget melodramas for a number of years, marketing them primarily to women. Since he rented most of his equipment and hired most of his stars on a per-picture basis, Loew wasn't after Mayer's brick and mortar business; he wanted Mayer and his Chief of Production, the former [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] executive, [[Irving Thalberg]]. Nicholas Schenck was dispatched to finalize the deal that ultimately resulted in the formation of Metro-Goldwyn Pictures in April 1924 with Mayer as the studio head and Thalberg chief of production.

Mayer's company folded into Metro Goldwyn with two notable additions: Mayer Pictures' contracts with key [[director (film)|director]]s such as [[Fred Niblo]] and [[John M. Stahl]], and up-and-coming actress [[Norma Shearer]], later married to Thalberg. Mayer would eventually be rewarded by having his name added to the company. Loews Inc. would act as MGM's financier and retain controlling interest for decades.

While immediately successful, Loew didn't live  to see the powerhouse that MGM was to become. He died three years later in 1927 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 57 at his country home in [[Glen Cove, New York]]. Reporting his death, [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] called him \"the most beloved man of all show business of all time\".<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Marcus Loew Wept For|date=September 7, 1927|page=1|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety87-1927-09/Variety87-1927-09#page/n0/mode/1up|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref> He was interred in the Maimonides Cemetery in [[Brooklyn]].<ref>[https://www.jta.org/1927/09/11/archive/simple-rites-mark-late-marcus-loews-funeral Jewish Telegraphic Agency]</ref>

For his very significant contribution to the development of the motion picture industry, Marcus Loew has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1617 Vine Street. To this day, the Loew name is synonymous with movie theaters.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Sobel |authorlink=Robert Sobel |title=The Entrepreneurs: Explorations Within the American Business Tradition |location=New York |publisher=Weybright & Talley |year=1974 |chapter=Marcus Loew: An Artist in Spite of Himself |pages=[https://archive.org/details/entrepreneursexp00sobe/page/247 247–288] |isbn=0-679-40064-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/entrepreneursexp00sobe/page/247 }}</ref>

'''Marcus Loew''' (May 7, 1870 &ndash; September 5, 1927) was an American [[business magnate]] and a pioneer of the [[motion picture]] industry who formed [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew's Theatres]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film studio (MGM).

==Life and career==
Loew was born in New York City, into a poor [[Jew]]ish family, who had emigrated to [[New York City]] a few years previously from Austria and Germany.<ref>Caso, Frank. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=88 \"Marcus Loew.\"] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified January 28, 2014.</ref> He was forced by circumstances to work at a very young age and had little formal education. Nevertheless, beginning with a small investment from money saved from menial jobs, he bought into the [[penny arcade]] business. Shortly after, in partnership with [[Adolph Zukor]] and others, he founded the successful but short-lived [[Automatic Vaudeville Company]] which established a chain of arcades across several cities. After the compani dissolved in 1904 Loew converted his share of the business into [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]s and over time he turned Loew's Theatres into a leading chain of vaudeville and [[movie theater]]s in the United States.

By 1905, Marcus Loew was on his own and his success eventually necessitated that he secure a steady flow of product for his theaters. In 1904, he founded the People's Vaudeville Company, a theater chain which showcased one-reel films as well as live variety shows. In 1910, the company had considerably expanded and was renamed Loew's Consolidated Enterprises. His associates included [[Adolph Zukor]], [[Joseph Schenck]], and [[Nicholas Schenck]]. In addition to theaters, Loew and the Schencks expanded the [[Fort George Amusement Park]] in upper Manhattan.

By 1913, Loew operated a large number of theaters in New York City including the [[American Music Hall]], Avenue A Theatre, Avenue B Theatre, [[Broadway Theatre (41st Street)|Broadway Theatre]] (41st St.), Circle Theatre, and the Columbia Theatre in Brooklyn. Other Loew-operated theaters were the Delancey St. Theatre, Greeley Sq. Theatre, [[Herald Square Theatre]], Liberty Theatre, Brooklyn, Lincoln Sq. Theatre, National Theatre (149th St.), Plaza Theatre, 7th Ave. Theatre (124th St.), Shubert Theatre, Brooklyn, and the Yorkville Theatre.<ref name=\"TheatricalGuide\">Cahn-Leighton Theatrical Guide, 1913-1914</ref> Outside of New York, he managed the [[Columbia Theatre (Washington, D.C.)]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert K. |last=Headley |title=Motion Picture Exhibition in Washington, D.C. |location=Jefferson |publisher=McFarland & Co. |year=1999 |isbn=1-4766-0851-2 |page=250 |quote=... as he began to expand his movie empire. In October 1919, Loew and Walter Brownley of Washington purchased the Columbia and two buildings on 12th Street for half a million dollars. The Columbia was one of the big moneymakers among ... }}</ref><ref>http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/7369</ref> [[Columbia Theatre (Boston)]] and the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Philadelphia)]].<ref name=\"TheatricalGuide\"/>

Loew found himself faced with a serious dilemma: his merged companies lacked a central managerial command structure. Loew preferred to remain in New York overseeing the growing chain of Loew's Theatres. Film production had been gravitating toward southern California since 1913. By 1917 he oversaw a number of enterprises: Borough Theatre Co., Empress Amusement Corp., Fort George Amusement Co., Glendive Amusement Corp., Greeley Square Amusement Co., Loew's Consolidated Enterprise, Loew's Theatrical Enterprises, Mascot Amusement Co., Natonia Amusement Co., People's Vaudeville Co.<ref>Directory of directors in the city of New York, 1917-1918</ref> In 1919, Loew reorganized the company under the name Loew's, Inc.<ref>Poor's and Moody's manual, 1921</ref>

In 1920, Loew purchased [[Metro Pictures|Metro Pictures Corporation]]. A few years later, he acquired a controlling interest in the financially troubled [[Goldwyn Picture Corporation]] which at that point was controlled by theater impresario [[Lee Shubert]]. Goldwyn Pictures owned the \"[[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]]\" trademark and studio property in [[Culver City, California]]. But without its founder [[Samuel Goldwyn]], the Goldwyn studio lacked strong management. With Loew's vice president [[Nicholas Schenck]] needed in New York City to help manage the large [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie theater operations, Loew had to find a qualified executive to take charge of this new [[Los Angeles]] entity.

Loew recalled meeting a film producer named [[Louis B. Mayer]] who had been operating a successful, if modest, studio in east Los Angeles. Mayer had been making low budget melodramas for a number of years, marketing them primarily to women. Since he rented most of his equipment and hired most of his stars on a per-picture basis, Loew wasn't after Mayer's brick and mortar business; he wanted Mayer and his Chief of Production, the former [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] executive, [[Irving Thalberg]]. Nicholas Schenck was dispatched to finalize the deal that ultimately resulted in the formation of Metro-Goldwyn Pictures in April 1924 with Mayer as the studio head and Thalberg chief of production.

Mayer's company folded into Metro Goldwyn with two notable additions: Mayer Pictures' contracts with key [[director (film)|director]]s such as [[Fred Niblo]] and [[John M. Stahl]], and up-and-coming actress [[Norma Shearer]], later married to Thalberg. Mayer would eventually be rewarded by having his name added to the company. Loews Inc. would act as MGM's financier and retain controlling interest for decades.

While immediately successful, Loew didn't live  to see the powerhouse that MGM was to become. He died three years later in 1927 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 57 at his country home in [[Glen Cove, New York]]. Reporting his death, [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] called him \"the most beloved man of all show business of all time\".<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Marcus Loew Wept For|date=September 7, 1927|page=1|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety87-1927-09/Variety87-1927-09#page/n0/mode/1up|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref> He was interred in the Maimonides Cemetery in [[Brooklyn]].<ref>[https://www.jta.org/1927/09/11/archive/simple-rites-mark-late-marcus-loews-funeral Jewish Telegraphic Agency]</ref>

For his very significant contribution to the development of the motion picture industry, Marcus Loew has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1617 Vine Street. To this day, the Loew name is synonymous with movie theaters.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Sobel |authorlink=Robert Sobel |title=The Entrepreneurs: Explorations Within the American Business Tradition |location=New York |publisher=Weybright & Talley |year=1974 |chapter=Marcus Loew: An Artist in Spite of Himself |pages=[https://archive.org/details/entrepreneursexp00sobe/page/247 247–288] |isbn=0-679-40064-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/entrepreneursexp00sobe/page/247 }}</ref>
