Retrieved 31 August 2018</ref>\n\n=== The First World War ===\n\n[[World War I|The Great War]] meant fewer people were signing up to be residents of St. Margaret's House, and membership of the clubs dropped off because the blackout stopped girls from being able to attend.\n \nThe Hon. Mrs Whittuck, a committee member of the  House, had died before the war in 1915;, two years later, her executors called in the balance of her debt, which included the loan she had taken out to buy St. Margaret's House. With funds limited in an already difficult time, it looked like St. Margaret's House would have to close. But an anonymous benefactor cleared off most of St. Margaret's House's debt, allowing it to remain open.<ref>Beauman, Katherine Bentley [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iMrJN5xz8SAC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=Hon.+Mrs+Whittuck+st+margaret%27s+house&source=bl&ots=gik4jKgz_X&sig=FWtzQgTuIpd6KdRbnbUiheHCTA4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIuvvH9pvcAhWMX8AKHXNJDL4Q6AEISTAD#v=onepage&q=Hon.%20Mrs%20Whittuck%20st%20margaret's%20house&f=false \"Women and the Settlement Movement\"] pp. 97, Radcliffe Press, 1993. Retrieved 31 August 2018</ref>\n\n=== In between wars ===\n\nThe social upheavals following the War meant residents were no longer ladies of independent means, but working people, including teachers and librarians, helping with House activities as part of their rent.<ref>St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 2</ref>\n \nAnd by the early 1920s, St. Margaret's House had fourteen residents, including the Head and the Bursar, six lodgers engaged in teaching or social work, two medical students and one Charity Organisation Society worker. At this point, the settlement still only housed women.\n \nIn 1924, St. Margaret's House started a children's play hours\u2019 scheme twice a week for over 50 children in Bethnal Green. This same year, the house also helped launch the local branch of the Industrial Christian Fellowship. \n \nThe house secured the services of Eleanor Kelly in 1929, who was a founding member of the Association of Welfare Workers. She said of her work, \"All firms who had been doing welfare work before the outbreak of war were asked to take relays of people (mostly women) to train.\"<ref>Woollacott, Angela [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09612029400200043 \"Maternalism, professionalism and industrial welfare supervisors in World War I Britain\"]\t, Women's History Review, 3:1, 29-56.

This meant that from 1933, St. Margaret's House assisted in the running of both the Peel Grove Hobbies Centre for the unemployed and the Unemployed Men's Centre.<ref>St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 3\n</ref> They also started to send out food parcels to old-aged pensioners and the very poor.\n\n=== The Second World War and post-war ===\n\nWith the outbreak of war, the Bethnal Green branch of the Citizens Advice Bureaux was organised in the House, and the House became an evacuation sub-office during [[the Blitz]].<ref>St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 3</ref>\n \nHalf of the houses in Bethnal Green were destroyed by bombing during the [[World War II|Second World War]], but St. Margaret's House escaped serious damage. Though there were  several near misses, including an incendiary bomb which fell on the chapel roof and failed to ignite.<ref>St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 5\n</ref> Post-war, the main house had to undergo extensive repair, including a new roof and rewiring. \n \nIn 1953, the council decided that men could live at St. Margaret's House as well as women, as the number of female students wishing to take up residence at the house had declined.<ref>St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 5</ref>\n \nThroughout the 1960s and 70s, St. Margaret's House continued to face financial ups and downs, but a visit by the poet laureate, Sir [[John Betjeman]], in 1975, helped to raise enough money to get the house through this financial crisis. \n \nAnd throughout the 1980s, St. Margaret's House began new, community-centred initiatives with organisations including Bethnal Green Citizens Advice Bureau, the Tower Hamlets Vietnamese Families Association, and the Activity in Retirement Workcentre.<ref>St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 11</ref>\n\n=== Expansion of St. Margaret\u2019s House ===\n\nIn June 1993, the settlement became the leaseholder of two adjoining buildings, number 15 and 17 Old Ford Road. With more space, the House expanded its work and, from the extra revenue generated, the House established its Community Arts Project.<ref>St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 10</ref>\n \nAnd by 2001, with funding from both public and private sources, St. Margaret's House was able to buy both of these houses.\n \nIn 2006, the House opened the Gallery Caf\u00e9 and they now manage four separate community projects out of their buildings,which are the Gallery Caf\u00e9, Ayoka Charity Shop, Yoganest and The Create Place.\n\nSt. Margaret's House now includes the buildings at 15, 17, 21, 23, 27, and 29 Old Ford Road.\nAnd, as of March 2017, the charity has 14 trustees. 28 employees and 18 volunteers<ref>BETA Charity Commission, [http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details%20st%20margaret's%20house \"St. Margaret's House\"], March 2017.
