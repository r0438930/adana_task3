The city is located in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]] the city's population is 57,713.\n\n==History==\nWhat is now San Rafael was once the site of several [[Coast Miwok]] villages: '''Awani-wi''', near downtown San Rafael, '''Ewu''', near [[Terra Linda, San Rafael, California|Terra Linda]] and '''Shotomko-cha''', in [[Marinwood]].<ref>Peterson, Bonnie J. (1976). ''Dawn of the World: Coast Miwok Myths''. {{ISBN|0-912908-04-1}}</ref>\n[[Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel]] was founded in what is now downtown San Rafael as the 20th [[Spain|Spanish]] mission in the colonial [[Mexico|Mexican]] province of ''[[Alta California]]'' by three priests\u2014Father [[Narciso Dur\u00e1n]] from [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]], Father Abella from [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]], Father [[Luis G\u00edl y Taboada]] from [[La Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de los Angeles]]\u2014on Dec. 14, 1817, four years before [[Mexico]] gained independence from [[Spain]]. Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel was located a donkey's day walk to the mission below it. The mission and the city are named after the [[Archangel]] [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], the Angel of Healing.\n\nThe mission was originally planned as a hospital site for [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] who had become ill at the cold [[San Francisco]] [[Mission Dolores]]. Father Luis Gil, who spoke several Native American languages, was put in charge of the facility. In part because of its ideal weather, San Rafael was later upgraded to full mission status in 1822.  The mission had 300 converts within its first year, and 1,140 converts by 1828. The Mexican government took over the California missions in 1834, and [[Mission San Rafael]] was abandoned in 1844, eventually falling into ruin. The current mission was built in 1949 in the style of the original, but faces at right angles to the alignment of the original.\n\nThe [[San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad]] reached San Rafael in 1879 and was linked to the national rail network in 1888.  The [[United States Navy]] operated a San Pablo Bay [[degaussing]] range from San Rafael through [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/USN-Act/CA.html|title=U.S. Naval Activities World War II by State|publisher=Patrick Clancey|accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.4|sqmi|km2}}.  {{convert|16.5|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|6.0|sqmi|km2}} of it (26.55%) is water. South of the county is [[San Francisco]].\n\nNotable landmarks include:\n* [[Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel]], around which the city developed\n* the [[Marin County Civic Center]] building, designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\n* the [[Rafael Film Center]]\n* [[China Camp State Park]], and\n* [[KernerFX|Kerner Studios]].\n* [[Peacock Gap Golf Course]] which is open to the public.\n\nThere are several public parks in the city.\n\n==Environmental features==\nThe San Rafael shoreline has been historically filled to a considerable extent to accommodate land development, with underlying bay mud (saturated clayed silt) of up to {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} in thickness.  At certain locations such as Murphys Point, the sandstone or shale rock outcrops through the mud.\n\nSan Rafael has a wide diversity of natural habitats from forests at the higher elevations to marshland and estuarine settings.  Its marshes are home to the [[endangered species]] [[Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse]].  There are also [[riparian]] areas including the [[San Rafael Creek]] and [[Miller Creek (Marin County, California)|Miller Creek]] corridors.\n\n===Climate===\nSan Rafael has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csb''), with mild winter lows seldom reaching the freezing mark.

The city is located in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]] the city's population is 57,713.\n\n==History==\nWhat is now San Rafael was once the site of several [[Coast Miwok]] villages: '''Awani-wi''', near downtown San Rafael, '''Ewu''', near [[Terra Linda, San Rafael, California|Terra Linda]] and '''Shotomko-cha''', in [[Marinwood]].<ref>Peterson, Bonnie J. (1976). ''Dawn of the World: Coast Miwok Myths''. {{ISBN|0-912908-04-1}}</ref>\n[[Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel]] was founded in what is now downtown San Rafael as the 20th [[Spain|Spanish]] mission in the colonial [[Mexico|Mexican]] province of ''[[Alta California]]'' by three priests\u2014Father [[Narciso Dur\u00e1n]] from [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]], Father Abella from [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]], Father [[Luis G\u00edl y Taboada]] from [[La Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de los Angeles]]\u2014on Dec. 14, 1817, four years before [[Mexico]] gained independence from [[Spain]]. Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel was located a donkey's day walk to the mission below it. The mission and the city are named after the [[Archangel]] [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], the Angel of Healing. \n\nThe mission was originally planned as a hospital site for [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] who had become ill at the cold [[San Francisco]] [[Mission Dolores]]. Father Luis Gil, who spoke several Native American languages, was put in charge of the facility. In part because of its ideal weather, San Rafael was later upgraded to full mission status in 1822.  The mission had 300 converts within its first year, and 1,140 converts by 1828. The Mexican government took over the California missions in 1834, and [[Mission San Rafael]] was abandoned in 1844, eventually falling into ruin. The current mission was built in 1949 in the style of the original, but faces at right angles to the alignment of the original.\n\nThe [[San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad]] reached San Rafael in 1879 and was linked to the national rail network in 1888.  The [[United States Navy]] operated a San Pablo Bay [[degaussing]] range from San Rafael through [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/USN-Act/CA.html|title=U.S. Naval Activities World War II by State|publisher=Patrick Clancey|accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.4|sqmi|km2}}.  {{convert|16.5|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|6.0|sqmi|km2}} of it (26.55%) is water. South of the county is [[San Francisco]].\n\nNotable landmarks include:\n* [[Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel]], around which the city developed\n* the [[Marin County Civic Center]] building, designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\n* the [[Rafael Film Center]]\n* [[China Camp State Park]], and\n* [[KernerFX|Kerner Studios]].\n* [[Peacock Gap Golf Course]] which is open to the public.\n\nThere are several public parks in the city.\n\n==Environmental features==\nThe San Rafael shoreline has been historically filled to a considerable extent to accommodate land development, with underlying bay mud (saturated clayed silt) of up to {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} in thickness.  At certain locations such as Murphys Point, the sandstone or shale rock outcrops through the mud.\n\nSan Rafael has a wide diversity of natural habitats from forests at the higher elevations to marshland and estuarine settings.  Its marshes are home to the [[endangered species]] [[Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse]].  There are also [[riparian]] areas including the [[San Rafael Creek]] and [[Miller Creek (Marin County, California)|Miller Creek]] corridors.\n\n===Climate===\nSan Rafael has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csb''), with mild winter lows seldom reaching the freezing mark.
