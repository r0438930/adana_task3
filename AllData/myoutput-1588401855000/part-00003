The European funded research project STILLING<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/201175_en.html |title=STILLING: Towards improved understanding of the worldwide decline of wind speed in a climate change scenario |website=CORDIS}}</ref> is a current (2016\u20132018) initiative that aims to reduce this constraint by rescuing, homogenizing and recovering the longest and highest-quality wind speed series across the globe. The project is currently compiling wind speed records starting in the 1880s providing scientists with approximately 130-year records, roughly 80 years more than previous studies available in the scientific literature. The better knowledge of the past wind speed climate is crucial for understanding the present \"global terrestrial stilling\" phenomenon, detecting if [[climate change]] is behind this slowdown of wind or similar trends-cycles occurred in the past and could be expected for the future. That is with longer records decadal cycles may be detected.\n\n==Implications of wind speed changes==\n\nThe \"global terrestrial stilling\" phenomenon is of great scientific, socioeconomic, and environmental interest because of the key impact of even small wind speed changes on atmospheric and ocean dynamics and related fields such as: (i) renewable wind energy;<ref>Otero C, Manchado C, Arias R, Bruschi VM, G\u00f3mez-J\u00e1uregui V, Cendrero A (2012), Wind energy development in Cantabria, Spain.

However, for wind energy near-surface wind speeds are mainly observed within 10m of the land surface, and with turbines being located some 60-80m above the land surface more studies are needed here.  More studies are also needed at higher elevation sites, which are often areas that yield much of our freshwater supplies, called water-towers,<ref>Viviroli D, Archer DR, Buytaert W, Fowler HJ, Greenwood GB, Hamlet AF, Huang Y, Koboltschnig G, Litaor MI, Lopez-Moreno JI, Lorentz S, Schadler B, Schreier H, Schwaiger K, Vuille M, Woods R. 2011.
