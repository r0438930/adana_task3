She came to prominence as a child star in the 1970s, including a notable role in the TV series ''[[Just William (1977 TV series)|Just William]]''. In the 1980s, she played companion [[Mel Bush]] in ''[[Doctor Who]]''. She has also been known for appearing in various musicals in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], including shows such as ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. From 2015 to 2018, she portrayed the role of [[Carmel Kazemi]] on the [[BBC One|BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', for which she received the [[The British Soap Awards|2016 British Soap Award]] for Best Newcomer.\n\n== Early career ==\nBonnie Langford attended [[the Arts Educational School]], [[St Catherine's School, Twickenham]] and the [[Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts|Italia Conti Academy stage school]]. She first came to public attention when, aged six years old, she won the talent show ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]''. This led to early fame in the television series ''[[Just William (1970s TV series)|Just William]]'' (playing [[Violet Elizabeth Bott]]), the 1974 Broadway revival of ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' starring [[Angela Lansbury]], the 1976 film ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'', and the 1977 film ''[[Wombling Free]]''. During this time, she was appearing as a regular on a children's prime-time show made by [[Yorkshire Television]] called ''[[Junior Showtime]]'', along with child stars [[Lena Zavaroni]], [[Neil Reid]] and Glynn Poole among others. Langford appeared as [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s daughter in the London production of ''[[Scarlett (musical)|Scarlett]]'' (1972).<ref>Kit Hesketh-Harvey in  ''Country Life'', 22 January 2014, page 32</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===''Doctor Who''===\n{{main|Doctor Who}}\nBetween 1986 and 1987, Langford played the role of [[Melanie Bush|Mel]], companion to both the [[Sixth Doctor|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] Doctors in the classic science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. She returned to the role in 1993 for ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', a special charity ''[[Doctor Who]]''/''[[EastEnders]]'' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode as part of the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Children in Need]]''. She has continued to reprise the role in several [[radio drama|audio dramas]] alongside the Colin Baker and McCoy Doctors.<ref name= \"bigfinish\">{{cite news |last= |first= |url= https://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/mel-bush-big-finish-feature |title=Mel Bush at Big Finish |work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]] |date= |accessdate=2018-01-10}}</ref>\n\n===Dancing===\nLangford was a featured dancer in [[BBC One]]'s popular [[light entertainment]] series ''The Hot Shoe Show'' which she co-presented with [[Wayne Sleep]]. On 23 October 2005, she performed in ''[[Children Will Listen]]'', a 75th birthday tribute to [[Stephen Sondheim]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. She is also a [[Pantomime|panto]] regular; recent credits include Peter in ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'' at the [[Richmond Theatre]] in Surrey (2008\u20132009); and Fairy Snow in ''[[Cinderella]]'' at the [[Yvonne Arnaud Theatre]] in [[Guildford]] (2013\u20132014).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===''Dancing on Ice''===\n{{main|Dancing on Ice}}\nIn 2006, Langford was a celebrity contestant in the first series of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', partnering professional [[Figure skating|figure skater]] [[Matt Evers]]. Their routines were characterised by the dramatic lifts and tricks they performed and were amongst the most ambitious in the competitions. Viewers saw her bang her head as she was spun on the ice during rehearsals, illustrating the danger of some of the moves they were attempting. Their appearances were also notable for the differing reception they received from the panel of judges (which consistently voted them highly, awarding them the highest total scores and the only two maximum scores from individual judges) and the voting public (who twice placed them in the bottom two pairs, forcing a \"skate off\" to remain in the competition). They finished in third place overall.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nLangford and Evers appeared again on the programme in the one-off ''Champion of Champions'' show which followed series two. They were scored second overall by the judging panel but again the public vote was less favourable and they were amongst the four teams eliminated in the first round of the competition. Langford then toured with ''[[Torvill and Dean]]'s [[Dancing on Ice: The Tour]]'' in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nLangford took part in the [[Dancing on Ice: The Tour]] in April and May 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dancingonicetour.co.uk/bonnie.html|title=Dancing on Ice Live Tour - Past Celebrities - Bonnie Langford|work=dancingonicetour.co.uk|access-date=28 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221152155/http://www.dancingonicetour.co.uk/bonnie.html|archive-date=21 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Bonnie returned to ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' for the ninth and final series (10 Week run), which saw the favourite celebrities from previous series. This time she was partnered with professional ice skater [[Andrei Lipanov]]. She was eliminated in Week 5 after losing out to [[Sam Attwater]] and his fianc\u00e9 [[Vicky Ogden]]. In February 2014 she was announced as one of eight celebrities that would be appearing in Torvill & Deans Dancing on Ice: The Final Tour between March & April 2014.\n\n===Since ''Dancing on Ice''===\nLangford's appearance on ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' sparked a regeneration in her career. She returned to the West End theatre in 2006 playing the role of [[Roxie Hart]] in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Langford appeared in the [[Birmingham]] and [[Plymouth]] tours of ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' playing Miss Adelaide Adams, a dance hall hostess.\n\nIn July 2007, Langford was a judge on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series ''[[Baby Ballroom: The Championship]]''.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, she again appeared in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' as [[Roxie Hart]].\n\nLangford played the role of Roz in the first UK tour production of the Broadway musical, ''[[9 to 5 (musical)|9 to 5]]'', which was launched at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]], Manchester on 12 October 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cast: Bonnie Langford clocks in for ''9 to 5: The Musical''|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/west-end-theatre/news/06-2012/cast-bonnie-langford-clocks-in-for-9-to-5-the-musi_3659.html|work=Whatsonstage|publisher=(Whatsonstage)|accessdate=29 June 2012|date=29 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 she took over the leading role of Dorothy Brock in the [[42nd_Street_(musical)#West_End_revival_\u2013_2017|West End revival of 42nd Street]], until the show closed on January 5, 2019<ref>{{Cite news| last1 = Wood |first1 = Alex | last2 = Hewis |first2 = Ben| date=13 July 2018|url=https://www.whatsonstage.com/west-end-theatre/news/42nd-street-cast-bonnie-langford-closing-date_47098.html|title=Bonnie Langford joins cast of 42nd Street and closing date announced|website=Whatsonstage.com|access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref>; a recording from the end of the 2018 run aired as part of PBS's [[Great Performances]]\u2019 third annual \u201cBroadway\u2019s Best\u201d lineup in November 2019.<ref name=\"pbs\">{{cite web |title=42nd Street: About |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/42nd-street-about/10038/ |website=Great Performances |publisher=PBS |accessdate=6 November 2019 |date=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''EastEnders''===\nOn 5 April 2015, it was announced that Langford had joined long-running [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' for a guest role, later promoted to a regular role as character [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Carmel Kazemi|Carmel Kazemi]], the mother of established character, [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]).

She came to prominence as a child star in the 1970s, including a notable role in the TV series ''[[Just William (1977 TV series)|Just William]]''. In the 1980s, she played companion [[Mel Bush]] in ''[[Doctor Who]]''. She has also been known for appearing in various musicals in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], including shows such as ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. From 2015 to 2018, she portrayed the role of [[Carmel Kazemi]] on the [[BBC One|BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', for which she received the [[The British Soap Awards|2016 British Soap Award]] for Best Newcomer.\n\n== Early career ==\nBonnie Langford attended [[the Arts Educational School]], [[St Catherine's School, Twickenham]] and the [[Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts|Italia Conti Academy stage school]]. She first came to public attention when, aged six years old, she won the talent show ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]''. This led to early fame in the television series ''[[Just William (1970s TV series)|Just William]]'' (playing [[Violet Elizabeth Bott]]), the 1974 Broadway revival of ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' starring [[Angela Lansbury]], the 1976 film ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'', and the 1977 film ''[[Wombling Free]]''. During this time, she was appearing as a regular on a children's prime-time show made by [[Yorkshire Television]] called ''[[Junior Showtime]]'', along with child stars [[Lena Zavaroni]], [[Neil Reid]] and Glynn Poole among others. Langford appeared as [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s daughter in the London production of ''[[Scarlett (musical)|Scarlett]]'' (1972).<ref>Kit Hesketh-Harvey in  ''Country Life'', 22 January 2014, page 32</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===''Doctor Who''===\n{{main|Doctor Who}}\nBetween 1986 and 1987, Langford played the role of [[Melanie Bush|Mel]], companion to both the [[Sixth Doctor|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] Doctors in the classic science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. She returned to the role in 1993 for ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', a special charity ''[[Doctor Who]]''/''[[EastEnders]]'' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode as part of the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Children in Need]]''. She has continued to reprise the role in several [[radio drama|audio dramas]] alongside the Colin Baker and McCoy Doctors.<ref name= \"bigfinish\">{{cite news |last= |first= |url= https://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/mel-bush-big-finish-feature |title=Mel Bush at Big Finish |work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]] |date= |accessdate=2018-01-10}}</ref>\n\n===Dancing===\nLangford was a featured dancer in [[BBC One]]'s popular [[light entertainment]] series ''The Hot Shoe Show'' which she co-presented with [[Wayne Sleep]]. On 23 October 2005, she performed in ''[[Children Will Listen]]'', a 75th birthday tribute to [[Stephen Sondheim]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. She is also a [[Pantomime|panto]] regular; recent credits include Peter in ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'' at the [[Richmond Theatre]] in Surrey (2008\u20132009); and Fairy Snow in ''[[Cinderella]]'' at the [[Yvonne Arnaud Theatre]] in [[Guildford]] (2013\u20132014).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===''Dancing on Ice''===\n{{main|Dancing on Ice}}\nIn 2006, Langford was a celebrity contestant in the first series of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', partnering professional [[Figure skating|figure skater]] [[Matt Evers]]. Their routines were characterised by the dramatic lifts and tricks they performed and were amongst the most ambitious in the competitions. Viewers saw her bang her head as she was spun on the ice during rehearsals, illustrating the danger of some of the moves they were attempting. Their appearances were also notable for the differing reception they received from the panel of judges (which consistently voted them highly, awarding them the highest total scores and the only two maximum scores from individual judges) and the voting public (who twice placed them in the bottom two pairs, forcing a \"skate off\" to remain in the competition). They finished in third place overall.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nLangford and Evers appeared again on the programme in the one-off ''Champion of Champions'' show which followed series two. They were scored second overall by the judging panel but again the public vote was less favourable and they were amongst the four teams eliminated in the first round of the competition. Langford then toured with ''[[Torvill and Dean]]'s [[Dancing on Ice: The Tour]]'' in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nLangford took part in the [[Dancing on Ice: The Tour]] in April and May 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dancingonicetour.co.uk/bonnie.html|title=Dancing on Ice Live Tour - Past Celebrities - Bonnie Langford|work=dancingonicetour.co.uk|access-date=28 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221152155/http://www.dancingonicetour.co.uk/bonnie.html|archive-date=21 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Bonnie returned to ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' for the ninth and final series (10 Week run), which saw the favourite celebrities from previous series. This time she was partnered with professional ice skater [[Andrei Lipanov]]. She was eliminated in Week 5 after losing out to [[Sam Attwater]] and his fianc\u00e9 [[Vicky Ogden]]. In February 2014 she was announced as one of eight celebrities that would be appearing in Torvill & Deans Dancing on Ice: The Final Tour between March & April 2014.\n\n===Since ''Dancing on Ice''===\nLangford's appearance on ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' sparked a regeneration in her career. She returned to the West End theatre in 2006 playing the role of [[Roxie Hart]] in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Langford appeared in the [[Birmingham]] and [[Plymouth]] tours of ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' playing Miss Adelaide Adams, a dance hall hostess.\n\nIn July 2007, Langford was a judge on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series ''[[Baby Ballroom: The Championship]]''.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, she again appeared in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' as [[Roxie Hart]].\n\nLangford played the role of Roz in the first UK tour production of the Broadway musical, ''[[9 to 5 (musical)|9 to 5]]'', which was launched at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]], Manchester on 12 October 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cast: Bonnie Langford clocks in for ''9 to 5: The Musical''|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/west-end-theatre/news/06-2012/cast-bonnie-langford-clocks-in-for-9-to-5-the-musi_3659.html|work=Whatsonstage|publisher=(Whatsonstage)|accessdate=29 June 2012|date=29 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 she took over the leading role of Dorothy Brock in the [[42nd_Street_(musical)#West_End_revival_\u2013_2017|West End revival of 42nd Street]], until the show closed on January 5, 2019<ref>{{Cite news| last1 = Wood |first1 = Alex | last2 = Hewis |first2 = Ben| date=13 July 2018|url=https://www.whatsonstage.com/west-end-theatre/news/42nd-street-cast-bonnie-langford-closing-date_47098.html|title=Bonnie Langford joins cast of 42nd Street and closing date announced|website=Whatsonstage.com|access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref>; a recording from the end of the 2018 run aired as part of PBS's [[Great Performances]]\u2019 third annual \u201cBroadway\u2019s Best\u201d lineup in November 2019.<ref name=\"pbs\">{{cite web |title=42nd Street: About |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/42nd-street-about/10038/ |website=Great Performances |publisher=PBS |accessdate=6 November 2019 |date=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''EastEnders''===\nOn 5 April 2015, it was announced that Langford had joined long-running [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' for a guest role, later promoted to a regular role as character [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Carmel Kazemi|Carmel Kazemi]], the mother of established character, [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]).
