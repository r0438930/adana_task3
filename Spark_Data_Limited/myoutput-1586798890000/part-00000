Social Psychologist Solomon Asch was a pioneer in Gestalt Psychology. He is credited with the seminal research on impression formation and conducted research on how individuals integrate information about personality traits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impression Formation, Theories Of|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/estpsychtheory/impression_formation_theories_of|publisher=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref> Two major theories have been proposed to explain how this process of integration takes place. The Gestalt approach views the formation of a general impression as the sum of several interrelated impressions. As an individual seeks to form a coherent and meaningful impression of another individual, previous impressions significantly influence the interpretation of subsequent information.<ref name=\"HamiltonSherman1996\">{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=David L.|author2=Sherman, Steven J.|title=Perceiving persons and groups|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1996|volume=103|issue=2|pages=336\u2013355|issn=1939-1471|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.336|pmid=8637962}}</ref> In contrast to the Gestalt approach, the cognitive algebra approach asserts that individuals' experiences are combined with previous evaluations to form a constantly changing impression of a person.<ref name=\"Himmelfarb1972\">{{cite journal|last=Himmelfarb|first=Samuel|title=Integration and attribution theories in personality impression formation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1972|volume=23|issue=3|pages=309\u2013313|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/h0033126|pmid=5070314}}</ref> A related area to impression formation is the study of [[person perception]], making [[dispositional attribution]]s, and then adjusting those inferences based on the information available.<ref name=\"GilbertPelham1988\">{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert|first1=Daniel T.|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett W.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|title=On cognitive busyness: When person perceivers meet persons perceived.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1988|volume=54|issue=5|pages=733\u2013740|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.733}}</ref>\n\n==Methods==\nImpression formation has traditionally been studied using three methods pioneered by Asch: [[free response]], [[free association (psychology)|free association]], and a check-list form. In addition, a fourth method based on a [[Likert scale]] with anchors such as \u201cvery favorable\u201d and \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d, has also been used in recent research.<ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\">{{cite journal|title=Dispositional Attribution: Multiple Inferences About Motive-Related Traits|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2004|volume=86|issue=4|pages=530\u2013544|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.4.530|pmid=15053704|last1=Reeder|first1=Glenn D.|last2=Vonk|first2=Roos|last3=Ronk|first3=Marla J.|last4=Ham|first4=Jaap|last5=Lawrence|first5=Melissa|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.2048}}</ref> A combination of some or all of these techniques is often employed to produce the most accurate assessment of impression formation.\n\n===Free response===\n[[Free response]] is an experimental method frequently used in impression formation research. The participant (or perceiver) is presented with a stimulus (usually a short vignette or a list of personality descriptors such as ''assured, talkative, cold,'' etc.) and then instructed to briefly sketch his or her impressions of the type of person described. This is a useful technique for gathering detailed and concrete evidence on the nature of the impression formed. However, the difficulty of accurately coding responses often necessitates the use of additional quantitative measures.<ref name=\"Asch1946\">{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S.

While this produces an easily quantifiable assessment of an impression, it forces participants' answers into a limited, and often extreme, response set.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> However, when used in conjunction with the above-mentioned techniques, check-list data provides useful information about the character of impressions.\n\n===Likert-type rating scales===\nWith [[Likert scale]]s, perceivers are responding to a presentation of discrete personality characteristics.

In general, primacy can have three main effects: initial trait-information can be integrated into an individual's global impression of a person in a process of ''[[assimilation effects]],'' it can lead to a durable impression against which other information is compared in a process of ''[[anchoring]],'' and it can cause people to actively change their perception of others in a process of ''correction.''<ref name=DeCoster/>\n\n===Valence===\nThe emotionality of certain personality traits, such as \"warm\" versus \"cold\" characteristics, can influence how subsequent traits are interpreted and ultimately the type of impression formed.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> Information inconsistent with a person's global impression of another individual is especially prominent in memory. The process of assimilation can lead to causal attributions of personality as this inconsistent information is integrated into the whole.<ref name=Heider>{{cite journal|last=Heider|first=F.|title=Social perception and phenomenal causality.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1944|volume=51|issue=6|pages=358\u2013374|doi=10.1037/h0055425}}</ref> This effect is especially influential when the behavior is perceived as negative.

The recondite exchange typified a continuing debate between proponents of [[contextualism]] who argue that impressions result from situationally specific influences (e.g., from [[semantics]] and [[nonverbal communication]] as well as [[affective science|affective]] factors), and modelers who follow the [[pragmatic maxim]], seeking [[approximation]]s revealing core mental processes.

''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967)</ref> focused on how individuals engage in [[impression management]]. Using the notion of ''face'' as ''[[identity (social science)|identity]]'' is used now, Goffman proposed that individuals maintain face expressively. \"By entering a situation in which he is given a face to maintain, a person takes on the responsibility of standing guard over the flow of events as they pass before him. He must ensure that a particular expressive order is sustained-an order that regulates the flow of events, large or small, so that anything that appears to be expressed by them will be consistent with his face.\"<ref>Goffman, E. ''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967), p. 9</ref> In other words, individuals control events so as to create desired impressions of themselves. Goffman emphasized that individuals in a group operate as a ''[[team]]'' with everyone committed to helping others maintain their identities.<ref>Goffman, E., 1959</ref>\n\n==Impression-formation processes in the US==\nRatings of 515 action descriptions by American respondents yielded estimations of a [[statistical model]] consisting of nine impression-formation equations, predicting outcome Evaluation, Potency, and Activity of actor, behavior, and object from pre-event ratings of the evaluation, potency, and activity of actor, behavior, and object.<ref>[[Maximum likelihood|Maximum-likelihood estimations]] are reported in Smith-Lovin, Lynn. \"Impressions from events,\" pp. 35\u201370 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>\n\nStability was a factor in every equation, with some pre-action feeling toward an action element transferred to post-action feeling about the same element. Evaluation, Potency, and Activity of behaviors suffused to actors so impressions of actors were determined in part by the behaviors they performed. In general objects of action lost Potency.\n\nInteractions among variables included consistency effects, such as receiving Evaluative credit for performing a bad behavior toward a bad object person, and congruency effects, such as receiving evaluative credit for nice behaviors toward weak objects or bad behaviors toward powerful objects. Third-order interactions included a balance effect in which actors received a boost in evaluation if two or none of the elements in the action were negative, otherwise a decrement. Across all nine prediction equations, more than half of the 64 possible predictors (first-order variables plus second- Dand third-order interactions) contributed to outcomes.<ref>Impression-formation effects are described in detail by Heise, D. R. ''Expressive Order'', Chapter 6. [[Ordinary least squares]] estimations of equations from the 515-event study, and from studies mentioned below, can be examined in [http://www.indiana.edu/~socpsy/ACT/interact/JavaInteract.html Interact On-Line (Java applet)]</ref>\n\nStudies of event descriptions that explicitly specified [[behavior settings]] found that impression-formation processes are largely the same when settings are salient, but the setting becomes an additional contributor to impression formation regarding actor, behavior, and object; and the action changes the impression of the setting.<ref>Smith-Lovin, Lynn (1979). \"Behavior settings and impressions formed from social scenarios\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''42''': 31\u201343; Smith-Lovin, L. \"The affective control of events within settings,\" pp. 71\u2013102 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>\n\nActor and object are the same person in self-directed actions such as \"the lawyer praised himself\" or various kinds of [[self-harm]]. Impression-formation research<ref>Britt, Lory, and D. R. Heise (1992). \"Impressions of self-directed action.\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''55''': 335\u2013350</ref> indicates that self-directed actions reduce the positivity of actors on the Evaluation, Potency, and Activity dimensions. Self-directed actions therefore are not an optimal way to confirm the good, potent, lively identities that people normally want to maintain. Rather self-directed actions are a likely mode of expression for individuals who want to manifest their low [[self-esteem]] and [[self-efficacy]].\n\nEarly work on impression formation<ref>Gollob, 1968; Gollob and Rossman, 1973</ref> used action sentences like, \"The kind man praises communists,\" and \"Bill helped the corrupt senator,\" assuming that modifier-noun combinations amalgamate into a functional unit. A later study<ref>Averett, Christine P., and D. R. Heise. \"Modified social identities: Amalgamations, attributions, and emotions,\" pp. 103\u2013132 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref> found that a modifier-noun combination does form an overall impression that works in action descriptions like a noun alone. The action sentences in that study combined identities with status characteristics, [[Trait theory|traits]], [[mood (psychology)|moods]], and [[emotion]]s. Another study<ref>Heise, D. R., and Lisa Thomas (1989). \"Predicting impressions created by combinations of emotion and social identity\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''52''': 141\u2013148.</ref> focused specifically on emotion descriptors combined with identities (e.g., an angry child) and again found that emotion terms amalgamate with identities, and equations describing this kind of amalgamation are of the same form as equations describing trait-identity amalgamation.\n\n==Cross-cultural studies==\nStudies of various kinds of impression formation have been conducted in Canada,<ref>MacKinnon, Neil J.

For example, in every culture that has been studied, Evaluation of an actor was determined by-among other things-a stability effect, a suffusion from the behavior Evaluation, and an interaction that rewarded an actor for performing a behavior whose Evaluation was consistent with the Evaluation of the object person.\n\nOn the other hand, each culture weighted the core effects distinctively. For example, the impact of behavior-object Evaluation consistency was much smaller in Germany than in the United States, Canada, or Japan, suggesting that [[Morality|moral]] judgments of actors have a somewhat different basis in Germany than in the other cultures. Additionally, impression-formation processes involved some unique interactions in each culture. For example, attribute-identity amalgamations in Germany involved some Potency and Activity interactions that did not appear in other cultures.\n\nA book, ''Surveying Cultures''<ref>Heise, D. R. ''Surveying Cultures: Discovering Shared Conceptions and Sentiments'' (Wiley Interscience, 2010)</ref> reviewed [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural research]] on impression-formation processes, and provided guidelines for conducting impression-formation studies in cultures where the processes are unexplored currently.\n\n== Recent Studies ==\nImpression formation is based on the characteristics of both the perceivers and targets. However, research has not been able to quantify the extent to which these two groups contribute to impression.

Social Psychologist Solomon Asch was a pioneer in Gestalt Psychology. He is credited with the seminal research on impression formation and conducted research on how individuals integrate information about personality traits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impression Formation, Theories Of|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/estpsychtheory/impression_formation_theories_of|publisher=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref> Two major theories have been proposed to explain how this process of integration takes place. The Gestalt approach views the formation of a general impression as the sum of several interrelated impressions. As an individual seeks to form a coherent and meaningful impression of another individual, previous impressions significantly influence the interpretation of subsequent information.<ref name=\"HamiltonSherman1996\">{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=David L.|author2=Sherman, Steven J.|title=Perceiving persons and groups|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1996|volume=103|issue=2|pages=336\u2013355|issn=1939-1471|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.336|pmid=8637962}}</ref> In contrast to the Gestalt approach, the cognitive algebra approach asserts that individuals' experiences are combined with previous evaluations to form a constantly changing impression of a person.<ref name=\"Himmelfarb1972\">{{cite journal|last=Himmelfarb|first=Samuel|title=Integration and attribution theories in personality impression formation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1972|volume=23|issue=3|pages=309\u2013313|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/h0033126|pmid=5070314}}</ref> A related area to impression formation is the study of [[person perception]], making [[dispositional attribution]]s, and then adjusting those inferences based on the information available.<ref name=\"GilbertPelham1988\">{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert|first1=Daniel T.|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett W.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|title=On cognitive busyness: When person perceivers meet persons perceived.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1988|volume=54|issue=5|pages=733\u2013740|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.733}}</ref>\n\n==Methods==\nImpression formation has traditionally been studied using three methods pioneered by Asch: [[free response]], [[free association (psychology)|free association]], and a check-list form. In addition, a fourth method based on a [[Likert scale]] with anchors such as \u201cvery favorable\u201d and \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d, has also been used in recent research.<ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\">{{cite journal|title=Dispositional Attribution: Multiple Inferences About Motive-Related Traits|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2004|volume=86|issue=4|pages=530\u2013544|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.4.530|pmid=15053704|last1=Reeder|first1=Glenn D.|last2=Vonk|first2=Roos|last3=Ronk|first3=Marla J.|last4=Ham|first4=Jaap|last5=Lawrence|first5=Melissa|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.2048}}</ref> A combination of some or all of these techniques is often employed to produce the most accurate assessment of impression formation.\n\n===Free response===\n[[Free response]] is an experimental method frequently used in impression formation research. The participant (or perceiver) is presented with a stimulus (usually a short vignette or a list of personality descriptors such as ''assured, talkative, cold,'' etc.) and then instructed to briefly sketch his or her impressions of the type of person described. This is a useful technique for gathering detailed and concrete evidence on the natur of the impression formed. However, the difficulty of accurately coding responses often necessitates the use of additional quantitative measures.<ref name=\"Asch1946\">{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S.

While this produces an easily quantifiable assessment of an impression, it forces participants' answers into a limited, and often extreme, response set.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> However, when used in conjunction with the above-mentioned techniques, check-list data provides useful information about the character of impressions.\n\n===Likert-type rating scales===\nWith [[Likert scale]]s, perceivers are responding to a presentation of discrete personality characteristics.

In general, primacy can have three main effects: initial trait-information can be integrated into an individual's global impression of a person in a process of ''[[assimilation effects]],'' it can lead to a durable impression against which other information is compared in a process of ''[[anchoring]],'' and it can cause people to actively change their perception of others in a process of ''correction.''<ref name=DeCoster/>\n\n===Valence===\nThe emotionality of certain personality traits, such as \"warm\" versus \"cold\" characteristics, can influence how subsequent traits are interpreted and ultimately the type of impression formed.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> Information inconsistent with a person's global impression of another individual is especially prominent in memory. The process of assimilation can lead to causal attributions of personality as this inconsistent information is integrated into the whole.<ref name=Heider>{{cite journal|last=Heider|first=F.|title=Social perception and phenomenal causality.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1944|volume=51|issue=6|pages=358\u2013374|doi=10.1037/h0055425}}</ref> This effect is especially influential when the behavior is perceived as negative.

''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967)</ref> focused on how individuals engage in [[impression management]]. Using the notion of ''face'' as ''[[identity (social science)|identity]]'' is used now, Goffman proposed that individuals maintain face expressively. \"By entering a situation in which he is given a face to maintain, a person takes on the responsibility of standing guard over the flow of events as they pass before him. He must ensure that a particular expressive order is sustained-an order that regulates the flow of events, large or small, so that anything that appears to be expressed by them will be consistent with his face.\"<ref>Goffman, E. ''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967), p. 9</ref> In other words, individuals control events so as to create desired impressions of themselves.

Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>\n\nStability was a factor in every equation, with some pre-action feeling toward an action element transferred to post-action feeling about the same element. Evaluation, Potency, and Activity of behaviors suffused to actors so impressions of actors were determined in part by the behaviors they performed. In general objects of action lost Potency.\n\nInteractions among variables included consistency effects, such as receiving Evaluative credit for performing a bad behavior toward a bad object person, and congruency effects, such as receiving evaluative credit for nice behaviors toward weak objects or bad behaviors toward powerful objects. Third-order interactions included a balance effect in which actors received a boost in evaluation if two or none of the elements in the action were negative, otherwise a decrement. Across all nine prediction equations, more than half of the 64 possible predictors (first-order variables plus second- Dand third-order interactions) contributed to outcomes.<ref>Impression-formation effects are described in detail by Heise, D. R. ''Expressive Order'', Chapter 6. [[Ordinary least squares]] estimations of equations from the 515-event study, and from studies mentioned below, can be examined in [http://www.indiana.edu/~socpsy/ACT/interact/JavaInteract.html Interact On-Line (Java applet)]</ref>\n\nStudies of event descriptions that explicitly specified [[behavior settings]] found that impression-formation processes are largely the same when settings are salient, but the setting becomes an additional contributor to impression formation regarding actor, behavior, and object; and the action changes the impression of the setting.<ref>Smith-Lovin, Lynn (1979). \"Behavior settings and impressions formed from social scenarios\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''42''': 31\u201343; Smith-Lovin, L. \"The affective control of events within settings,\" pp. 71\u2013102 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>\n\nActor and object are the same person in self-directed actions such as \"the lawyer praised himself\" or various kinds of [[self-harm]]. Impression-formation research<ref>Britt, Lory, and D. R. Heise (1992). \"Impressions of self-directed action.\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''55''': 335\u2013350</ref> indicates that self-directed actions reduce the positivity of actors on the Evaluation, Potency, and Activity dimensions. Self-directed actions therefore are not an optimal way to confirm the good, potent, lively identities that people normally want to maintain. Rather self-directed actions are a likely mode of expression for individuals who want to manifest their low [[self-esteem]] and [[self-efficacy]].\n\nEarly work on impression formation<ref>Gollob, 1968; Gollob and Rossman, 1973</ref> used action sentences like, \"The kind man praises communists,\" and \"Bill helped the corrupt senator,\" assuming that modifier-noun combinations amalgamate into a functional unit. A later study<ref>Averett, Christine P., and D. R. Heise. \"Modified social identities: Amalgamations, attributions, and emotions,\" pp. 103\u2013132 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref> found that a modifier-noun combination does form an overall impression that works in action descriptions like a noun alone. The action sentences in that study combined identities with status characteristics, [[Trait theory|traits]], [[mood (psychology)|moods]], and [[emotion]]s. Another study<ref>Heise, D. R., and Lisa Thomas (1989). \"Predicting impressions created by combinations of emotion and social identity\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''52''': 141\u2013148.</ref> focused specifically on emotion descriptors combined with identities (e.g., an angry child) and again found that emotion terms amalgamate with identities, and equations describing this kind of amalgamation are of the same form as equations describing trait-identity amalgamation.\n\n==Cross-cultural studies==\nStudies of various kinds of impression formation have been conducted in Canada,<ref>MacKinnon, Neil J.

For example, in every culture that has been studied, Evaluation of an actor was determined by-among other things-a stability effect, a suffusion from the behavior Evaluation, and an interaction that rewarded an actor for performing a behavior whose Evaluation was consistent with the Evaluation of the object person.\n\nOn the other hand, each culture weighted the core effects distinctively. For example, the impact of behavior-object Evaluation consistency was much smaller in Germany than in the United States, Canada, or Japan, suggesting that [[Morality|moral]] judgments of actors have a somewhat different basis in Germany than in the other cultures. Additionally, impression-formation processes involved some unique interactions in each culture. For example, attribute-identity amalgamations in Germany involved some Potency and Activity interactions that did not appear in other cultures.\n\nA book, ''Surveying Cultures''<ref>Heise, D. R. ''Surveying Cultures: Discovering Shared Conceptions and Sentiments'' (Wiley Interscience, 2010)</ref> reviewed [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural research]] on impression-formation processes, and provided guidelines for conducting impression-formation studies in cultures where the processes are unexplored currently.\n\n== Recent Studies ==\nImpression formation is based on the characteristics of both the perceivers and targets. However, research has not been able to quantify the extent to which these two groups contribute to impression. Research was conducted to determine the extent of how impressions originate from \u2018our mind\u2019 and \u2018target face\u2019. Results demonstrated that perceiver characteristics contribute more than target appearance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=Sally Y.|last2=Flake|first2=Jessica K.|last3=Hehman|first3=Eric|date=August 2019|title=Perceiver and target characteristics contribute to impression formation differently across race and gender.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=117|issue=2|pages=364\u2013385|doi=10.1037/pspi0000160|pmid=30550328|issn=1939-1315|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ac7512497a2289f7fc543d39eb5eec7d48468a9}}</ref> Impressions can be made from facial appearance alone and assessments on attributes such as nice, strong, and smart based on variations of the targets\u2019 face. The results show that subtle facial traits have meaningful consequences on impressions, which is true even for young children of 3 years old.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=Tessa E.

Research reveals that social goals are capable of driving the formation of impressions and that there exists flexibility in the possible impressions formed on target faces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Collova|first=Jemma R.|last2=Sutherland|first2=Clare A.
