At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 60, based on 9 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\nSteve 'Flash' Juon of ''RapReviews'' praised the album's production for its bass-heavy underground approach and Canibus' lyrics for containing more vile and vitriol than his debut's pop rap content, saying that, \"As a whole this sophomore album is easily as good or better than the first, but whether this will satisfy the people who've already written off Canibus is still anyone's guess.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> [[Nathan Rabin]] of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', despite finding the production uneven, the featured guests lacking lyrically and the use of a song structure missing, praised Canibus for lacing the songs by amplifying his battle-rapping style with imaginative content, saying that he \"invests his rhymes with such dark humor, vivid imagery, and controlled passion that his lack of thematic ambition is forgivable.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/canibus-em2000-bcem-21826|title=2000 B.C. \u00b7 Canibus|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|authorlink=Nathan Rabin|newspaper=[[The A.V.
