Chisel-cut materials have also been found.\n\n==Woodworking{{Anchor|Woodworking chisels}}==\n[[Image:Wood chisel.JPG|thumb|right|A sharp wood chisel in combination with a [[Forstner bit|forstner]] wood drill bit is used to form this mortise for a half-lap joint in a timber frame.]]\nWoodworking chisels range from small hand tools for tiny details, to large chisels used to remove big sections of wood, in 'roughing out' the shape of a pattern or design.  Typically, in [[Wood carving|woodcarving]], one starts with a larger tool, and gradually progresses to smaller tools to finish the detail.  One of the largest types of chisel is the [[Framing Slick|slick]], used in [[Timber framing|timber frame]] [[construction]] and wooden shipbuilding. There are many types of woodworking chisels used for specific purposes, such as:\n; Firmer chisel : has a blade with a thick rectangular cross section, making them stronger for use on tougher and heavier work.\n; Bevel edge chisel : can get into acute angles with its bevelled edges.\n; Mortise chisel : thick, rigid blade with straight cutting edge and deep, slightly tapered sides to make [[mortise and tenon|mortises]] and similar joints.\n; Paring chisel : has a long blade ideal for cleaning grooves and accessing tight spaces.\n; Skew chisel : has a 60 degree cutting angle and is used for trimming and finishing across the grain.\n; Dovetail chisel : made specifically for cutting [[dovetail]] joints. The difference being the thickness of the body of the chisel, as well as the angle of the edges, permitting easier access to the joint.\n; Butt chisel : short chisel with beveled sides and straight edge for creating joints.\n; Carving chisels : used for intricate designs and sculpting; cutting edges are many; such as gouge, skew, parting, straight, paring, and V-groove. \n; Corner chisel : resembles a punch and has an L-shaped cutting edge. Cleans out square holes, mortises and corners with 90 degree angles.\n; Flooring chisel : cuts and lifts flooring materials for removal and repair; ideal for tongue-and-groove flooring.\n; Framing chisel : usually used with mallet; similar to a butt chisel, except it has a longer, slightly flexible blade.\n; [[Slick (tool)|Slick]] : a very large chisel driven by manual pressure, never struck.\n\n== Lathe tools ==\nA lathe tool is a woodworking chisel designed to cut wood as it is spun on a  [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]].  These tools have longer handles for more leverage, needed to counteract the tendency of the tool to react to the downward force of the spinning wood being cut or carved. In addition, the angle and method of sharpening is different; a secondary bevel would not be ground on the tool.\n\n==Metalworking==\nChisels used in metal work can be divided into two main categories: hot chisels and cold chisels.\n\n===Cold chisel===\n[[Image:ColdChisels.jpg|thumb|Top: Bull point chisel<br />Bottom: Cold chisel]]\t\n\nA cold chisel is a tool made of [[tempered steel]] used for cutting 'cold' metals,<ref name=EB1911/> meaning that they are not used in conjunction with heating torches, forges, etc. Cold chisels are used to remove waste metal when a very smooth finish is not required or when the work cannot be done easily with other tools, such as a hacksaw, file, bench shears or power tools.\n\nThe name cold chisel comes from its use by blacksmiths to cut metal while it was cold as compared to other tools they used to cut hot metal. Because cold chisels are used to form metal, they have a less-acute angle to the sharp portion of the blade than a woodworking chisel. This gives the cutting edge greater strength at the expense of sharpness.\n\nCold chisels come in a variety of sizes, from fine engraving tools that are tapped with very light hammers, to massive tools that are driven with [[sledgehammer]]s. Cold chisels are forged to shape and hardened and tempered (to a blue colour) at the cutting edge.\n \nThe head of the chisel is chamfered to slow down the formation of the mushroom shape caused by hammering and is left soft to avoid brittle fracture splintering from hammer blows.\n\nThere are four common types of cold chisels. These are the '''flat chisel''', the most widely known type, which is used to cut bars and rods to reduce surfaces and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with [[tin snips]]. The '''cross cut chisel''' is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The '''round nose chisel''' is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The '''diamond point chisel''' is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of cold chisels are made of steel, a few are manufactured from [[beryllium copper]], for use in special situations where non-[[Ember|sparking]] tools are required.\n\nCold Chisels are predominantly used in [[Repouss\u00e9 and chasing]] processes for the fabrication of [[bronze]] and [[aluminium]] [[sculptures]].\n\n===Hot chisel===\nA hot chisel is used to cut metal that has been heated in a [[forge]] to soften the metal. One type of hot chisel is the ''hotcut hardy'', which is used in an [[anvil]] [[hardy hole]] with the cutting edge facing up. The hot workpiece to be cut is placed over the chisel and struck with a hammer. The hammer drives the workpiece into the chisel, which allows it to be snapped off with a pair of [[tongs]]. This tool is also often used in combination with a \"top fuller\" type of hotcut, when the piece being cut is particularly large.\n\n==Stone==\n[[File:Tandijzer.jpg|thumb|120px|A toothed stone chisel, used by [[stone sculpture|stone sculptors]] and [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]]]]\n\nStone chisels are used to carve or cut stone, bricks or concrete slabs. To cut, as opposed to carve, a brick bolster is used; this has a wide, flat blade that is tapped along the cut line to produce a groove, then hit hard in the centre to crack the stone. [[Sculptors]] use a ''spoon chisel'', which is bent, with the bevel on both sides. To increase the force, stone chisels are often hit with [[lump hammer|club hammer]]s, a heavier type of hammer.\n\n==Masonry==\n[[Image:Bolster chisel.jpg|thumb|right|A bolster chisel]]\n\nMasonry chisels are typically heavy, with a relatively dull head that wedges and breaks, rather than cuts. Often used as a demolition tool, they may be mounted on a [[hammer drill]], [[jack hammer]], or hammered manually, usually with a heavy hammer of three pounds or more.  These chisels normally have an [[Drill bit shank|SDS]], [[Drill bit shank|SDS-MAX]], or [[Jackhammer|1-1/8\" Hex]] connection.  Types of masonry chisels include the following:<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Choosing%20the%20Right%20Jackhammer%20Tool%20for%20the%20Job_tcm45-346742.pdf\n | title = Choosing the Right Jackhammer Tool for the Job\n | accessdate = 2013-09-22\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927072505/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Choosing%20the%20Right%20Jackhammer%20Tool%20for%20the%20Job_tcm45-346742.pdf\n | archive-date = 2013-09-27\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\n\n* Moil (point) chisels \n* Flat chisels \n* Asphalt cutters \n* Carbide bushing tools \n* Clay spade \n* Flexible chisels \n* Tamper\n\nA ''plugging chisel'' has a tapered edge for cleaning out hardened [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The chisel is held with one hand and struck with a hammer. The direction of the taper in the blade determines if the chisel cuts deep or runs shallow along the joint.\n\n== Gouge ==\n[[File: Carving tools 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Different gouges and a wooden mallet]]\nA modern gouge is similar to a chisel except its blade edge is not flat, but instead is curved or angled in cross-section. The modern version is generally [[hafting|hafted]] inline, the blade and handle typically having the same long axis.  If the bevel of the blade is on the outer surface of the curve the gouge is called an 'out-cannel' gouge, otherwise, it is known as an 'in cannel' gouge. Gouges with angled rather than curved blades are often called 'V-gouges' or 'vee-parting tools'.\n\nThe blade geometry is defined by a semi-standardized numbering system that varies by manufacturer and country of origin. For each gouge a \"sweep number\" is specified that expresses the part of a circle defined by the curve of the blade. The sweep number usually ranges from #1, or flat, up to #9, a semi-circle, with additional specialized gouges at higher numbers, such as the U-shaped #11, and a v-tool or parting tool, which may be an even higher number such as #41. In addition to sweep, gouges are also specified by the distance from one edge of the blade to the other (this corresponds to the chord of the circle section defined by the edge of the blade). Putting these pieces together, two numbers are used to specify the shape of the cutting edge of a gouge, such as a '#7-20mm'. Some manufacturers provide charts with the sweeps of their blades shown graphically.\n\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Stubai Gouge Chart.pdf|thumbnail|Stubai Gouge Chart, showing the cutting edge profiles of gouges offered by this manufacturer.]] -->\nIn addition to varying blade sweeps, bevels, and widths, blade variations include:\n* 'Crank-neck' gouges, in which the blade is offset from the handle by a small distance, to allow working flat to a surface\n* 'Spoon-bent' gouges, in which the blade is curved along its length, to allow working in a hollow not otherwise accessible with a straight bladed gouge\n* 'Fishtail' gouges, in which the blade is very narrow for most of its length and then broadens out near the working edge, to allow working in tight spaces.\nAll of these specialized gouges allow a craftsperson to cut into areas that may not be possible with a regular, straight-bladed gouge.\n\nThe cutting shape of a gouge may also be held in an [[adze]], roughly as the shape of a modern-day mattock. \n\nGouges are used in woodworking and arts. For example, a violin luthier uses gouges to carve the violin, a cabinetmaker may use it for running flutes or paring curves,<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.woodcarvingworkshops.tv/videos/tools-equipment/'true-gouges'\n | title = 'True' Gouges\n | accessdate = 2014-11-01\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141101225324/http://www.woodcarvingworkshops.tv/videos/tools-equipment/'true-gouges'\n | archive-date = 2014-11-01\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> or an artist may produce a piece of art by cutting some bits out of a sheet of [[linoleum]] (see also [[Linocut]]).\n\nGouges were found at a number of [[List of Bronze Age hoards in Great Britain|historic Bronze Age hoards found in Great Britain]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Burin (engraving)|Burin}}\n* {{annotated link|Digging bar}}\n* {{annotated link|Slick (tool)}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.liutaiomottola.com/Tools/SharpenGouge.htm Sharpening, Honing and Polishing Gouges and Other Carving Tools]\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons|Chisel|Chisels}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [[Reader's Digest]] Book of Skills & Tools {{ISBN|0-89577-469-0}}\n\n{{Cutting and abrasive tools}}\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n{{Metalworking navbox|toolopen}}\n{{Woodworking}}\n\n[[Category:Chisels| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the cutting tool|the Australian rock band 'Cold Chisel'|Cold Chisel}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[Image:Neolithic chisels 4100-2700 BC.jpg|thumb|Neolithic stone chisels from Schleswig-Holstein, Germany around 4100 to 2700 BCE]]\nA '''chisel''' is a [[tool]] with a characteristically shaped cutting edge (such that wood chisels have lent part of their name to a particular [[Grind#Typical grinds|grind]]) of [[blade]] on its end, for carving or cutting a hard material such as [[wood]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], or [[Metalworking|metal]] by hand, struck with a mallet, or  mechanical power.<ref>\"Chisel, n.1\" def. 1.a.
