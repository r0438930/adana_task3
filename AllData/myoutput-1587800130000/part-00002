At {{convert|60|mi|abbr=on}} long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the [[cathedral city]] of [[Durham, England|Durham]] and gives its name to [[Weardale]] in its upper reach and [[Wearside]] by its mouth.\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin behind the [[Hydronym|hydronym]] ''Wear'' is uncertain but is generally understood to be Celtic. The ''River Vedra'' on the Roman Map of Britain may very well be the River Wear. The name may be derived from [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*wejr'' (<''*w\u1eb9:dr\u0101''),<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> which meant \"a bend\" (c.f [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''-gwair-'').<ref name=\"BLITON\">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan G. |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence - Guide to the Elements |url=https://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary_2019_Edition.pdf |website=Scottish Place Name Society - The Brittonic Language in the Old North |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> An alternative but very problematic etymology might involve ''*w\u1eb9:d-r-'',<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> from a lengthened form of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *wed- \"water\".<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> Also suggested is a possible derivation from the Brittonic root ''*wei-'', which is thought to have meant \"to flow\".<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> The name ''Wear'' has also been explained as being an ancient Celtic name meaning \"river of blood\".<ref>{{cite web|title=North East Place Name Meanings T to Y - England's North East|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/PlaceNameMeaningsTtoY.html|website=www.englandsnortheast.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the ''Wear'' has the same etymology as the [[River Wyre]] in [[Lancashire]],<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> as well as the [[Quair Water]] in Scotland.<ref name=\"BLITON\" />\n\n==Geology==\nThe Wear rises in the east Pennines, an upland area raised up during the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. Specifically, the Weardale Granite underlies the headwaters of the Wear. Devonian [[Old Red Sandstone]] in age, this Weardale Granite does not outcrop{{#tag:ref| i.e. appear on the surface|group= n}} but was surmised by early geologists, and subsequently proven to exist as seen in the Rookhope borehole.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geology: Granite in the North Pennines |url=http://www.pastperfect.org.uk/sites/oldrookhope/archive/40.html|accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> It is the presence of this granite that has retained the high upland elevations of this area (less through its relative hardness, and more due to isostatic equilibrium) and accounts for heavy local mineralisation, although it is considered that most of the mineralisation occurred during the Carboniferous period.\n\nIt is thought that the course of the River Wear, prior to the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], was much as it is now as far as [[Chester-le-Street]]. This can be established as a result of boreholes, of which there have been many in the Wear valley due to [[coal mining]]. However, northwards from Chester-le-Street, the Wear may have originally followed the current route of the lower [[River Team]]. The last glaciation reached its peak about 18,500 years ago, from which time it also began a progressive retreat, leaving a wide variety of glacial deposits in its wake, filling existing river valleys with silt, sand and other [[Till|glacial till]]. At about 14,000 years ago, retreat of the ice paused for maybe 500 years at the city of [[Durham, England|Durham]]. This can be established by the types of glacial deposits in the vicinity of Durham City. The confluence of the [[River Browney]] was pushed from [[Gilesgate]] (the abandoned river valley still exists in Pelaw Woods), several miles south to [[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]] ([[Croxdale]]). At Chester-le-Street, when glacial [[boulder clay]] was deposited blocking its northerly course, the River Wear was diverted eastwards towards [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] where it was forced to cut a new, shallower valley. The gorge cut by the river through the [[Permian]] [[Magnesian Limestone]] can be seen most clearly at Ford Quarry. In the 17th edition of [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] (1990), reference is made to a pre-Ice Age course of the River Wear outfalling at [[Hartlepool]].\n\nThe upland area of Upper Weardale retains a flora that relates, almost uniquely in [[England]], to the end of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], although it almost or entirely lacks the particular rarities that make up the unique \"Teesdale Assemblage\" of post-glacial plants. This may, in part, be due to the [[Pennines|Pennine]] areas of Upper Weardale and Upper Teesdale being the site of the shrinking [[ice cap]]. The glaciation left behind many indications of its presence, including lateral [[moraines]] and material from the [[Lake District]] and [[Northumberland]], although surprisingly few [[drumlins]]. After the Ice Age, the Wear valley became thickly forested, however during the [[Neolithic]] period and increasingly in the [[Bronze Age]], were largely [[deforestation|deforested]] for agriculture.\n\n==Industrial history==\nMuch of the River Wear is associated with the history of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Its upper end runs through lead mining country, until this gives way to coal seams of the Durham coalfield for the rest of its length. As a result of limestone quarrying, lead mining and coal mining, the Wear valley was amongst the first places to see the development of railways. The [[Weardale Railway]] continues to run occasional services between [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] and [[Wolsingham]].\n\nMining of [[lead ore]] has been known in the area of the headwaters of the Wear since the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]] and continued into the nineteenth century. Spoil heaps from the abandoned lead mines can still be seen,{{where?|date=December 2012}} and since the last quarter of the twentieth century have been the focus of attention for the recovery of [[gangue]] minerals in present mining, such as fluorspar for the smelting of [[aluminium]].  However, abandoned mines and their spoil heaps continue to contribute to heavy metal mineral pollution of the river and its tributaries. This has significance to fishing in times of low flow and infrastructure costs as the River Wear is an important source of drinking water for many of the inhabitants along its course.\n\n[[Fluorspar]] is another mineral sporadically co-present with Weardale Granite and became important in the manufacture of steel from the late 19th century into the 20th century. In many cases the steel industries were able to take fluorspar from old excavation heaps.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Fluorspar explains why iron and steel manufacture flourished in the [[Wear Valley|Wear valley]], [[Consett]] and Teesside during the nineteenth century.  Overlying are three [[Carboniferous]] minerals: [[Carboniferous limestone|limestone]], [[Coal measure|Coal Measures]] as raw materials for iron and steel manufacture, and [[sandstone]], useful as a [[refractory material]]. The last remaining flourspar mine closed in 1999 following legislation re water quality. A mine at [[Rogerley Quarry]], Frosterley, is operated by an American consortium who occasionally work it for specimen minerals.\n\nMinco are currently exploring the North Pennines and the upper Wear catchment for potential reserves of [[zinc]] at lower levels.\n\n[[Ironstone]] which was important as the ore was won from around [[Consett]] and [[Tow Law]], then around [[Rookhope]], while greater quantities were imported from just south of the southerly [[River Tees|Tees]] in [[North Yorkshire]]. These sources were in due course depleted or became uneconomic.\n\nThe former [[cement]] works at [[Eastgate, County Durham|Eastgate]], until recently run by [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]], was based on an inlier of limestone. The site recently gained planning permission to form a visitor complex showcasing an eco-village using alternative technology, including a \"hot rocks\" water heating system. The underlying granite has been drilled and reports confirm their presence. Bardon Aggregates continue to quarry at Heights near [[Westgate, County Durham|Westgate]] and operate a tarmac \"blacktop\" plant on site.\n\nMineral extraction has also occurred above [[St John's Chapel, County Durham|St John's Chapel]] with the extraction of [[ganister]] which was used in the steel process at Consett. Around [[Frosterley]], limestone, sand (crushed sandstone) and Frosterley Marble have been worked and the Broadwood Quarry recently expanded into ground held on an old licence. The crushing plant continues to operate. A quarry at Bollihope was also mooted on a similar basis but plans seem to have been discontinued. Frosterley Marble was used extensively in church architecture, there are local examples in St Michael's church Frosterley and [[Durham Cathedral]].\n\n==Course==\nRising in the east [[Pennines]], its head waters consisting of several streams draining from the hills between Killhope Law and [[Burnhope Seat]], the head of the river is held to be in [[Wearhead]], [[County Durham]] at the confluence of Burnhope Burn and Killhope Burn. This is shown on Ordnance Survey maps, and on the County Durham GIS online. However, a map produced by Durham County Council, and used on an interpretation board at Cowshill shows the River Wear taking in the northwest Killhope Burn from Wearhead up to Killhope. Excepting that this apparent extension of the Wear is an error, it can be assumed that there are attempts to reclassify Killhope Burn as the River Wear - on some analyses this practice of backtracking is common in the study of [[river]]s as it gives the River Wear an issue as the source instead of a [[confluence]], to which this article's [[River Wear#Geology and history|Geology]] relates. The River Wear is a spate river and has been heavily influenced by previous government funded drainage schemes (gripping) with a view to improving marginal agricultural land. The river rises very quickly and has experienced much heavy flooding resulting in enhanced river bank erosion\n\nThe river flows eastwards through [[Weardale]], one of the larger valleys of west [[County Durham]], subsequently turning south-east, and then north-east, meandering its way through the Wear Valley still in County Durham to the [[North Sea]] where it outfalls at Wearmouth in the main locality of [[Monkwearmouth]] on [[Wearside]] in the [[City of Sunderland]]. The {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} from head to mouth. Prior to the creation of [[Tyne and Wear]], the Wear had been the longest river in England with a course entirely within one county. The [[Weardale Way]], a long-distance public footpath, roughly follows the entire route, including the length of Killhope Burn.\n\n===Wearhead to Bishop Auckland===\n[[File:River Wear Weardale 20070617.jpg|thumb|The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows from [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] to [[Frosterley]]]]\n\nThere are several towns, sights and tourist places along the length of the river. The market town of [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] is known in part for the ford across the river. From here the river is followed by the line of the [[Weardale Railway]], which crosses the river several times, through [[Frosterley]], [[Wolsingham]], and [[Witton-le-Wear]] to [[Bishop Auckland]].\n\n===Bishop Auckland to Durham===\nOn the edge of [[Bishop Auckland]] the Wear passes below Auckland Park and [[Auckland Castle]], the official residence of the [[Bishop of Durham]] and its [[Medieval deer park|deer park]]. A mile or so downstream from here, the Wear passes [[Binchester Roman Fort]], [[Vinovia]], having been crossed by [[Dere Street]], the Roman road running from [[Eboracum]] (now [[York]]) to [[Coria (Corbridge)|Coria]] (now [[Corbridge]]) close to [[Hadrian's Wall]]. From Bishop Auckland the River Wear meanders in a general northeasterly direction, demonstrating many fluvial features of a mature river, including wide valley walls, fertile [[flood plain]]s and ox-bow lakes. Bridges over the river become more substantial, such as those at [[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]] (near [[Croxdale]]), and [[Shincliffe]]. At Sunderland Bridge the [[River Browney]] joins the River Wear.\n\n===Durham===\n[[File:River wear at durham.jpg|thumb|left|The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows through [[Durham, England|Durham]].]]\nWhen it reaches the city of [[Durham, England|Durham]] the River Wear passes through a deep, wooded gorge, from which several springs emerge, historically used as sources of [[potable water]]. A few coal seams are visible in the banks. Twisting sinuously in an incised [[meander]], the river has cut deeply into the \"Cathedral Sandstone\" bedrock. The high ground (bluffs) enclosed by this meander is known as the ''Peninsula'', forming a defensive enclosure, at whose heart lies [[Durham Castle]] and [[Durham Cathedral]] and which developed around [[the Bailey]] into Durham city. That area is now a UN [[World Heritage Site]].  Beneath [[Elvet Bridge]] are Brown's Boats (rowing boats for hire) and the mooring for the Prince Bishop, a pleasure cruiser.\n\nThe River Wear at Durham was featured on a television programme ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'' as one of the wonders of [[Northern England]].\n\nIn June each year, the [[Durham Regatta]], which predates that at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], attracts rowing crews from around the region for races along the river's course through the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Durham Regatta |url=http://www.durham-regatta.org.uk/|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> Seven smaller Regattas and Head Races are held throughout the rest of the year, which attract a lower number of competitors. There are 14 boathouses<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last       = Durham College Rowing\n |title      = Boat Clubs in Durham\n |accessdate = 2008-12-28\n |url        = http://www.dur.ac.uk/college.rowing/resources/rivers/river_wear.png\n|archive-url = https://archive.is/20120728162131/http://www.dur.ac.uk/college.rowing/resources/rivers/river_wear.png\n|url-status   = dead\n|archive-date = 2012-07-28\n}}\n</ref> and [[Rowing clubs on the River Wear#Durham|20 boat clubs]] based on the Wear in Durham.\n\nTwo weirs impede the flow of the river at Durham, both originally created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes a salmon leap and fish counter, monitoring [[sea trout]] and [[salmon]], and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} it may not be surprising that a family of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds).\n\nThe river's banks also lend their name to a [[hymn tune]] ''[[Elvet Banks]]'' in the 2006 hymnbook of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], used (appropriately) for a [[hymn]] for [[baptism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lutheran Music |url=http://www.lutheranmusic.com/library/LSB/pages/hymns/lsb407-midi.html|accessdate=2008-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n===Durham to Chester-le-Street===\n[[File:fichale.jpg|thumb|[[Finchale Priory]] on the banks of the River Wear between Durham City and Chester-le-Street. Note the wooden footbridge across the river on the right of the photograph.]]\nBetween Durham City and [[Chester-le-Street]], {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} due north, the River Wear changes direction repeatedly, flowing south westwards several miles downstream having passed the medieval site of [[Finchale Priory]], a former chapel and later a satellite monastery depending on the abbey church of [[Durham Cathedral]]. Two miles downstream, the river is flowing south eastwards. The only road bridge over the Wear between Durham and Chester-le-Street is Cocken Bridge. As it passes [[Chester-le-Street]], where the river is overlooked by [[Lumley Castle]], its flood plain has been developed into [[Riverside Ground|The Riverside]], the home pitch of [[Durham County Cricket Club]]. Passing through the Lambton Estate and near [[Lambton Castle]] the river becomes tidal, and navigable.\n\n===Chester-le-Street to Sunderland===\nOn exiting the Lambton estate the river leaves County Durham and enters the [[City of Sunderland]], specifically the southern/south-eastern edge of the new town of [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]]. At [[Fatfield]] the river passes beneath [[Lambton Worm|Worm Hill]], around which the [[Lambton Worm]] is reputed to have curled its tail.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lambton Worm |work=The Legends and Myths of Britain |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/legends/lampton_worm.html |accessdate=2007-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611223547/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/legends/lampton_worm.html |archive-date=2007-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlready the riverbanks are showing evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries and chemical works. A little further downstream the river passes beneath the Victoria Viaduct, (formally called the Victoria Bridge). Named after the newly crowned queen, the railway viaduct opened in 1838, was the crowning achievement of the [[Leamside Line]], then carrying what was to become the [[East Coast Main Line]].  A mile to the east is [[Penshaw Monument]], a local iconic landmark. As the river leaves the environs of Washington, it forms the eastern boundary of [[WWT Washington|Washington Wildfowl Trust]].\n\n===Sunderland===\n[[File:St peters campus.jpg|thumb|left|As the river approaches its outfall into the North Sea, it flows past [[St Peter's, Sunderland|St. Peter's Campus]], [[University of Sunderland]].<br />''Shadows in Another Light'', a sculpture in which the shadow cast by a tree represents a hammerhead crane, unique to the Sunderland shipyards,<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice in Sunderland |work=chazbrenchley.co.uk |url=http://www.chazbrenchley.co.uk/alice.html |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> can be seen at the left of this image.]]\n\nHaving flowed beneath the [[A19 road|A19 trunk road]], the river enters the suburbs of [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. The riverbanks show further evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries, engineering works and dozens of [[shipyard]]s. In their time, Wearside shipbuilders were some of the most famous and productive shipyards in the world. The artist [[L. S. Lowry]] visited Sunderland repeatedly and painted pictures of the industrial landscape around the river. Four bridges cross the Wear in Sunderland: the [[Northern Spire Bridge]] to the west, the [[Queen Alexandra Bridge]], and the Wearmouth rail and [[Wearmouth Bridge|road]] bridges in the city centre.\n\nOn both banks at this point there are modern developments, some belonging to the [[University of Sunderland]] ([[St Peter's, Sunderland|St. Peter's Campus]]; Scotia Quay residences) and to the [[National Glass Centre]]. A riverside [[sculpture trail]] runs alongside this final section of its north bank.<ref>{{cite web |title=St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project |work=chazbrenchley.co.uk |url=http://www.chazbrenchley.co.uk/sculpture.html |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> The St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project was created by Colin Wilbourn, with crime novelist and ex-poet [[Chaz Brenchley]]. They worked closely with community groups, residents and schools.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bryan |last=Talbot |authorlink=Bryan Talbot |title=[[Alice in Sunderland]]: An Entertainment |year=2007 |publisher=Jonathon Cape |location=London|isbn=0-224-08076-8 |pages=95\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nAs the river approaches the sea, the north bank (Roker) has a substantial residential development and marina.  A dolphin nicknamed Freddie was a frequent visitor to the marina, attracting much local publicity.  However, concern was expressed that acclimatising the dolphin to human presence might put at risk the safety of the dolphin regarding the propellors of marine craft.

At {{convert|60|mi|abbr=on}} long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the [[cathedral city]] of [[Durham, England|Durham]] and gives its name to [[Weardale]] in its upper reach and [[Wearside]] by its mouth.\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin behind the [[Hydronym|hydronym]] ''Wear'' is uncertain but is generally understood to be Celtic. The ''River Vedra'' on the Roman Map of Britain may very well be the River Wear. The name may be derived from [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*wejr'' (<''*w\u1eb9:dr\u0101''),<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> which meant \"a bend\" (c.f [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''-gwair-'').<ref name=\"BLITON\">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan G. |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence - Guide to the Elements |url=https://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary_2019_Edition.pdf |website=Scottish Place Name Society - The Brittonic Language in the Old North |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> An alternative but very problematic etymology might involve ''*w\u1eb9:d-r-'',<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> from a lengthened form of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *wed- \"water\".<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> Also suggested is a possible derivation from the Brittonic root ''*wei-'', which is thought to have meant \"to flow\".<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> The name ''Wear'' has also been explained as being an ancient Celtic name meaning \"river of blood\".<ref>{{cite web|title=North East Place Name Meanings T to Y - England's North East|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/PlaceNameMeaningsTtoY.html|website=www.englandsnortheast.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the ''Wear'' has the same etymology as the [[River Wyre]] in [[Lancashire]],<ref name=\"BLITON\" /> as well as the [[Quair Water]] in Scotland.<ref name=\"BLITON\" />\n\n==Geology==\nThe Wear rises in the east Pennines, an upland area raised up during the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. Specifically, the Weardale Granite underlies the headwaters of the Wear. Devonian [[Old Red Sandstone]] in age, this Weardale Granite does not outcrop{{#tag:ref| i.e. appear on the surface|group= n}} but was surmised by early geologists, and subsequently proven to exist as seen in the Rookhope borehole.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geology: Granite in the North Pennines |url=http://www.pastperfect.org.uk/sites/oldrookhope/archive/40.html|accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> It is the presence of this granite that has retained the high upland elevations of this area (less through its relative hardness, and more due to isostatic equilibrium) and accounts for heavy local mineralisation, although it is considered that most of the mineralisation occurred during the Carboniferous period.\n\nIt is thought that the course of the River Wear, prior to the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], was much as it is now as far as [[Chester-le-Street]]. This can be established as a result of boreholes, of which there have been many in the Wear valley due to [[coal mining]]. However, northwards from Chester-le-Street, the Wear may have originally followed the current route of the lower [[River Team]]. The last glaciation reached its peak about 18,500 years ago, from which time it also began a progressive retreat, leaving a wide variety of glacial deposits in its wake, filling existing river valleys with silt, sand and other [[Till|glacial till]]. At about 14,000 years ago, retreat of the ice paused for maybe 500 years at the city of [[Durham, England|Durham]]. This can be established by the types of glacial deposits in the vicinity of Durham City. The confluence of the [[River Browney]] was pushed from [[Gilesgate]] (the abandoned river valley still exists in Pelaw Woods), several miles south to [[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]] ([[Croxdale]]). At Chester-le-Street, when glacial [[boulder clay]] was deposited blocking its northerly course, the River Wear was diverted eastwards towards [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] where it was forced to cut a new, shallower valley. The gorge cut by the river through the [[Permian]] [[Magnesian Limestone]] can be seen most clearly at Ford Quarry. In the 17th edition of [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] (1990), reference is made to a pre-Ice Age course of the River Wear outfalling at [[Hartlepool]].\n\nThe upland area of Upper Weardale retains a flora that relates, almost uniquely in [[England]], to the end of the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], although it almost or entirely lacks the particular rarities that make up the unique \"Teesdale Assemblage\" of post-glacial plants. This may, in part, be due to the [[Pennines|Pennine]] areas of Upper Weardale and Upper Teesdale being the site of the shrinking [[ice cap]]. The glaciation left behind many indications of its presence, including lateral [[moraines]] and material from the [[Lake District]] and [[Northumberland]], although surprisingly few [[drumlins]]. After the Ice Age, the Wear valley became thickly forested, however during the [[Neolithic]] period and increasingly in the [[Bronze Age]], were largely [[deforestation|deforested]] for agriculture.\n\n==Industrial history==\nMuch of the River Wear is associated with the history of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Its upper end runs through lead mining country, until this gives way to coal seams of the Durham coalfield for the rest of its length. As a result of limestone quarrying, lead mining and coal mining, the Wear valley was amongst the first places to see the development of railways. The [[Weardale Railway]] continues to run occasional services between [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] and [[Wolsingham]].\n\nMining of [[lead ore]] has been known in the area of the headwaters of the Wear since the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]] and continued into the nineteenth century. Spoil heaps from the abandoned lead mines can still be seen,{{where?|date=December 2012}} and since the last quarter of the twentieth century have been the focus of attention for the recovery of [[gangue]] minerals in present mining, such as fluorspar for the smelting of [[aluminium]].  However, abandoned mines and their spoil heaps continue to contribute to heavy metal mineral pollution of the river and its tributaries. This has significance to fishing in times of low flow and infrastructure costs as the River Wear is an important source of drinking water for many of the inhabitants along its course.\n\n[[Fluorspar]] is another mineral sporadically co-present with Weardale Granite and became important in the manufacture of steel from the late 19th century into the 20th century. In many cases the steel industries were able to take fluorspar from old excavation heaps.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Fluorspar explains why iron and steel manufacture flourished in the [[Wear Valley|Wear valley]], [[Consett]] and Teesside during the nineteenth century.  Overlying are three [[Carboniferous]] minerals: [[Carboniferous limestone|limestone]], [[Coal measure|Coal Measures]] as raw materials for iron and steel manufacture, and [[sandstone]], useful as a [[refractory material]]. The last remaining flourspar mine closed in 1999 following legislation re water quality. A mine at [[Rogerley Quarry]], Frosterley, is operated by an American consortium who occasionally work it for specimen minerals.\n\nMinco are currently exploring the North Pennines and the upper Wear catchment for potential reserves of [[zinc]] at lower levels.\n\n[[Ironstone]] which was important as the ore was won from around [[Consett]] and [[Tow Law]], then around [[Rookhope]], while greater quantities were imported from just south of the southerly [[Tees]] in [[North Yorkshire]]. These sources were in due course depleted or became uneconomic.\n\nThe former [[cement]] works at [[Eastgate, County Durham|Eastgate]], until recently run by [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]], was based on an inlier of limestone. The site recently gained planning permission to form a visitor complex showcasing an eco-village using alternative technology, including a \"hot rocks\" water heating system. The underlying granite has been drilled and reports confirm their presence. Bardon Aggregates continue to quarry at Heights near [[Westgate, County Durham|Westgate]] and operate a tarmac \"blacktop\" plant on site.\n\nMineral extraction has also occurred above [[St John's Chapel, County Durham|St John's Chapel]] with the extraction of [[ganister]] which was used in the steel process at Consett. Around [[Frosterley]], limestone, sand (crushed sandstone) and Frosterley Marble have been worked and the Broadwood Quarry recently expanded into ground held on an old licence. The crushing plant continues to operate. A quarry at Bollihope was also mooted on a similar basis but plans seem to have been discontinued. Frosterley Marble was used extensively in church architecture, there are local examples in St Michael's church Frosterley and [[Durham Cathedral]].\n\n==Course==\nRising in the east [[Pennines]], its head waters consisting of several streams draining from the hills between Killhope Law and [[Burnhope Seat]], the head of the river is held to be in [[Wearhead]], [[County Durham]] at the confluence of Burnhope Burn and Killhope Burn. This is shown on Ordnance Survey maps, and on the County Durham GIS online. However, a map produced by Durham County Council, and used on an interpretation board at Cowshill shows the River Wear taking in the northwest Killhope Burn from Wearhead up to Killhope. Excepting that this apparent extension of the Wear is an error, it can be assumed that there are attempts to reclassify Killhope Burn as the River Wear - on some analyses this practice of backtracking is common in the study of [[river]]s as it gives the River Wear an issue as the source instead of a [[confluence]], to which this article's [[River Wear#Geology and history|Geology]] relates. The River Wear is a spate river and has been heavily influenced by previous government funded drainage schemes (gripping) with a view to improving marginal agricultural land. The river rises very quickly and has experienced much heavy flooding resulting in enhanced river bank erosion\n\nThe river flows eastwards through [[Weardale]], one of the larger valleys of west [[County Durham]], subsequently turning south-east, and then north-east, meandering its way through the Wear Valley still in County Durham to the [[North Sea]] where it outfalls at Wearmouth in the main locality of [[Monkwearmouth]] on [[Wearside]] in the [[City of Sunderland]]. The {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} from head to mouth. Prior to the creation of [[Tyne and Wear]], the Wear had been the longest river in England with a course entirely within one county. The [[Weardale Way]], a long-distance public footpath, roughly follows the entire route, including the length of Killhope Burn.\n\n===Wearhead to Bishop Auckland===\n[[File:River Wear Weardale 20070617.jpg|thumb|The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows from [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] to [[Frosterley]]]]\n\nThere are several towns, sights and tourist places along the length of the river. The market town of [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] is known in part for the ford across the river. From here the river is followed by the line of the [[Weardale Railway]], which crosses the river several times, through [[Frosterley]], [[Wolsingham]], and [[Witton-le-Wear]] to [[Bishop Auckland]].\n\n===Bishop Auckland to Durham===\nOn the edge of [[Bishop Auckland]] the Wear passes below Auckland Park and [[Auckland Castle]], the official residence of the [[Bishop of Durham]] and its [[Medieval deer park|deer park]]. A mile or so downstream from here, the Wear passes [[Binchester Roman Fort]], [[Vinovia]], having been crossed by [[Dere Street]], the Roman road running from [[Eboracum]] (now [[York]]) to [[Coria (Corbridge)|Coria]] (now [[Corbridge]]) close to [[Hadrian's Wall]]. From Bishop Auckland the River Wear meanders in a general northeasterly direction, demonstrating many fluvial features of a mature river, including wide valley walls, fertile [[flood plain]]s and ox-bow lakes. Bridges over the river become more substantial, such as those at [[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]] (near [[Croxdale]]), and [[Shincliffe]]. At Sunderland Bridge the [[River Browney]] joins the River Wear.\n\n===Durham===\n[[File:River wear at durham.jpg|thumb|left|The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows through [[Durham, England|Durham]].]]\nWhen it reaches the city of [[Durham, England|Durham]] the River Wear passes through a deep, wooded gorge, from which several springs emerge, historically used as sources of [[potable water]]. A few coal seams are visible in the banks. Twisting sinuously in an incised [[meander]], the river has cut deeply into the \"Cathedral Sandstone\" bedrock. The high ground (bluffs) enclosed by this meander is known as the ''Peninsula'', forming a defensive enclosure, at whose heart lies [[Durham Castle]] and [[Durham Cathedral]] and which developed around [[the Bailey]] into Durham city. That area is now a UN [[World Heritage Site]].  Beneath [[Elvet Bridge]] are Brown's Boats (rowing boats for hire) and the mooring for the Prince Bishop, a pleasure cruiser.\n\nThe River Wear at Durham was featured on a television programme ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'' as one of the wonders of [[Northern England]].\n\nIn June each year, the [[Durham Regatta]], which predates that at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], attracts rowing crews from around the region for races along the river's course through the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Durham Regatta |url=http://www.durham-regatta.org.uk/|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> Seven smaller Regattas and Head Races are held throughout the rest of the year, which attract a lower number of competitors. There are 14 boathouses<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last       = Durham College Rowing\n |title      = Boat Clubs in Durham\n |accessdate = 2008-12-28\n |url        = http://www.dur.ac.uk/college.rowing/resources/rivers/river_wear.png\n|archive-url = https://archive.is/20120728162131/http://www.dur.ac.uk/college.rowing/resources/rivers/river_wear.png\n|url-status   = dead\n|archive-date = 2012-07-28\n}}\n</ref> and [[Rowing clubs on the River Wear#Durham|20 boat clubs]] based on the Wear in Durham.\n\nTwo weirs impede the flow of the river at Durham, both originally created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes a salmon leap and fish counter, monitoring [[sea trout]] and [[salmon]], and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} it may not be surprising that a family of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds).\n\nThe river's banks also lend their name to a [[hymn tune]] ''[[Elvet Banks]]'' in the 2006 hymnbook of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], used (appropriately) for a [[hymn]] for [[baptism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lutheran Music |url=http://www.lutheranmusic.com/library/LSB/pages/hymns/lsb407-midi.html|accessdate=2008-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n===Durham to Chester-le-Street===\n[[File:fichale.jpg|thumb|[[Finchale Priory]] on the banks of the River Wear between Durham City and Chester-le-Street. Note the wooden footbridge across the river on the right of the photograph.]]\nBetween Durham City and [[Chester-le-Street]], {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} due north, the River Wear changes direction repeatedly, flowing south westwards several miles downstream having passed the medieval site of [[Finchale Priory]], a former chapel and later a satellite monastery depending on the abbey church of [[Durham Cathedral]]. Two miles downstream, the river is flowing south eastwards. The only road bridge over the Wear between Durham and Chester-le-Street is Cocken Bridge. As it passes [[Chester-le-Street]], where the river is overlooked by [[Lumley Castle]], its flood plain has been developed into [[Riverside Ground|The Riverside]], the home pitch of [[Durham County Cricket Club]]. Passing through the Lambton Estate and near [[Lambton Castle]] the river becomes tidal, and navigable.\n\n===Chester-le-Street to Sunderland===\nOn exiting the Lambton estate the river leaves County Durham and enters the [[City of Sunderland]], specifically the southern/south-eastern edge of the new town of [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]]. At [[Fatfield]] the river passes beneath [[Lambton Worm|Worm Hill]], around which the [[Lambton Worm]] is reputed to have curled its tail.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lambton Worm |work=The Legends and Myths of Britain |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/legends/lampton_worm.html |accessdate=2007-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611223547/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/legends/lampton_worm.html |archive-date=2007-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlready the riverbanks are showing evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries and chemical works. A little further downstream the river passes beneath the Victoria Viaduct, (formally called the Victoria Bridge). Named after the newly crowned queen, the railway viaduct opened in 1838, was the crowning achievement of the [[Leamside Line]], then carrying what was to become the [[East Coast Main Line]].  A mile to the east is [[Penshaw Monument]], a local iconic landmark. As the river leaves the environs of Washington, it forms the eastern boundary of [[WWT Washington|Washington Wildfowl Trust]].\n\n===Sunderland===\n[[File:St peters campus.jpg|thumb|left|As the river approaches its outfall into the North Sea, it flows past [[St Peter's, Sunderland|St. Peter's Campus]], [[University of Sunderland]].<br />''Shadows in Another Light'', a sculpture in which the shadow cast by a tree represents a hammerhead crane, unique to the Sunderland shipyards,<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice in Sunderland |work=chazbrenchley.co.uk |url=http://www.chazbrenchley.co.uk/alice.html |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> can be seen at the left of this image.]]\n\nHaving flowed beneath the [[A19 road|A19 trunk road]], the river enters the suburbs of [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]]. The riverbanks show further evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries, engineering works and dozens of [[shipyard]]s. In their time, Wearside shipbuilders were some of the most famous and productive shipyards in the world. The artist [[L. S. Lowry]] visited Sunderland repeatedly and painted pictures of the industrial landscape around the river. Four bridges cross the Wear in Sunderland: the [[Northern Spire Bridge]] to the west, the [[Queen Alexandra Bridge]], and the Wearmouth rail and [[Wearmouth Bridge|road]] bridges in the city centre.\n\nOn both banks at this point there are modern developments, some belonging to the [[University of Sunderland]] ([[St Peter's, Sunderland|St. Peter's Campus]]; Scotia Quay residences) and to the [[National Glass Centre]]. A riverside [[sculpture trail]] runs alongside this final section of its north bank.<ref>{{cite web |title=St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project |work=chazbrenchley.co.uk |url=http://www.chazbrenchley.co.uk/sculpture.html |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> The St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project was created by Colin Wilbourn, with crime novelist and ex-poet [[Chaz Brenchley]].

A dolphin nicknamed Freddie was a frequent visitor to the marina, attracting much local publicity.  However, concern was expressed that acclimatising the dolphin to human presence might put at risk the safety of the dolphin regarding the propellors of marine craft. The south bank of the river is occupied by what remains of the Port of Sunderland, once thriving and now almost gone.\n\nThe River Wear flows out of Sunderland between [[Roker]] Pier and South Pier, and into the [[North Sea]].\n{{clearleft}}\n== See also ==\n* [[List of crossings of the River Wear]]\n* [[List of rivers of England]]\n* [[Rowing clubs on the River Wear]]\n* [[Harry Watts]] \u2013 multiple River Wear life-saver\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:River Wear Sunderland Bridge railway viaduct 20070630.jpg|[[Croxdale Viaduct]] carrying the [[East Coast Main Line]]\nImage:River Wear Sunderland Bridge 20070630.jpg|[[Sunderland Bridge, County Durham|Sunderland Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear Sunderland Bridge (2) 20070630.JPG|Sunderland Bridge\nImage:River Wear Shincliffe Bridge 20070630.JPG|The 1826 stone bridge at [[Shincliffe]]\nImage:River Wear Maiden Castle Bridge 20070630.JPG|Maiden Castle footbridge\nImage:River Wear Baths Bridge 20070630.JPG|Baths Bridge \nImage:River Wear New Elvet Bridge 20070630.JPG|[[New Elvet Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear Elvet Bridge (1) 20070630.JPG|[[Elvet Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear Durham Kingsgate Bridge 20070630.jpg|looking towards [[Kingsgate Bridge]]\nImage:Dunelm-view.jpg|Kingsgate Bridge\nImage:River Wear Durham Prebends Bridge (1) 20011229.jpg|[[Prebends Bridge]]\nImage:Durham City 30c 20031207 Prebends Bridge 02a.jpg|Prebends Bridge\nImage:Durham City 35c 20030907 River Wear 01 upstream.jpg|[[Milburngate Bridge]] (foreground) and [[Framwellgate Bridge]] (background)\nImage:Durham City 20030907 Pennyfeather Bridge 03 (originals).JPG|[[Pennyferry Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear 20070701 Cocken Bridge 01.jpg|[[Cocken Bridge]]\nImage:River Wear 20070702 Washington Fatfield Bridge 01.jpg|[[Fatfield]] Bridge\nImage:River Wear 20070702 Washington Victoria Viaduct 01.jpg|[[Victoria Viaduct]]\nImage:River Wear 20070702 Hylton Viaduct 01.jpg|[[Hylton Viaduct]]\nImage:Wearmouth bridge.jpg|[[Wearmouth Bridge]]\nImage:Roker Lighthouse - geograph.org.uk - 1095762.jpg|[[Roker]] Pier lighthouse, where the river meets the sea\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes \n{{Reflist|group=n}}  \n;References\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*[[Natural Environment Research Council]], Institute of Geological Sciences, 1971, \"British Regional Geology: Northern England\" Fourth Edition, HMSO, London.\n*Johnson, G.A.L. & Hickling, G.
