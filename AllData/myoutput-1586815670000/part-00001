While performing at Sun Splash \u201993, he befriended Ninjaman and the two began collaborating. As Snow put it, \"we just clicked, so now we always hang out. Everyday when I'm in [[Jamaica]] I hang with him. When he's doing a track, he'll always invite me to come on it with him.\" In addition to working with Ninjaman, Snow began recording with one of the artists that influenced his interest in reggae, Junior Reid, who went on to produce the track that also featured Snow and Ninjaman, \"Si We Dem Nuh Know We.\"<ref name=\"See Patricia Meschino 1995\"/> Junior Reid also performed as guest vocalist on \"Yesterday.\" Ninjaman also appeared as a guest vocalist on \"Bad Men.\" Nadine Sutherland performed on the first single, \"Anything For You\", and Half-Pint performs on \"Rivertown\" and joins White Mice on \"Time.\" The album featured several producers, including Junior Reid (\"Si We Dem Nuh Know We\"), Onree Gill (\"Bad Men,\" \"Rivertown,\" \"Babylon,\" \"Time,\" \"Dream,\" \"If You Like the Sound,\" and \"Let\u2019s Get it on\"), [[MC Shan]] (\"Yesterday\" and \"Sexy Girl\") and Herby Azor ([[Anything for You (Snow song)|\"Anything for You\"]] and \"Things to Say\").<ref>For credits,see: {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=snow-p26072/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, Snow spent eight months in Jamaica recording the album, and his recording crew, including [[M.C.

When I'm working, I don't listen to other music, for fear of stealing something unconsciously. But down there, you can't get away from music, it's all around you.\" He also observed, \"The forward thing in dancehall reggae now is being positive, not singing all the time about gun talk and women.
