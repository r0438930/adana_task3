The functional principle of a microwave oven is [[dielectric heating]] rather than resonance frequencies of water, and microwave ovens can therefore operate at many frequencies. Water molecules are exposed to intense electromagnetic fields in strong non-resonant microwaves to create heat. The 22&nbsp;GHz resonant frequency of isolated water molecules has a wavelength too short to penetrate common foodstuffs to useful depths. The typical oven frequency of [[ISM band|2.45&nbsp;GHz]] was chosen partly due to its ability to penetrate a food object of reasonable size, and partly to avoid interference with communication frequencies in use when microwave ovens became commercially available.<ref name=\"microwave\">{{cite web |author=Bloomfield, Louis |url=http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 |title=Question 1456 |publisher=How Everything Works |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017005928/http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n* [[Microwave oven]]s do not cook food from the inside out. 2.45&nbsp;GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately {{convert|1|cm|sp=us}} into most foods.

The original Hebrew texts mention only ''tree'' and ''fruit''. Early Latin translations use the word ''mali'', which can mean either \"evil\" or \"apple\" depending on if the A is short or long respectively, although the difference in [[vowel length]] had already vanished from speech in Latin at the time. In early Germanic languages the word \"apple\" and its cognates usually meant simply \"fruit\".

However most people do not realize that the paper would NOT rise if it was flat, even though you are blowing air across the top of it at a furious rate. Bernoulli's principle does not apply directly in this case. This is because the air on the two sides of the paper did not start out from the same source. The air on the bottom is ambient air from the room, but the air on the top came from your mouth where you actually increased its speed without decreasing its pressure by forcing it out of your mouth. As a result the air on both sides of the flat paper actually has the same pressure, even though the air on the top is moving faster. The reason that a curved piece of paper does rise is that the air from your mouth speeds up even more as it follows the curve of the paper, which in turn lowers the pressure according to Bernoulli.\" From The Aeronautics File By Max Feil\n</ref>\n* The [[Coriolis effect]] does not cause water to consistently drain from basins in a clockwise/counter-clockwise direction depending on the hemisphere.

The Coriolis force can impact the direction of the flow of water but only in rare circumstances. The water has to be so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container and the externally applied [[torque]]s (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) have to be very small.\n* [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Gyroscopic effects|Gyroscopic forces]] or [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Trail|geometric trail]] are not required for a rider to [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Other hypotheses|balance]] a bicycle or for it to demonstrate [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Self-stability|self-stability]].<ref name=\"KMPRS\">{{cite journal\n| journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | author = J.

The functional principle of a microwave oven is [[dielectric heating]] rather than resonance frequencies of water, and microwave ovens can therefore operate at many frequencies. Water molecules are exposed to intense electromagnetic fields in strong non-resonant microwaves to create heat. The 22&nbsp;GHz resonant frequency of isolated water molecules has a wavelength too short to penetrate common foodstuffs to useful depths. The typical oven frequency of [[ISM band|2.45&nbsp;GHz]] was chosen partly due to its ability to penetrate a food object of reasonable size, and partly to avoid interference with communication frequencies in use when microwave ovens became commercially available.<ref name=\"microwave\">{{cite web |author=Bloomfield, Louis |url=http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 |title=Question 1456 |publisher=How Everything Works |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017005928/http://www.howeverythingworks.org/page1.php?QNum=1456 |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n* [[Microwave oven]]s do not cook food from the inside out. 2.45&nbsp;GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately {{convert|1|cm|sp=us}} into most foods.

While it is true that a curved paper lifts when flow is applied on one side, this is not because air is moving at different speeds on the two sides... ''It is false to make a connection between the flow on the two sides of the paper using Bernoulli's equation.''\" Holger Babinsky How Do Wings Work\" Physics Education 38(6) http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/38/6/001/pdf/pe3_6_001.pdf\n* \"An explanation based on Bernoulli's principle is not applicable to this situation, because this principle has nothing to say about the interaction of air masses having different speeds... Also, while Bernoulli's principle allows us to compare fluid speeds and pressures along a single streamline and... along two different streamlines that originate under identical fluid conditions, using Bernoulli's principle to compare the air above and below the curved paper in Figure 1 is nonsensical; in this case, there aren't any streamlines at all below the paper!\" Peter Eastwell ''Bernoulli?

The upper edge is a complicated vortex-laden mixing layer and the distant flow is quiescent, so that Bernoulli's law is hardly applicable.\" David Auerbach ''Why Aircreft Fly'' European Journal of Physics Vol 21 p 289 http://iopscience.iop.org/0143-0807/21/4/302/pdf/0143-0807_21_4_302.pdf\n* \"Millions of children in science classes are being asked to blow over curved pieces of paper and observe that the paper \"lifts\"...

Hold a piece of paper so that it curves over your finger, then blow across the top. The paper will rise. However most people do not realize that the paper would NOT rise if it was flat, even though you are blowing air across the top of it at a furious rate. Bernoulli's principle does not apply directly in this case. This is because the air on the two sides of the paper did not start out from the same source. The air on the bottom is ambient air from the room, but the air on the top came from your mouth where you actually increased its speed without decreasing its pressure by forcing it out of your mouth. As a result the air on both sides of the flat paper actually has the same pressure, even though the air on the top is moving faster. The reason that a curved piece of paper does rise is that the air from your mouth speeds up even more as it follows the curve of the paper, which in turn lowers the pressure according to Bernoulli.\" From The Aeronautics File By Max Feil\n</ref>\n* The [[Coriolis effect]] does not cause water to consistently drain from basins in a clockwise/counter-clockwise direction depending on the hemisphere. The common myth often refers to the draining action of [[flush toilets]] and [[bathtubs]]. Rotation is determined by whatever minor rotation is initially present at the time the water starts to drain. The Coriolis force can impact the direction of the flow of water but only in rare circumstances. The water has to be so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container and the externally applied [[torque]]s (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) have to be very small.\n* [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Gyroscopic effects|Gyroscopic forces]] or [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Trail|geometric trail]] are not required for a rider to [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Other hypotheses|balance]] a bicycle or for it to demonstrate [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Self-stability|self-stability]].<ref name=\"KMPRS\">{{cite journal\n| journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | author = J.
