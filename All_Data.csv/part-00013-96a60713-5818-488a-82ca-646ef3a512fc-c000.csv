'''''Mariner 10''''' was an American [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[space probe]] launched by [[NASA]] on 3 November 1973, to fly by the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]. It was the first spacecraft to perform flybys of multiple planets.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404|isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' was launched approximately two years after ''[[Mariner 9]]'' and was the last spacecraft in the [[Mariner program]]. (Mariner 11 and 12 were allocated to the [[Voyager program]] and redesignated ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]''.)

The mission objectives were to measure Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the [[interplanetary medium]] and to obtain experience with a dual-planet [[gravity assist]] mission. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s science team was led by [[Bruce C. Murray]] at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].<ref name=Schudel>{{cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Bruce C.

''Mariner 10'' was the first spacecraft to make use of an interplanetary [[gravitational slingshot]] maneuver, using Venus to bend its flight path and bring its [[perihelion]] down to the level of Mercury's orbit.<ref name=\"Mission Overview\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=2 February 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140219012506/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|archive-date=19 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404 |isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> This maneuver, inspired by the [[orbital mechanics]] calculations of the Italian scientist [[Giuseppe Colombo]], put the spacecraft into an orbit that repeatedly brought it back to Mercury. ''Mariner 10'' used the solar [[radiation pressure]] on its [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and its high-gain antenna as a means of [[attitude control]] during flight, the first spacecraft to use active solar pressure control.

The components on ''Mariner 10'' can be categorized into four groups based on their common function. The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub, which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism. The hub stored the spacecraft's internal electronics.<ref name=\"NSSDC\"/><ref>Clark 2007, pp. 22-23 </ref><ref name=\"Strom16\"/> The Mariner 10 spacecraft was manufactured by Boeing.<ref name=\"Mariner 10 Quicklook\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10 Quicklook |url=http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/mariner10QL.html&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> NASA set a strict limit of US$98 million for Mariner 10's total cost, which marked the first time the agency subjected a mission to an inflexible budget constraint. No overruns would be tolerated, so mission planners carefully considered cost efficiency when designing the spacecraft's instruments.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 222</ref> Cost control was primarily accomplished by executing contract work closer to the launch date than was recommended by normal mission schedules, as reducing the length of available work time increased cost efficiency. Despite the rushed schedule, very few deadlines were missed.<ref name=\"Biggs\"/> The mission ended up about US$1 million under budget.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 142</ref>

The flyby past Mercury posed major technical challenges for scientists to overcome. Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32–33</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 °C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76°.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30–32</ref>

Accurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25–26</ref>

The mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)

== Instruments ==
[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]

''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury. Six of these experiments had a dedicated scientific instrument to collect data.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p.19</ref> The experiments and instruments were designed by research laboratories and educational institutions from across the United States.<ref>Giberson and Cunningham 1975, p. 719</ref> Out of forty-six submissions, JPL selected seven experiments on the basis of maximizing science return without exceeding cost guidelines: together, the seven scientific experiments cost US12.6 million dollars, about one-eighth of the total mission budget.<ref name=\"Biggs\">{{Citation|last=Biggs|first=John R.|author-link=|last2=Downhower|first2=Walter J.|author2-link=|title=Mariner Venus/Mercury '73: A Strategy of Cost Control|journal=Astronautics & Aeronautics|volume=12|issue=5|pages=48–53|publisher=The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=New York|date=June 1974|language=|url=|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Television photography===
The imaging system, the Television Photography Experiment, consisted of two {{convert|15|cm}} [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] telescopes feeding [[vidicon]] tubes.<ref name=nssdccam>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-01 NASA/NSSDC – Mariner 10 – Television Photography]</ref> The main telescope could be bypassed to a smaller wide angle optic, but using the same tube.<ref name=nssdccam/> It had an 8-position filter wheel, with one position occupied by a mirror for the wide-angle bypass.<ref name=nssdccam/>

The entire imaging system was imperiled when electric heaters attached to the cameras failed to turn on immediately after launch. To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 °C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43–48</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on. This allowed the vidicons to be turned off as needed.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 57–58</ref>

Of the six main scientific instruments, the {{convert|43.6|kg}} cameras were by far the most massive device. Requiring 67 watts of electricity, the cameras consumed more power than the other five instruments combined.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> The system returned about 7000 photographs of Mercury and Venus during Mariner 10's flybys.<ref name=nssdccam/>

===Infrared radiometer===
The infrared [[radiometer]] detected [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] given off by the surface of Mercury and the atmosphere of Venus, from which the temperature could be calculated. How quickly the surface lost heat as it rotated into the planet's dark side revealed aspects about the composition of the surface, such as whether it was made out of rocks, or out of finer particles.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 21-22</ref><ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> The infrared radiometer contained a pair of Cassegrain telescopes fixed at an angle of 120° to each other and a pair of detectors made from antimony-bismuth [[thermopile]]s. The instrument was designed to measure temperatures as cold as -193 °C and as hot as 427 °C. Stillman C. Chase, Jr. of the Santa Barbara Research Center headed the infrared radiometer experiment.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\">{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Science Instrument Survey|publisher=Ames Research Center, NASA|series=|volume=|edition=|date=May 1973 |location=Moffett Field|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143/page/n153 148]–167|language=|url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143|doi=|id=|isbn=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Ultraviolet spectrometers===
Two ultraviolet [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] were involved in this experiment, one to measure UV absorption, the other to sense UV emissions. The occultation spectrometer scanned Mercury's edge as it passed in front of the Sun, and detected whether solar ultraviolet radiation was absorbed in certain wavelengths, which would indicate the presence of gas particles, and therefore an atmosphere.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 25-26</ref> The [[airglow]] spectrometer detected extreme ultraviolet radiation emanating from atoms of gaseous hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and argon.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/><ref>Rothery 2015, p. 26</ref> Unlike the occultation spectrometer, it did not require backlighting from the Sun and could move along with the rotatable scan platform on the spacecraft. The experiment's most important goal was to ascertain whether Mercury had an atmosphere, but would also gather data at Earth and Venus and study the interstellar background radiation.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 18-19</ref>

===Plasma detectors===
The plasma experiment's goal was to study the ionized gases ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) of the solar wind, the temperature and density of its electrons, and how the planets affected the velocity of the plasma stream.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer and Electron Spectrometer|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|work=National Space Science Data Center|date=|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-03|format=|doi=|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> The experiment contained two components, facing in opposite directions. The Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer was aimed toward the Sun and could detect positive ions and electrons, which were separated by a set of three concentric hemispherical plates. The Scanning Electron Spectrometer has aimed away from the Sun, and detected only electrons, using just one hemispherical plate. The instruments could be rotated about 60° to either side.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> By gathering data on the solar wind's movement around Mercury, the plasma experiment could be used to verify the magnetometer's observations of Mercury's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> Using the plasma detectors, Mariner 10 gathered the first ''in situ'' solar wind data from inside Venus' orbit.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 22-23</ref>

Shortly after launch, scientists found that the Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer had failed because a door shielding the analyzer did not open. An unsuccessful attempt was made to forcibly unfasten the door with the first course correction maneuver.<ref name=\"No. 7\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 7: First Trajectory Correction Maneuver A Success|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=13 November 1973|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-07.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> The experiment operators had planned to observe the directions taken by positive ions prior to the ions' collision with the Analyzer, but this data was lost.<ref name=\"No. 15\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 15: Venus Flyby Set For Tuesday at 10:01 A.M.

===Charged particle telescopes===
The goal of the charged particles experiment was to observe how the [[heliosphere]] interacted with [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]].<ref name=\"Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 19 </ref> In connection with the plasma detectors and magnetometers, this experiment had the potential to provide additional evidence of a magnetic field around Mercury,<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 28</ref> by showing whether such a field had captured charged particles.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> Two telescopes were used to collect highly energetic electrons and atomic nuclei, specifically oxygen nuclei or less massive.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\">Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24</ref> These particles then passed through a set of detectors and were counted.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/>

===Magnetometers===
Two fluxgate magnetometers were entrusted with discerning whether Mercury produced a [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]],<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 27</ref> and studying the interplanetary magnetic field between flybys.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\"/> In designing this experiment, scientists had to account for interference from the magnetic field generated by Mariner 10's many electronic parts. For this reason, the magnetometers had to be situated on a long boom, one closer to the octagonal hub, the other one further away. Data from the two magnetometers would be cross-referenced to filter out the spacecraft's own magnetic field.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 95</ref> Drastically weakening the probe's magnetic field would have increased costs.<ref name=\"Shirley\"/>

===Celestial Mechanics and Radio Science experiment===
This experiment investigated the mass and gravitational characteristics of Mercury. It was of particular interest because of the planet's closeness to the Sun, large orbital eccentricity, and unusual spin-orbit resonance.<ref name=NASAHistory/>

As the spacecraft passed behind Mercury on the first encounter there was an opportunity to probe the atmosphere and to measure the radius of the planet. By observing phase changes in the S-band radio signal, measurements of the atmosphere could be made. The atmosphere was assessed as having a density of about {{val| |e=16|u=molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref name=NASAHistory>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/ mariner.htm History article on Mariner 10 at history.nasa.gov]</ref>

== Departing the Earth–Moon system ==
[[File:Earth & Moon by Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|left|''Mariner 10'' imaged the Earth and Moon shortly after launch.]]

Boeing finished building the spacecraft at the end of June 1973, and ''Mariner 10'' was delivered from Seattle to JPL's headquarters in California, where JPL comprehensively tested the integrity of the spacecraft and its instruments. After the tests were finished, the probe was transported to the [[Eastern Test Range]] in Florida, the launch site.

On 3 November at 17:45 UTC, the Atlas-Centaur carrying ''Mariner 10'' lifted off from pad [[Spaceport Florida Launch Complex 36|SLC-36B]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/displayTrajectory.action?id=1973-085A|title=Mariner 10 Launch and Trajectory Information|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> The Atlas stage burned for around four minutes, after which it was jettisoned, and the Centaur stage took over for an additional five minutes, propelling ''Mariner 10'' to a [[parking orbit]]. The temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around Earth: this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the Centaur engines, which set ''Mariner 10'' on a path towards Venus. The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision. Never before had a planetary mission depended upon two separate rocket burns during the launch, and even with ''Mariner 10'', scientists initially viewed the maneuver as too risky.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowles|first=Mark D.|authorlink=

During its first week of flight, the ''Mariner 10'' camera system was tested by taking five [[Panoramic photography|photographic mosaics]] of the [[Earth]] and six of the [[Moon]]. It also obtained photographs of the north polar region of the Moon where prior coverage was poor. These photographs provided a basis for cartographers to update lunar maps and improve the [[Selenographic coordinates|lunar control net]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 47–53.</ref>

== Cruise to Venus ==
[[File:Mariner-10-Trajectory-first half.PNG|thumb|left|The trajectory of ''Mariner 10'' spacecraft: since launch on 3 November 1973, to first fly-by of Mercury on 29 March 1974.]]

Far from being an uneventful cruise, ''Mariner 10''{{’}}s three-month journey to Venus was fraught with technical malfunctions, which kept mission control on edge.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 55</ref> [[Donna Shirley]] recounted her team's frustration: \"It seemed as if we were always just patching Mariner 10 together long enough to get it on to the next phase and next crisis\".<ref>Shirley 1998, p. 91 </ref> A trajectory correction maneuver was made on 13 November 1973. Immediately afterward, the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star [[Canopus]]. An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator. Mission planners feared that the same problem could recur in the redundant system and cripple the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 55</ref>

In January 1974, ''Mariner 10'' made ultraviolet observations of [[Comet Kohoutek]]. Another mid-course correction was made on 21 January 1974.

== Venus flyby ==
The spacecraft passed Venus on 5 February 1974, the closest approach being {{convert|5768|km}} at 17:01 UTC. It was the twelfth spacecraft to reach Venus and the eighth to return data from the planet,<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David R.|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|title=Chronology of Venus Exploration|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |work=National Space Science Data Center|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=8 September 2015|archivedate=July 30, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730111434/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as the first mission to succeed in broadcasting images of Venus back to Earth.<ref name=\"Ulivi181\">Ulivi and Harland 2007, p. 181</ref> ''Mariner 10'' built upon observations made by ''Mariner 5'' six years earlier; importantly, ''Mariner 10'' had a camera whereas the prior mission lacked one.<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\">Reeves 1994, p. 244</ref> As ''Mariner 10'' veered around Venus, from the planet's night side to daylight, the cameras snapped the probe's first image of Venus, showing an illuminated arc of clouds over the north pole emerging from darkness. Engineers initially feared that the star-tracker could mistake the much brighter Venus for Canopus, repeating the mishaps with flaking paint. However, the star-tracker did not malfunction. Earth occultation occurred between 17:07 and 17:11 UTC, during which the spacecraft transmitted X-band radio waves through Venus' atmosphere, gathering data on cloud structure and temperature.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 61-64</ref><ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 61-63</ref> Although Venus's cloud cover is nearly featureless in visible light, it was discovered that extensive cloud detail could be seen through Mariner's ultraviolet camera filters. Earth-based ultra-violet observation had shown some indistinct blotching even before ''Mariner 10'', but the detail seen by Mariner was a surprise to most researchers. The probe continued photographing Venus until 13 February 1974.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 79 </ref> Among the encounter's 4165 acquired photographs, one resulting series of images captured a thick and distinctly patterned atmosphere making a full revolution every four days,<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\"/> just as terrestrial observations had suggested.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 68</ref>

The mission revealed the composition and meteorological nature of the atmosphere of Venus. Data from the radio science experiment measured the extent to which radio waves passing through the atmosphere were refracted, which was used to calculate the density, pressure, and temperature of the atmosphere at any given altitude.<ref name=\"Howard\">{{cite journal|first1=H.

== End of mission ==
With its maneuvering gas just about exhausted, ''Mariner 10'' started another orbit of the Sun. Engineering tests were continued until 24 March 1975,<ref name=\"Mission Overview\"/> when final depletion of the nitrogen supply was signaled by the onset of an un-programmed pitch turn. Commands were sent immediately to the spacecraft to turn off its transmitter, and radio signals to Earth ceased.

''Mariner 10'' is presumably still [[heliocentric orbit|orbiting the Sun]], although its electronics have probably been damaged by the Sun's radiation.<ref>[http://www.space.com/18301-mariner-10.html  Elizabeth Howell, SPACE.com Contributor Article on mariner-10 at space.com]</ref> ''Mariner 10'' has not been spotted or tracked from Earth since it stopped transmitting. The only ways it would not be orbiting would be if it had been hit by an asteroid or gravitationally perturbed by a close encounter with a large body.

== Discoveries ==
During its flyby of Venus, ''Mariner 10'' discovered evidence of rotating clouds and a very weak magnetic field. Using a near-[[ultraviolet]] filter, it photographed Venus's [[Cirrus uncinus cloud|chevron clouds]] and performed other [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies.

The spacecraft flew past Mercury three times. Owing to the geometry of its orbit – its orbital period was almost exactly twice Mercury's – the same side of Mercury was sunlit each time, so it was only able to [[map]] 40–45% of Mercury's surface, taking over 2800 photos. It revealed a more or less Moon-like surface. It thus contributed enormously to our understanding of Mercury, whose surface had not been successfully resolved through telescopic observation. The regions mapped included most or all of the Shakespeare, Beethoven, Kuiper, Michelangelo, Tolstoj, and Discovery [[list of quadrangles on Mercury |quadrangle]]s, half of Bach and Victoria quadrangles, and small portions of Solitudo Persephones (later Neruda), Liguria (later Raditladi), and Borealis quadrangles.<ref name=\"h8.pdf\">{{cite book |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/PlanetaryMapping/DIGGEOL/mercury/h8/h8.pdf|title=Geologic Map of the Tolstoj (H-8) Quadrangle of Mercury|last1= Schaber|first1=Gerald G.|last2=McCauley|first2=John F.|id=USGS Miscellaneous Investigations Series Map I–1199, as part of the Atlas of Mercury, 1:5,000,000 Geologic Series|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' also discovered that Mercury has a tenuous [[Atmosphere of Mercury|atmosphere]] consisting primarily of [[helium]], as well as a [[magnetic field]] and a large iron-rich [[planetary core|core]]. Its radiometer readings suggested that Mercury has a nighttime temperature of −183 °C (−297 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) and maximum daytime temperatures of 187 °C (369 °F).

Planning for ''[[MESSENGER]]'', a spacecraft that surveyed Mercury until 2015, relied extensively on data and information collected by ''Mariner 10''.

'''''Mariner 10''''' was an American [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[space probe]] launched by [[NASA]] on 3 November 1973, to fly by the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]. It was the first spacecraft to perform flybys of multiple planets.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404|isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' was launched approximately two years after ''[[Mariner 9]]'' and was the last spacecraft in the [[Mariner program]]. (Mariner 11 and 12 were allocated to the [[Voyager program]] and redesignated ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]''.)

The mission objectives were to measure Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the [[interplanetary medium]] and to obtain experience with a dual-planet [[gravity assist]] mission. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s science team was led by [[Bruce C. Murray]] at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].<ref name=Schudel>{{cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Bruce C.

''Mariner 10'' was the first spacecraft to make use of an interplanetary [[gravitational slingshot]] maneuver, using Venus to bend its flight path and bring its [[perihelion]] down to the level of Mercury's orbit.<ref name=\"Mission Overview\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=2 February 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140219012506/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|archive-date=19 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404 |isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> This maneuver, inspired by the [[orbital mechanics]] calculations of the Italian scientist [[Giuseppe Colombo]], put the spacecraft into an orbit that repeatedly brought it back to Mercury. ''Mariner 10'' used the solar [[radiation pressure]] on its [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and its high-gain antenna as a means of [[attitude control]] during flight, the first spacecraft to use active solar pressure control.

The components on ''Mariner 10'' can be categorized into four groups based on their common function. The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub, which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism. The hub stored the spacecraft's internal electronics.<ref name=\"NSSDC\"/><ref>Clark 2007, pp. 22-23 </ref><ref name=\"Strom16\"/> The Mariner 10 spacecraft was manufactured by Boeing.<ref name=\"Mariner 10 Quicklook\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10 Quicklook |url=http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/mariner10QL.html&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> NASA set a strict limit of US$98 million for Mariner 10's total cost, which marked the first time the agency subjected a mission to an inflexible budget constraint. No overruns would be tolerated, so mission planners carefully considered cost efficiency when designing the spacecraft's instruments.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 222</ref> Cost control was primarily accomplished by executing contract work closer to the launch date than was recommended by normal mission schedules, as reducing the length of available work time increased cost efficiency. Despite the rushed schedule, very few deadlines were missed.<ref name=\"Biggs\"/> The mission ended up about US$1 million under budget.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 142</ref>

The flyby past Mercury posed major technical challenges for scientists to overcome. Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32–33</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 °C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76°.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30–32</ref>

Accurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25–26</ref>

The mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)

== Instruments ==
[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]

''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury. Six of these experiments had a dedicated scientific instrument to collect data.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p.19</ref> The experiments and instruments were designed by research laboratories and educational institutions from across the United States.<ref>Giberson and Cunningham 1975, p. 719</ref> Out of forty-six submissions, JPL selected seven experiments on the basis of maximizing science return without exceeding cost guidelines: together, the seven scientific experiments cost US12.6 million dollars, about one-eighth of the total mission budget.<ref name=\"Biggs\">{{Citation|last=Biggs|first=John R.|author-link=|last2=Downhower|first2=Walter J.|author2-link=|title=Mariner Venus/Mercury '73: A Strategy of Cost Control|journal=Astronautics & Aeronautics|volume=12|issue=5|pages=48–53|publisher=The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=New York|date=June 1974|language=|url=|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Television photography===
The imaging system, the Television Photography Experiment, consisted of two {{convert|15|cm}} [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] telescopes feeding [[vidicon]] tubes.<ref name=nssdccam>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-01 NASA/NSSDC – Mariner 10 – Television Photography]</ref> The main telescope could be bypassed to a smaller wide angle optic, but using the same tube.<ref name=nssdccam/> It had an 8-position filter wheel, with one position occupied by a mirror for the wide-angle bypass.<ref name=nssdccam/>

The entire imaging system was imperiled when electric heaters attached to the cameras failed to turn on immediately after launch. To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 °C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43–48</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on. This allowed the vidicons to be turned off as needed.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 57–58</ref>

Of the six main scientific instruments, the {{convert|43.6|kg}} cameras were by far the most massive device. Requiring 67 watts of electricity, the cameras consumed more power than the other five instruments combined.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> The system returned about 7000 photographs of Mercury and Venus during Mariner 10's flybys.<ref name=nssdccam/>

===Infrared radiometer===
The infrared [[radiometer]] detected [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] given off by the surface of Mercury and the atmosphere of Venus, from which the temperature could be calculated. How quickly the surface lost heat as it rotated into the planet's dark side revealed aspects about the composition of the surface, such as whether it was made out of rocks, or out of finer particles.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 21-22</ref><ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> The infrared radiometer contained a pair of Cassegrain telescopes fixed at an angle of 120° to each other and a pair of detectors made from antimony-bismuth [[thermopile]]s. The instrument was designed to measure temperatures as cold as -193 °C and as hot as 427 °C. Stillman C. Chase, Jr. of the Santa Barbara Research Center headed the infrared radiometer experiment.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\">{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Science Instrument Survey|publisher=Ames Research Center, NASA|series=|volume=|edition=|date=May 1973 |location=Moffett Field|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143/page/n153 148]–167|language=|url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143|doi=|id=|isbn=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Ultraviolet spectrometers===
Two ultraviolet [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] were involved in this experiment, one to measure UV absorption, the other to sense UV emissions. The occultation spectrometer scanned Mercury's edge as it passed in front of the Sun, and detected whether solar ultraviolet radiation was absorbed in certain wavelengths, which would indicate the presence of gas particles, and therefore an atmosphere.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 25-26</ref> The [[airglow]] spectrometer detected extreme ultraviolet radiation emanating from atoms of gaseous hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and argon.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/><ref>Rothery 2015, p. 26</ref> Unlike the occultation spectrometer, it did not require backlighting from the Sun and could move along with the rotatable scan platform on the spacecraft. The experiment's most important goal was to ascertain whether Mercury had an atmosphere, but would also gather data at Earth and Venus and study the interstellar background radiation.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 18-19</ref>

===Plasma detectors===
The plasma experiment's goal was to study the ionized gases ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) of the solar wind, the temperature and density of its electrons, and how the planets affected the velocity of the plasma stream.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer and Electron Spectrometer|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|work=National Space Science Data Center|date=|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-03|format=|doi=|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> The experiment contained two components, facing in opposite directions. The Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer was aimed toward the Sun and could detect positive ions and electrons, which were separated by a set of three concentric hemispherical plates. The Scanning Electron Spectrometer has aimed away from the Sun, and detected only electrons, using just one hemispherical plate. The instruments could be rotated about 60° to either side.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> By gathering data on the solar wind's movement around Mercury, the plasma experiment could be used to verify the magnetometer's observations of Mercury's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> Using the plasma detectors, Mariner 10 gathered the first ''in situ'' solar wind data from inside Venus' orbit.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 22-23</ref>

Shortly after launch, scientists found that the Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer had failed because a door shielding the analyzer did not open. An unsuccessful attempt was made to forcibly unfasten the door with the first course correction maneuver.<ref name=\"No. 7\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 7: First Trajectory Correction Maneuver A Success|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=13 November 1973|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-07.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> The experiment operators had planned to observe the directions taken by positive ions prior to the ions' collision with the Analyzer, but this data was lost.<ref name=\"No. 15\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 15: Venus Flyby Set For Tuesday at 10:01 A.M.

===Charged particle telescopes===
The goal of the charged particles experiment was to observe how the [[heliosphere]] interacted with [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]].<ref name=\"Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 19 </ref> In connection with the plasma detectors and magnetometers, this experiment had the potential to provide additional evidence of a magnetic field around Mercury,<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 28</ref> by showing whether such a field had captured charged particles.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> Two telescopes were used to collect highly energetic electrons and atomic nuclei, specifically oxygen nuclei or less massive.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\">Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24</ref> These particles then passed through a set of detectors and were counted.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/>

===Magnetometers===
Two fluxgate magnetometers were entrusted with discerning whether Mercury produced a [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]],<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 27</ref> and studying the interplanetary magnetic field between flybys.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\"/> In designing this experiment, scientists had to account for interference from the magnetic field generated by Mariner 10's many electronic parts. For this reason, the magnetometers had to be situated on a long boom, one closer to the octagonal hub, the other one further away. Data from the two magnetometers would be cross-referenced to filter out the spacecraft's own magnetic field.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 95</ref> Drastically weakening the probe's magnetic field would have increased costs.<ref name=\"Shirley\"/>

===Celestial Mechanics and Radio Science experiment===
This experiment investigated the mass and gravitational characteristics of Mercury. It was of particular interest because of the planet's closeness to the Sun, large orbital eccentricity, and unusual spin-orbit resonance.<ref name=NASAHistory/>

As the spacecraft passed behind Mercury on the first encounter there was an opportunity to probe the atmosphere and to measure the radius of the planet. By observing phase changes in the S-band radio signal, measurements of the atmosphere could be made. The atmosphere was assessed as having a density of about {{val| |e=16|u=molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref name=NASAHistory>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/ mariner.htm History article on Mariner 10 at history.nasa.gov]</ref>

== Departing the Earth–Moon system ==
[[File:Earth & Moon by Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|left|''Mariner 10'' imaged the Earth and Moon shortly after launch.]]

Boeing finished building the spacecraft at the end of June 1973, and ''Mariner 10'' was delivered from Seattle to JPL's headquarters in California, where JPL comprehensively tested the integrity of the spacecraft and its instruments. After the tests were finished, the probe was transported to the [[Eastern Test Range]] in Florida, the launch site. Technicians filled a tank on the spacecraft with {{convert|29|kg}} of hydrazine fuel so that the probe could make course corrections, and attached [[Squib (explosive)|squibs]], whose detonation would signal ''Mariner 10'' to exit the launch rocket and deploy its instruments.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 42</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 36-37</ref> The planned gravity assist at Venus made it feasible to use an [[Atlas-Centaur]] rocket instead of a more powerful but more expensive [[Titan IIIC]].<ref name=\"Paul\">{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Floyd A.|authorlink=|title=Technical Memorandum 33-759: A Study of Mariner 10 Flight Experiences and Some Flight Piece Part Failure Rate Computations|website=|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=January 15, 1976|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760010079.pdf|format=|doi=

On 3 November at 17:45 UTC, the Atlas-Centaur carrying ''Mariner 10'' lifted off from pad [[Spaceport Florida Launch Complex 36|SLC-36B]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/displayTrajectory.action?id=1973-085A|title=Mariner 10 Launch and Trajectory Information|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> The Atlas stage burned for around four minutes, after which it was jettisoned, and the Centaur stage took over for an additional five minutes, propelling ''Mariner 10'' to a [[parking orbit]]. The temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around Earth: this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the Centaur engines, which set ''Mariner 10'' on a path towards Venus. The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision. Never before had a planetary mission depended upon two separate rocket burns during the launch, and even with ''Mariner 10'', scientists initially viewed the maneuver as too risky.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowles|first=Mark D.|authorlink=

During its first week of flight, the ''Mariner 10'' camera system was tested by taking five [[Panoramic photography|photographic mosaics]] of the [[Earth]] and six of the [[Moon]]. It also obtained photographs of the north polar region of the Moon where prior coverage was poor. These photographs provided a basis for cartographers to update lunar maps and improve the [[Selenographic coordinates|lunar control net]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 47–53.</ref>

== Cruise to Venus ==
[[File:Mariner-10-Trajectory-first half.PNG|thumb|left|The trajectory of ''Mariner 10'' spacecraft: since launch on 3 November 1973, to first fly-by of Mercury on 29 March 1974.]]

Far from being an uneventful cruise, ''Mariner 10''{{’}}s three-month journey to Venus was fraught with technical malfunctions, which kept mission control on edge.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 55</ref> [[Donna Shirley]] recounted her team's frustration: \"It seemed as if we were always just patching Mariner 10 together long enough to get it on to the next phase and next crisis\".<ref>Shirley 1998, p. 91 </ref> A trajectory correction maneuver was made on 13 November 1973. Immediately afterward, the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star [[Canopus]]. An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator. Mission planners feared that the same problem could recur in the redundant system and cripple the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 55</ref>

In January 1974, ''Mariner 10'' made ultraviolet observations of [[Comet Kohoutek]]. Another mid-course correction was made on 21 January 1974.

== Venus flyby ==
The spacecraft passed Venus on 5 February 1974, the closest approach being {{convert|5768|km}} at 17:01 UTC. It was the twelfth spacecraft to reach Venus and the eighth to return data from the planet,<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David R.|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|title=Chronology of Venus Exploration|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |work=National Space Science Data Center|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=8 September 2015|archivedate=July 30, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730111434/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as the first mission to succeed in broadcasting images of Venus back to Earth.<ref name=\"Ulivi181\">Ulivi and Harland 2007, p. 181</ref> ''Mariner 10'' built upon observations made by ''Mariner 5'' six years earlier; importantly, ''Mariner 10'' had a camera whereas the prior mission lacked one.<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\">Reeves 1994, p. 244</ref> As ''Mariner 10'' veered around Venus, from the planet's night side to daylight, the cameras snapped the probe's first image of Venus, showing an illuminated arc of clouds over the north pole emerging from darkness. Engineers initially feared that the star-tracker could mistake the much brighter Venus for Canopus, repeating the mishaps with flaking paint. However, the star-tracker did not malfunction. Earth occultation occurred between 17:07 UTC and 17:11 UTC, during which the spacecraft transmitted X-band radio waves through Venus' atmosphere, gathering data on cloud structure and temperature.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 61-64</ref><ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 61-63</ref> Although Venus's cloud cover is nearly featureless in visible light, it was discovered that extensive cloud detail could be seen through Mariner's ultraviolet camera filters. Earth-based ultra-violet observation had shown some indistinct blotching even before ''Mariner 10'', but the detail seen by Mariner was a surprise to most researchers. The probe continued photographing Venus until 13 February 1974.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 79 </ref> Among the encounter's 4165 acquired photographs, one resulting series of images captured a thick and distinctly patterned atmosphere making a full revolution every four days,<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\"/> just as terrestrial observations had suggested.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 68</ref>

The mission revealed the composition and meteorological nature of the atmosphere of Venus. Data from the radio science experiment measured the extent to which radio waves passing through the atmosphere were refracted, which was used to calculate the density, pressure, and temperature of the atmosphere at any given altitude.<ref name=\"Howard\">{{cite journal|first1=H.

== End of mission ==
With its maneuvering gas just about exhausted, ''Mariner 10'' started another orbit of the Sun. Engineering tests were continued until 24 March 1975,<ref name=\"Mission Overview\"/> when final depletion of the nitrogen supply was signaled by the onset of an un-programmed pitch turn. Commands were sent immediately to the spacecraft to turn off its transmitter, and radio signals to Earth ceased.

''Mariner 10'' is presumably still [[heliocentric orbit|orbiting the Sun]], although its electronics have probably been damaged by the Sun's radiation.<ref>[http://www.space.com/18301-mariner-10.html  Elizabeth Howell, SPACE.com Contributor Article on mariner-10 at space.com]</ref> ''Mariner 10'' has not been spotted or tracked from Earth since it stopped transmitting. The only ways it would not be orbiting would be if it had been hit by an asteroid or gravitationally perturbed by a close encounter with a large body.

== Discoveries ==
During its flyby of Venus, ''Mariner 10'' discovered evidence of rotating clouds and a very weak magnetic field. Using a near-[[ultraviolet]] filter, it photographed Venus's [[Cirrus uncinus cloud|chevron clouds]] and performed other [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies.

The spacecraft flew past Mercury three times. Owing to the geometry of its orbit – its orbital period was almost exactly twice Mercury's – the same side of Mercury was sunlit each time, so it was only able to [[map]] 40–45% of Mercury's surface, taking over 2800 photos. It revealed a more or less Moon-like surface. It thus contributed enormously to our understanding of Mercury, whose surface had not been successfully resolved through telescopic observation. The regions mapped included most or all of the Shakespeare, Beethoven, Kuiper, Michelangelo, Tolstoj, and Discovery [[list of quadrangles on Mercury |quadrangle]]s, half of Bach and Victoria quadrangles, and small portions of Solitudo Persephones (later Neruda), Liguria (later Raditladi), and Borealis quadrangles.<ref name=\"h8.pdf\">{{cite book |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/PlanetaryMapping/DIGGEOL/mercury/h8/h8.pdf|title=Geologic Map of the Tolstoj (H-8) Quadrangle of Mercury|last1= Schaber|first1=Gerald G.|last2=McCauley|first2=John F.|id=USGS Miscellaneous Investigations Series Map I–1199, as part of the Atlas of Mercury, 1:5,000,000 Geologic Series|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' also discovered that Mercury has a tenuous [[Atmosphere of Mercury|atmosphere]] consisting primarily of [[helium]], as well as a [[magnetic field]] and a large iron-rich [[planetary core|core]]. Its radiometer readings suggested that Mercury has a nighttime temperature of −183 °C (−297 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) and maximum daytime temperatures of 187 °C (369 °F).

Planning for ''[[MESSENGER]]'', a spacecraft that surveyed Mercury until 2015, relied extensively on data and information collected by ''Mariner 10''.

'''''Mariner 10''''' was an American [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[space probe]] launched by [[NASA]] on 3 November 1973, to fly by the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]. It was the first spacecraft to perform flybys of multiple planets.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404|isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' was launched approximately two years after ''[[Mariner 9]]'' and was the last spacecraft in the [[Mariner program]]. (Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 were allocated to the [[Voyager program]] and redesignated ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]''.)

The mission objectives were to measure Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the [[interplanetary medium]] and to obtain experience with a dual-planet [[gravity assist]] mission. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s science team was led by [[Bruce C. Murray]] at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].<ref name=Schudel>{{cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Bruce C.

''Mariner 10'' was the first spacecraft to make use of an interplanetary [[gravitational slingshot]] maneuver, using Venus to bend its flight path and bring its [[perihelion]] down to the level of Mercury's orbit.<ref name=\"Mission Overview\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=2 February 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140219012506/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|archive-date=19 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404 |isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> This maneuver, inspired by the [[orbital mechanics]] calculations of the Italian scientist [[Giuseppe Colombo]], put the spacecraft into an orbit that repeatedly brought it back to Mercury. ''Mariner 10'' used the solar [[radiation pressure]] on its [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and its high-gain antenna as a means of [[attitude control]] during flight, the first spacecraft to use active solar pressure control.

The components on ''Mariner 10'' can be categorized into four groups based on their common function. The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub, which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism. The hub stored the spacecraft's internal electronics.<ref name=\"NSSDC\"/><ref>Clark 2007, pp. 22-23 </ref><ref name=\"Strom16\"/> The Mariner 10 spacecraft was manufactured by Boeing.<ref name=\"Mariner 10 Quicklook\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10 Quicklook |url=http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/mariner10QL.html&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> NASA set a strict limit of US$98 million for Mariner 10's total cost, which marked the first time the agency subjected a mission to an inflexible budget constraint. No overruns would be tolerated, so mission planners carefully considered cost efficiency when designing the spacecraft's instruments.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 222</ref> Cost control was primarily accomplished by executing contract work closer to the launch date than was recommended by normal mission schedules, as reducing the length of available work time increased cost efficiency. Despite the rushed schedule, very few deadlines were missed.<ref name=\"Biggs\"/> The mission ended up about US$1 million under budget.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 142</ref>

The flyby past Mercury posed major technical challenges for scientists to overcome. Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32–33</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 °C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76°.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30–32</ref>

Accurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25–26</ref>

The mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)

== Instruments ==
[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]

''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury. Six of these experiments had a dedicated scientific instrument to collect data.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p.19</ref> The experiments and instruments were designed by research laboratories and educational institutions from across the United States.<ref>Giberson and Cunningham 1975, p. 719</ref> Out of forty-six submissions, JPL selected seven experiments on the basis of maximizing science return without exceeding cost guidelines: together, the seven scientific experiments cost US12.6 million dollars, about one-eighth of the total mission budget.<ref name=\"Biggs\">{{Citation|last=Biggs|first=John R.|author-link=|last2=Downhower|first2=Walter J.|author2-link=|title=Mariner Venus/Mercury '73: A Strategy of Cost Control|journal=Astronautics & Aeronautics|volume=12|issue=5|pages=48–53|publisher=The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=New York|date=June 1974|language=|url=|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Television photography===
The imaging system, the Television Photography Experiment, consisted of two {{convert|15|cm}} [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] telescopes feeding [[vidicon]] tubes.<ref name=nssdccam>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-01 NASA/NSSDC – Mariner 10 – Television Photography]</ref> The main telescope could be bypassed to a smaller wide angle optic, but using the same tube.<ref name=nssdccam/> It had an 8-position filter wheel, with one position occupied by a mirror for the wide-angle bypass.<ref name=nssdccam/>

The entire imaging system was imperiled when electric heaters attached to the cameras failed to turn on immediately after launch. To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 °C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43–48</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on. This allowed the vidicons to be turned off as needed.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 57–58</ref>

Of the six main scientific instruments, the {{convert|43.6|kg}} cameras were by far the most massive device. Requiring 67 watts of electricity, the cameras consumed more power than the other five instruments combined.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> The system returned about 7000 photographs of Mercury and Venus during Mariner 10's flybys.<ref name=nssdccam/>

===Infrared radiometer===
The infrared [[radiometer]] detected [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] given off by the surface of Mercury and the atmosphere of Venus, from which the temperature could be calculated. How quickly the surface lost heat as it rotated into the planet's dark side revealed aspects about the composition of the surface, such as whether it was made out of rocks, or out of finer particles.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 21-22</ref><ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> The infrared radiometer contained a pair of Cassegrain telescopes fixed at an angle of 120° to each other and a pair of detectors made from antimony-bismuth [[thermopile]]s. The instrument was designed to measure temperatures as cold as -193 °C and as hot as 427 °C. Stillman C. Chase, Jr. of the Santa Barbara Research Center headed the infrared radiometer experiment.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\">{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Science Instrument Survey|publisher=Ames Research Center, NASA|series=|volume=|edition=|date=May 1973 |location=Moffett Field|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143/page/n153 148]–167|language=|url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143|doi=|id=|isbn=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Ultraviolet spectrometers===
Two ultraviolet [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] were involved in this experiment, one to measure UV absorption, the other to sense UV emissions. The occultation spectrometer scanned Mercury's edge as it passed in front of the Sun, and detected whether solar ultraviolet radiation was absorbed in certain wavelengths, which would indicate the presence of gas particles, and therefore an atmosphere.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 25-26</ref> The [[airglow]] spectrometer detected extreme ultraviolet radiation emanating from atoms of gaseous hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and argon.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/><ref>Rothery 2015, p. 26</ref> Unlike the occultation spectrometer, it did not require backlighting from the Sun and could move along with the rotatable scan platform on the spacecraft. The experiment's most important goal was to ascertain whether Mercury had an atmosphere, but would also gather data at Earth and Venus and study the interstellar background radiation.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 18-19</ref>

===Plasma detectors===
The plasma experiment's goal was to study the ionized gases ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) of the solar wind, the temperature and density of its electrons, and how the planets affected the velocity of the plasma stream.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer and Electron Spectrometer|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|work=National Space Science Data Center|date=|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-03|format=|doi=|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> The experiment contained two components, facing in opposite directions. The Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer was aimed toward the Sun and could detect positive ions and electrons, which were separated by a set of three concentric hemispherical plates. The Scanning Electron Spectrometer has aimed away from the Sun, and detected only electrons, using just one hemispherical plate. The instruments could be rotated about 60° to either side.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> By gathering data on the solar wind's movement around Mercury, the plasma experiment could be used to verify the magnetometer's observations of Mercury's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> Using the plasma detectors, Mariner 10 gathered the first ''in situ'' solar wind data from inside Venus' orbit.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 22-23</ref>

Shortly after launch, scientists found that the Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer had failed because a door shielding the analyzer did not open. An unsuccessful attempt was made to forcibly unfasten the door with the first course correction maneuver.<ref name=\"No. 7\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 7: First Trajectory Correction Maneuver A Success|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=13 November 1973|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-07.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> The experiment operators had planned to observe the directions taken by positive ions prior to the ions' collision with the Analyzer, but this data was lost.<ref name=\"No. 15\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 15: Venus Flyby Set For Tuesday at 10:01 A.M.

===Charged particle telescopes===
The goal of the charged particles experiment was to observe how the [[heliosphere]] interacted with [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]].<ref name=\"Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 19 </ref> In connection with the plasma detectors and magnetometers, this experiment had the potential to provide additional evidence of a magnetic field around Mercury,<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 28</ref> by showing whether such a field had captured charged particles.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> Two telescopes were used to collect highly energetic electrons and atomic nuclei, specifically oxygen nuclei or less massive.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\">Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24</ref> These particles then passed through a set of detectors and were counted.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/>

===Magnetometers===
Two fluxgate magnetometers were entrusted with discerning whether Mercury produced a [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]],<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 27</ref> and studying the interplanetary magnetic field between flybys.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\"/> In designing this experiment, scientists had to account for interference from the magnetic field generated by Mariner 10's many electronic parts. For this reason, the magnetometers had to be situated on a long boom, one closer to the octagonal hub, the other one further away. Data from the two magnetometers would be cross-referenced to filter out the spacecraft's own magnetic field.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 95</ref> Drastically weakening the probe's magnetic field would have increased costs.<ref name=\"Shirley\"/>

===Celestial Mechanics and Radio Science experiment===
This experiment investigated the mass and gravitational characteristics of Mercury. It was of particular interest because of the planet's closeness to the Sun, large orbital eccentricity, and unusual spin-orbit resonance.<ref name=NASAHistory/>

As the spacecraft passed behind Mercury on the first encounter there was an opportunity to probe the atmosphere and to measure the radius of the planet. By observing phase changes in the S-band radio signal, measurements of the atmosphere could be made. The atmosphere was assessed as having a density of about {{val| |e=16|u=molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref name=NASAHistory>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/ mariner.htm History article on Mariner 10 at history.nasa.gov]</ref>

== Departing the Earth–Moon system ==
[[File:Earth & Moon by Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|left|''Mariner 10'' imaged the Earth and Moon shortly after launch.]]

Boeing finished building the spacecraft at the end of June 1973, and ''Mariner 10'' was delivered from Seattle to JPL's headquarters in California, where JPL comprehensively tested the integrity of the spacecraft and its instruments. After the tests were finished, the probe was transported to the [[Eastern Test Range]] in Florida, the launch site. Technicians filled a tank on the spacecraft with {{convert|29|kg}} of hydrazine fuel so that the probe could make course corrections, and attached [[Squib (explosive)|squibs]], whose detonation would signal ''Mariner 10'' to exit the launch rocket and deploy its instruments.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 42</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 36-37</ref> The planned gravity assist at Venus made it feasible to use an [[Atlas-Centaur]] rocket instead of a more powerful but more expensive [[Titan IIIC]].<ref name=\"Paul\">{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Floyd A.|authorlink=|title=Technical Memorandum 33-759: A Study of Mariner 10 Flight Experiences and Some Flight Piece Part Failure Rate Computations|website=|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=January 15, 1976|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760010079.pdf|format=|doi=

[[File:Atlas-Centaur launch with Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Launch of ''Mariner 10'']]

On 3 November at 17:45 UTC, the Atlas-Centaur carrying ''Mariner 10'' lifted off from pad [[Spaceport Florida Launch Complex 36|SLC-36B]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/displayTrajectory.action?id=1973-085A|title=Mariner 10 Launch and Trajectory Information|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> The Atlas stage burned for around four minutes, after which it was jettisoned, and the Centaur stage took over for an additional five minutes, propelling ''Mariner 10'' to a [[parking orbit]]. The temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around Earth: this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the Centaur engines, which set ''Mariner 10'' on a path towards Venus. The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision. Never before had a planetary mission depended upon two separate rocket burns during the launch, and even with ''Mariner 10'', scientists initially viewed the maneuver as too risky.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowles|first=Mark D.|authorlink=

During its first week of flight, the ''Mariner 10'' camera system was tested by taking five [[Panoramic photography|photographic mosaics]] of the [[Earth]] and six of the [[Moon]]. It also obtained photographs of the north polar region of the Moon where prior coverage was poor. These photographs provided a basis for cartographers to update lunar maps and improve the [[Selenographic coordinates|lunar control net]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 47–53.</ref>

== Cruise to Venus ==
[[File:Mariner-10-Trajectory-first half.PNG|thumb|left|The trajectory of ''Mariner 10'' spacecraft: since launch on 3 November 1973, to first fly-by of Mercury on 29 March 1974.]]

Far from being an uneventful cruise, ''Mariner 10''{{’}}s three-month journey to Venus was fraught with technical malfunctions, which kept mission control on edge.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 55</ref> [[Donna Shirley]] recounted her team's frustration: \"It seemed as if we were always just patching Mariner 10 together long enough to get it on to the next phase and next crisis\".<ref>Shirley 1998, p. 91 </ref> A trajectory correction maneuver was made on 13 November 1973. Immediately afterward, the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star [[Canopus]]. An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator. Mission planners feared that the same problem could recur in the redundant system and cripple the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 55</ref>

In January 1974, ''Mariner 10'' made ultraviolet observations of [[Comet Kohoutek]]. Another mid-course correction was made on 21 January 1974.

== Venus flyby ==
The spacecraft passed Venus on 5 February 1974, the closest approach being {{convert|5768|km}} at 17:01 UTC. It was the twelfth spacecraft to reach Venus and the eighth to return data from the planet,<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David R.|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|title=Chronology of Venus Exploration|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |work=National Space Science Data Center|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=8 September 2015|archivedate=July 30, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730111434/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as the first mission to succeed in broadcasting images of Venus back to Earth.<ref name=\"Ulivi181\">Ulivi and Harland 2007, p. 181</ref> ''Mariner 10'' built upon observations made by ''Mariner 5'' six years earlier; importantly, ''Mariner 10'' had a camera whereas the prior mission lacked one.<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\">Reeves 1994, p. 244</ref> As ''Mariner 10'' veered around Venus, from the planet's night side to daylight, the cameras snapped the probe's first image of Venus, showing an illuminated arc of clouds over the north pole emerging from darkness. Engineers initially feared that the star-tracker could mistake the much brighter Venus for Canopus, repeating the mishaps with flaking paint. However, the star-tracker did not malfunction. Earth occultation occurred between 17:07 and 17:11 UTC, during which the spacecraft transmitted X-band radio waves through Venus' atmosphere, gathering data on cloud structure and temperature.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 61-64</ref><ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 61-63</ref> Although Venus's cloud cover is nearly featureless in visible light, it was discovered that extensive cloud detail could be seen through Mariner's ultraviolet camera filters. Earth-based ultra-violet observation had shown some indistinct blotching even before ''Mariner 10'', but the detail seen by Mariner was a surprise to most researchers. The probe continued photographing Venus until 13 February 1974.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 79 </ref> Among the encounter's 4165 acquired photographs, one resulting series of images captured a thick and distinctly patterned atmosphere making a full revolution every four days,<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\"/> just as terrestrial observations had suggested.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 68</ref>

The mission revealed the composition and meteorological nature of the atmosphere of Venus. Data from the radio science experiment measured the extent to which radio waves passing through the atmosphere were refracted, which was used to calculate the density, pressure, and temperature of the atmosphere at any given altitude.<ref name=\"Howard\">{{cite journal|first1=H.

== End of mission ==
With its maneuvering gas just about exhausted, ''Mariner 10'' started another orbit of the Sun. Engineering tests were continued until 24 March 1975,<ref name=\"Mission Overview\"/> when final depletion of the nitrogen supply was signaled by the onset of an un-programmed pitch turn. Commands were sent immediately to the spacecraft to turn off its transmitter, and radio signals to Earth ceased.

''Mariner 10'' is presumably still [[heliocentric orbit|orbiting the Sun]], although its electronics have probably been damaged by the Sun's radiation.<ref>[http://www.space.com/18301-mariner-10.html  Elizabeth Howell, SPACE.com Contributor Article on mariner-10 at space.com]</ref> ''Mariner 10'' has not been spotted or tracked from Earth since it stopped transmitting. The only ways it would not be orbiting would be if it had been hit by an asteroid or gravitationally perturbed by a close encounter with a large body.

== Discoveries ==
During its flyby of Venus, ''Mariner 10'' discovered evidence of rotating clouds and a very weak magnetic field. Using a near-[[ultraviolet]] filter, it photographed Venus's [[Cirrus uncinus cloud|chevron clouds]] and performed other [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies.

The spacecraft flew past Mercury three times. Owing to the geometry of its orbit – its orbital period was almost exactly twice Mercury's – the same side of Mercury was sunlit each time, so it was only able to [[map]] 40–45% of Mercury's surface, taking over 2800 photos. It revealed a more or less Moon-like surface. It thus contributed enormously to our understanding of Mercury, whose surface had not been successfully resolved through telescopic observation. The regions mapped included most or all of the Shakespeare, Beethoven, Kuiper, Michelangelo, Tolstoj, and Discovery [[list of quadrangles on Mercury |quadrangle]]s, half of Bach and Victoria quadrangles, and small portions of Solitudo Persephones (later Neruda), Liguria (later Raditladi), and Borealis quadrangles.<ref name=\"h8.pdf\">{{cite book |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/PlanetaryMapping/DIGGEOL/mercury/h8/h8.pdf|title=Geologic Map of the Tolstoj (H-8) Quadrangle of Mercury|last1= Schaber|first1=Gerald G.|last2=McCauley|first2=John F.|id=USGS Miscellaneous Investigations Series Map I–1199, as part of the Atlas of Mercury, 1:5,000,000 Geologic Series|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' also discovered that Mercury has a tenuous [[Atmosphere of Mercury|atmosphere]] consisting primarily of [[helium]], as well as a [[magnetic field]] and a large iron-rich [[planetary core|core]]. Its radiometer readings suggested that Mercury has a nighttime temperature of −183 °C (−297 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) and maximum daytime temperatures of 187 °C (369 °F).

Planning for ''[[MESSENGER]]'', a spacecraft that surveyed Mercury until 2015, relied extensively on data and information collected by ''Mariner 10''.

'''''Mariner 10''''' was an American [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[space probe]] launched by [[NASA]] on 3 November 1973, to fly by the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]. It was the first spacecraft to perform flybys of multiple planets.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404|isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' was launched approximately two years after ''[[Mariner 9]]'' and was the last spacecraft in the [[Mariner program]]. (Mariner 11 and 12 were allocated to the [[Voyager program]] and redesignated ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]''.)

The mission objectives were to measure Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the [[interplanetary medium]] and to obtain experience with a dual-planet [[gravity assist]] mission. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s science team was led by [[Bruce C. Murray]] at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].<ref name=Schudel>{{cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Bruce C.

''Mariner 10'' was the first spacecraft to make use of an interplanetary [[gravitational slingshot]] maneuver, using Venus to bend its flight path and bring its [[perihelion]] down to the level of Mercury's orbit.<ref name=\"Mission Overview\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=2 February 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140219012506/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|archive-date=19 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404 |isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> This maneuver, inspired by the [[orbital mechanics]] calculations of the Italian scientist [[Giuseppe Colombo]], put the spacecraft into an orbit that repeatedly brought it back to Mercury. ''Mariner 10'' used the solar [[radiation pressure]] on its [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and its high-gain antenna as a means of [[attitude control]] during flight, the first spacecraft to use active solar pressure control.

The components on ''Mariner 10'' can be categorized into four groups based on their common function. The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub, which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism. The hub stored the spacecraft's internal electronics.<ref name=\"NSSDC\"/><ref>Clark 2007, pp. 22-23 </ref><ref name=\"Strom16\"/> The Mariner 10 spacecraft was manufactured by Boeing.<ref name=\"Mariner 10 Quicklook\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10 Quicklook |url=http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/mariner10QL.html&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> NASA set a strict limit of US$98 million for Mariner 10's total cost, which marked the first time the agency subjected a mission to an inflexible budget constraint. No overruns would be tolerated, so mission planners carefully considered cost efficiency when designing the spacecraft's instruments.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 222</ref> Cost control was primarily accomplished by executing contract work closer to the launch date than was recommended by normal mission schedules, as reducing the length of available work time increased cost efficiency. Despite the rushed schedule, very few deadlines were missed.<ref name=\"Biggs\"/> The mission ended up about US$1 million under budget.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 142</ref>

The flyby past Mercury posed major technical challenges for scientists to overcome. Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32–33</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 °C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76°.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30–32</ref>

Accurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25–26</ref>

The mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)

== Instruments ==
[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]

''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury. Six of these experiments had a dedicated scientific instrument to collect data.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p.19</ref> The experiments and instruments were designed by research laboratories and educational institutions from across the United States.<ref>Giberson and Cunningham 1975, p. 719</ref> Out of forty-six submissions, JPL selected seven experiments on the basis of maximizing science return without exceeding cost guidelines: together, the seven scientific experiments cost US12.6 million dollars, about one-eighth of the total mission budget.<ref name=\"Biggs\">{{Citation|last=Biggs|first=John R.|author-link=|last2=Downhower|first2=Walter J.|author2-link=|title=Mariner Venus/Mercury '73: A Strategy of Cost Control|journal=Astronautics & Aeronautics|volume=12|issue=5|pages=48–53|publisher=The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=New York|date=June 1974|language=|url=|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Television photography===
The imaging system, the Television Photography Experiment, consisted of two {{convert|15|cm}} [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] telescopes feeding [[vidicon]] tubes.<ref name=nssdccam>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-01 NASA/NSSDC – Mariner 10 – Television Photography]</ref> The main telescope could be bypassed to a smaller wide angle optic, but using the same tube.<ref name=nssdccam/> It had an 8-position filter wheel, with one position occupied by a mirror for the wide-angle bypass.<ref name=nssdccam/>

The entire imaging system was imperiled when electric heaters attached to the cameras failed to turn on immediately after launch. To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 °C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43–48</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on. This allowed the vidicons to be turned off as needed.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 57–58</ref>

Of the six main scientific instruments, the {{convert|43.6|kg}} cameras were by far the most massive device. Requiring 67 watts of electricity, the cameras consumed more power than the other five instruments combined.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> The system returned about 7000 photographs of Mercury and Venus during Mariner 10's flybys.<ref name=nssdccam/>

===Infrared radiometer===
The infrared [[radiometer]] detected [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] given off by the surface of Mercury and the atmosphere of Venus, from which the temperature could be calculated. How quickly the surface lost heat as it rotated into the planet's dark side revealed aspects about the composition of the surface, such as whether it was made out of rocks, or out of finer particles.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 21-22</ref><ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> The infrared radiometer contained a pair of Cassegrain telescopes fixed at an angle of 120° to each other and a pair of detectors made from antimony-bismuth [[thermopile]]s. The instrument was designed to measure temperatures as cold as -193 °C and as hot as 427 °C. Stillman C. Chase, Jr. of the Santa Barbara Research Center headed the infrared radiometer experiment.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\">{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Science Instrument Survey|publisher=Ames Research Center, NASA|series=|volume=|edition=|date=May 1973 |location=Moffett Field|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143/page/n153 148]–167|language=|url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143|doi=|id=|isbn=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Ultraviolet spectrometers===
Two ultraviolet [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] were involved in this experiment, one to measure UV absorption, the other to sense UV emissions. The occultation spectrometer scanned Mercury's edge as it passed in front of the Sun, and detected whether solar ultraviolet radiation was absorbed in certain wavelengths, which would indicate the presence of gas particles, and therefore an atmosphere.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 25-26</ref> The [[airglow]] spectrometer detected extreme ultraviolet radiation emanating from atoms of gaseous hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and argon.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/><ref>Rothery 2015, p. 26</ref> Unlike the occultation spectrometer, it did not require backlighting from the Sun and could move along with the rotatable scan platform on the spacecraft. The experiment's most important goal was to ascertain whether Mercury had an atmosphere, but would also gather data at Earth and Venus and study the interstellar background radiation.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 18-19</ref>

===Plasma detectors===
The plasma experiment's goal was to study the ionized gases ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) of the solar wind, the temperature and density of its electrons, and how the planets affected the velocity of the plasma stream.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer and Electron Spectrometer|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|work=National Space Science Data Center|date=|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-03|format=|doi=|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> The experiment contained two components, facing in opposite directions. The Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer was aimed toward the Sun and could detect positive ions and electrons, which were separated by a set of three concentric hemispherical plates. The Scanning Electron Spectrometer has aimed away from the Sun, and detected only electrons, using just one hemispherical plate. The instruments could be rotated about 60° to either side.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> By gathering data on the solar wind's movement around Mercury, the plasma experiment could be used to verify the magnetometer's observations of Mercury's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> Using the plasma detectors, Mariner 10 gathered the first ''in situ'' solar wind data from inside Venus' orbit.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 22-23</ref>

Shortly after launch, scientists found that the Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer had failed because a door shielding the analyzer did not open. An unsuccessful attempt was made to forcibly unfasten the door with the first course correction maneuver.<ref name=\"No. 7\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 7: First Trajectory Correction Maneuver A Success|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=13 November 1973|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-07.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> The experiment operators had planned to observe the directions taken by positive ions prior to the ions' collision with the Analyzer, but this data was lost.<ref name=\"No. 15\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 15: Venus Flyby Set For Tuesday at 10:01 A.M.

===Charged particle telescopes===
The goal of the charged particles experiment was to observe how the [[heliosphere]] interacted with [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]].<ref name=\"Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 19 </ref> In connection with the plasma detectors and magnetometers, this experiment had the potential to provide additional evidence of a magnetic field around Mercury,<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 28</ref> by showing whether such a field had captured charged particles.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> Two telescopes were used to collect highly energetic electrons and atomic nuclei, specifically oxygen nuclei or less massive.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\">Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24</ref> These particles then passed through a set of detectors and were counted.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/>

===Magnetometers===
Two fluxgate magnetometers were entrusted with discerning whether Mercury produced a [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]],<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 27</ref> and studying the interplanetary magnetic field between flybys.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\"/> In designing this experiment, scientists had to account for interference from the magnetic field generated by Mariner 10's many electronic parts. For this reason, the magnetometers had to be situated on a long boom, one closer to the octagonal hub, the other one further away. Data from the two magnetometers would be cross-referenced to filter out the spacecraft's own magnetic field.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 95</ref> Drastically weakening the probe's magnetic field would have increased costs.<ref name=\"Shirley\"/>

===Celestial Mechanics and Radio Science experiment===
This experiment investigated the mass and gravitational characteristics of Mercury. It was of particular interest because of the planet's closeness to the Sun, large orbital eccentricity, and unusual spin-orbit resonance.<ref name=NASAHistory/>

As the spacecraft passed behind Mercury on the first encounter there was an opportunity to probe the atmosphere and to measure the radius of the planet. By observing phase changes in the S-band radio signal, measurements of the atmosphere could be made. The atmosphere was assessed as having a density of about {{val| |e=16|u=molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref name=NASAHistory>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/ mariner.htm History article on Mariner 10 at history.nasa.gov]</ref>

== Departing the Earth–Moon system ==
[[File:Earth & Moon by Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|left|''Mariner 10'' imaged the Earth and Moon shortly after launch.]]

Boeing finished building the spacecraft at the end of June 1973, and ''Mariner 10'' was delivered from Seattle to JPL's headquarters in California, where JPL comprehensively tested the integrity of the spacecraft and its instruments. After the tests were finished, the probe was transported to the [[Eastern Test Range]] in Florida, the launch site. Technicians filled a tank on the spacecraft with {{convert|29|kg}} of hydrazine fuel so that the probe could make course corrections, and attached [[Squib (explosive)|squibs]], whose detonation would signal ''Mariner 10'' to exit the launch rocket and deploy its instruments.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 42</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 36-37</ref> The planned gravity assist at Venus made it feasible to use an [[Atlas-Centaur]] rocket instead of a more powerful but more expensive [[Titan IIIC]].<ref name=\"Paul\">{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Floyd A.|authorlink=|title=Technical Memorandum 33-759: A Study of Mariner 10 Flight Experiences and Some Flight Piece Part Failure Rate Computations|website=|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=January 15, 1976|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760010079.pdf|format=|doi=

[[File:Atlas-Centaur launch with Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Launch of ''Mariner 10'']]

On 3 November at 17:45 UTC, the Atlas-Centaur carrying ''Mariner 10'' lifted off from pad [[Spaceport Florida Launch Complex 36|SLC-36B]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/displayTrajectory.action?id=1973-085A|title=Mariner 10 Launch and Trajectory Information|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> The Atlas stage burned for around four minutes, after which it was jettisoned, and the Centaur stage took over for an additional five minutes, propelling ''Mariner 10'' to a [[parking orbit]]. The temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around Earth: this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the Centaur engines, which set ''Mariner 10'' on a path towards Venus. The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision. Never before had a planetary mission depended upon two separate rocket burns during the launch, and even with ''Mariner 10'', scientists initially viewed the maneuver as too risky.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowles|first=Mark D.|authorlink=

During its first week of flight, the ''Mariner 10'' camera system was tested by taking five [[Panoramic photography|photographic mosaics]] of the [[Earth]] and six of the [[Moon]]. It also obtained photographs of the north polar region of the Moon where prior coverage was poor. These photographs provided a basis for cartographers to update lunar maps and improve the [[Selenographic coordinates|lunar control net]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 47–53.</ref>

== Cruise to Venus ==
[[File:Mariner-10-Trajectory-first half.PNG|thumb|left|The trajectory of ''Mariner 10'' spacecraft: since launch on 3 November 1973, to first fly-by of Mercury on 29 March 1974.]]

Far from being an uneventful cruise, ''Mariner 10''{{’}}s three-month journey to Venus was fraught with technical malfunctions, which kept mission control on edge.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 55</ref> [[Donna Shirley]] recounted her team's frustration: \"It seemed as if we were always just patching Mariner 10 together long enough to get it on to the next phase and next crisis\".<ref>Shirley 1998, p. 91 </ref> A trajectory correction maneuver was made on 13 November 1973. Immediately afterward, the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star [[Canopus]]. An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator. Mission planners feared that the same problem could recur in the redundant system and cripple the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 55</ref>

In January 1974, ''Mariner 10'' made ultraviolet observations of [[Comet Kohoutek]]. Another mid-course correction was made on 21 January 1974.

== Venus flyby ==
The spacecraft passed Venus on 5 February 1974, the closest approach being {{convert|5768|km}} at 17:01 UTC.

== End of mission ==
With its maneuvering gas just about exhausted, ''Mariner 10'' started another orbit of the Sun. Engineering tests were continued until 24 March 1975,<ref name=\"Mission Overview\"/> when final depletion of the nitrogen supply was signaled by the onset of an un-programmed pitch turn. Commands were sent immediately to the spacecraft to turn off its transmitter, and radio signals to Earth ceased.

''Mariner 10'' is presumably still [[heliocentric orbit|orbiting the Sun]], although its electronics have probably been damaged by the Sun's radiation.<ref>[http://www.space.com/18301-mariner-10.html  Elizabeth Howell, SPACE.com Contributor Article on mariner-10 at space.com]</ref> ''Mariner 10'' has not been spotted or tracked from Earth since it stopped transmitting. The only ways it would not be orbiting would be if it had been hit by an asteroid or gravitationally perturbed by a close encounter with a large body.

== Discoveries ==
During its flyby of Venus, ''Mariner 10'' discovered evidence of rotating clouds and a very weak magnetic field. Using a near-[[ultraviolet]] filter, it photographed Venus's [[Cirrus uncinus cloud|chevron clouds]] and performed other [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies.

The spacecraft flew past Mercury three times. Owing to the geometry of its orbit – its orbital period was almost exactly twice Mercury's – the same side of Mercury was sunlit each time, so it was only able to [[map]] 40–45% of Mercury's surface, taking over 2800 photos. It revealed a more or less Moon-like surface. It thus contributed enormously to our understanding of Mercury, whose surface had not been successfully resolved through telescopic observation. The regions mapped included most or all of the Shakespeare, Beethoven, Kuiper, Michelangelo, Tolstoj, and Discovery [[list of quadrangles on Mercury |quadrangle]]s, half of Bach and Victoria quadrangles, and small portions of Solitudo Persephones (later Neruda), Liguria (later Raditladi), and Borealis quadrangles.<ref name=\"h8.pdf\">{{cite book |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/PlanetaryMapping/DIGGEOL/mercury/h8/h8.pdf|title=Geologic Map of the Tolstoj (H-8) Quadrangle of Mercury|last1= Schaber|first1=Gerald G.|last2=McCauley|first2=John F.|id=USGS Miscellaneous Investigations Series Map I–1199, as part of the Atlas of Mercury, 1:5,000,000 Geologic Series|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' also discovered that Mercury has a tenuous [[Atmosphere of Mercury|atmosphere]] consisting primarily of [[helium]], as well as a [[magnetic field]] and a large iron-rich [[planetary core|core]]. Its radiometer readings suggested that Mercury has a nighttime temperature of −183 °C (−297 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) and maximum daytime temperatures of 187 °C (369 °F).

Planning for ''[[MESSENGER]]'', a spacecraft that surveyed Mercury until 2015, relied extensively on data and information collected by ''Mariner 10''.

A '''CD player''' is an electronic device that plays audio [[compact disc]]s, which are a [[digital audio|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|data storage]] format. CD players were first sold to consumers in 1982. CDs typically contain recordings of audio material such as music or [[audiobook]]s. CD players may be part of home [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] systems, [[car audio]] systems, [[personal computer]]s, or [[portable CD player]]s such as CD [[boombox]]es. Most CD players produce an output signal via a [[headphone]] jack or [[RCA jack]]s. To use a CD player in a home stereo system, the user connects an RCA cable from the RCA jacks to a [[hi-fi]] (or other [[power amplifier|amplifier]]) and [[loudspeaker]]s for listening to music.  To listen to music using a CD player with a headphone output jack, the user plugs headphones or earphones into the headphone jack. 

Modern units can play audio formats other than the original CD [[Pulse Code Modulation|PCM]] audio coding, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. [[DJ]]s playing [[dance music]] at clubs often use specialized players with an adjustable playback speed to alter the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and tempo of the music. [[Audio engineer]]s using CD players to play music for an event through a [[sound reinforcement system]] use professional audio-grade CD players. CD playback functionality is also available on CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive equipped computers as well as on [[DVD player]]s and most optical disc-based [[game console]]s.

The Compact Disc is an evolution of [[LaserDisc]] technology, where a focused [[laser]] beam
is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals.
Prototypes were developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] independently in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of the CD|url=http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/|publisher=Philips Research|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref> In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/1985/05/compact-discs-sound-of-the-future/|title=Compact Discs: Sound of the Future|first=Edward|last=Rasen|work=Spin|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref> The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between [[Philips]] and [[Sony]], who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware. The unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company, and allowed the CD to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tx6TYnPat8|title=Introducing the amazing Compact Disc (1982)|date=10 June 2015|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=9 January 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>

[[Heitaro Nakajima]], who developed an early digital audio recorder within Japan's national public broadcasting organization [[NHK]] in 1970, became general manager of [[Sony]]'s audio department in 1971. His team developed a digital [[PCM adaptor]] audio tape recorder using a [[Betamax]] video recorder in 1973.

===First ''Red Book'' CDs and players===
“Red Book” was the first standard in the [[Rainbow Books]] series of standards.

Philips established the Polydor Pressing Operations plant in [[Langenhagen]] near [[Hannover]], [[Germany]], and quickly passed a series of milestones.

* The first ''test pressing'' was of a recording of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[An Alpine Symphony|Eine Alpensinfonie]]'' (''An Alpine Symphony'') played by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and conducted by [[Herbert von Karajan]], who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979.<ref name=\"AutoMR-3\">{{ cite press release |url = http://www.research.philips.com/newscenter/dossier/optrec/firstcds.html | title = Optical Recording | publisher = Royal Philips Electronics }}</ref>
* The first ''public demonstration'' was on the [[BBC]] television program ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' in 1981, when the [[Bee Gees]]' album ''[[Living Eyes (Bee Gees album)|Living Eyes]]'' (1981) was played.<ref name=\"AutoMR-4\">{{cite book| last = Bilyeu|first = Melinda|author2=Hector Cook |author3=Andrew Môn Hughes  |publisher = Omnibus Press| location = |year = 2004| isbn = 978-1-84449-057-8| title = The Bee Gees:tales of the brothers Gibb| page = 519 }}</ref>
* The first ''commercial'' compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982. It was a recording from 1979 of [[Claudio Arrau]] performing Chopin waltzes (Philips 400 025-2). Arrau was invited to the Langenhagen plant to press the start button.
* The first ''popular music'' CD produced at the new factory was ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'' (1981) by [[ABBA]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=7304|title=And 25 Years Ago Philips Introduced the CD|work=GeekZone|accessdate=11 January 2008 }}</ref>
* The first 50 titles were ''released'' in Japan on 1 October 1982, with the first-cataloged CD in this wave being a reissue of [[Billy Joel]]'s ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]''.<ref name=\"AutoMR-6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802133849/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html|archivedate=2 August 2008|title=Sony History: A Great Invention 100 Years On|publisher=[[Sony]]|accessdate=28 February 2012 }}</ref>

The Japanese launch was followed in March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe<ref>[http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_cd.wpd \"Philips celebrates 25th anniversay of the Compact Disc\"], Philips Media Release, 16 August 2007.

The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[audiophile]] communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable [[Walkman]], the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets.

===Further development and decline===
The CD was planned to be the successor of the [[gramophone record]] for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium; but from its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Immink]] and [[Joseph Braat|Braat]] presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention.<ref>{{cite web|title=Experiments Toward an Erasable Compact Disc|url= http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=4492|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> In June 1985, the computer-readable [[CD-ROM]] (read-only memory) and, in 1990, [[CD-R]]ecordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips.<ref name=\"AutoMR-10\">The world's first CD-R was made by the Japanese firm [[Taiyo Yuden]] Co., Ltd. in 1988 as part of the joint Philips-Sony development effort.</ref> Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.

By the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the US to have a factory-equipped cassette player.<ref name=nyt20120718>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/automobiles/06AUDIO.html|title=For Car Cassette Decks, Play Time Is Over|last=Williams|first=Stephen|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012 }}</ref> Currently, with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to USB devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Some CD players incorporate disc changers. Commonly these can hold 3 or 5 discs at once and change from one disc to the next without user intervention. Disc changers capable of holding up to 400 discs at once were available. Also, the user can manually choose the disc to be played, making it similar to a [[jukebox]].

Meanwhile, with the advent and popularity of [[Digital distribution|Internet-based distribution]] of files in [[Lossy compression|lossily-compressed]] [[audio format]]s such as [[MP3]], sales of CDs began to decline in the 2000s. For example, between 2000 and 2008, despite overall growth in music sales and one anomalous year of increase, major-label CD sales declined overall by 20%<ref name=\"AutoMR-11\">{{cite news |first= Ethan|last= Smith|title=Music Sales Decline for Seventh Time in Eight Years: Digital Downloads Can't Offset 20% Plunge in CD Sales |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123075988836646491?mod=rss_whats_news_technology&mg=com-wsj |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=4 March 2009 }}</ref> – although independent and DIY music sales may be tracking better (according to figures released 30 March 2009), and CDs still continue to sell greatly.<ref name=\"AutoMR-12\">{{cite web |url=http://indiemusicstop.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/cd-baby-payouts-surge/ |title=CD Baby Payouts Surge \" Indie Music Stop |publisher=Indiemusicstop.wordpress.com |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718100639/http://indiemusicstop.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/cd-baby-payouts-surge/ |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}</ref>  As of 2012, CDs and DVDs made up only 34 percent of music sales in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyotimes.com/buying-cds-continues-to-be-a-tradition-in-japan/|title=Buying CDs continues to be a tradition in Japan - Tokyo Times|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>  In Japan, however, over 80 percent of music was bought on CDs and other physical formats as of 2015.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sisaro, Ben|title=Music Streaming Service Aims at Japan, Where CD Is Still King|work=New York Times|date=11 June 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/business/media/line-music-a-new-streaming-service-aims-at-japanese-market.html}}</ref>. As of 2020, compact cassettes, vinyl records, and CDs are still being released by some musicians, primarily as merchandise, to allow fans to provide financial support while receiving something tangible in return.

==Inner workings==
The process of playing an audio CD, touted as a digital audio storage medium, starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc, a medium that contains the digitally encoded data. The disc is placed in a tray which either opens up (as with portable CD players) or slides out (the norm with in-home CD players, computer disc drives and game consoles). In some systems, the user slides the disc into a slot (e.g., car stereo CD players). Once the disc is loaded into the tray, the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a [[laser]] beam. An electric motor spins the disc. The tracking control is done by analogue servoamplifiers and then the high frequency analogue signal read from the disc is digitized, processed and decoded into analogue audio and digital control data which is used by the player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track, time, index and, on newer players in the 2010s, display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel.<ref>ISO/IEC Standard 60908</ref>

===Analogue signal recovery from the disc===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Philips RAFOC CD Optical tracking device..png|thumb|Photodiode array on the Philips RAFOC single-beam tracking optical device used in many CDM optical assemblies]]
To read the data from the disc, a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc. Surface differences between discs being played, and tiny position differences once loaded, are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc. A low mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] wide data track.

When the player tries to read from a stop, it first does a focus seek program that moves the lens up and down from the surface of the disc until a reflection is detected; when there is a reflection, the servo electronics lock in place keeping the lens in perfect focus while the disc rotates and changes its relative height from the optical block.

Different brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection. On most players, the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes. The photodiode block and the optics are arranged in such a way that a perfect focus projects a circular pattern on the block while a far or near focus projects an ellipse differing in the position of the long edge in north-south or west-southwest. That difference is the information that the servoamplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation, even if the disc is warped.<ref>Egon Strauss - Compact Disc, Digital storage medium, Ed. Quark 1998</ref>

Another servo mechanism in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track.

Two optical pick-up designs exists, the original CDM series from Philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking. Using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block, the servo knows if the track is centred by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the centre.

The other design by Sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams. When focused, the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few [[micrometre|micrometer]]s apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four. The servo detects the RF signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track. The tracking signal is fed to two systems, one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps.

The sum of the output from the four photodiodes makes the RF or high frequency signal which is an electronic mirror of the pits and lands recorded on the disc. The RF signal, when observed on an oscilloscope, has a characteristic \"fish-eye\" pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems, and calibrating CD players for operation.

===Digital signal processing===
The first stage in the processing chain for the analog RF signal (from the photoreceptor device) is digitizing it. Using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer, the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values, 1 and 0. This signal carries all the information in a CD and is modulated using a system called [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFM]] (Eight-to-fourteen modulation). The second stage is demodulating the EFM signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples, error correction parity bits, according with the [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|CIRC]] error correction code, and control data for the player display and micro-computer.
The EFM demodulator also decodes part of the CD signal and routes it to the proper circuits, separating audio, parity and control (subcode) data.

After demodulating, a CIRC error corrector takes each audio data frame, stores it in a [[Shadow Random Access Memory|SRAM]] memory and verifies that it has been read correctly, if it is not, it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data, then it moves it out to a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] to be converted to an analog audio signal. If the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible, the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed. Each player has a different interpolation ability. If too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable, the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation, so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the DAC to avoid invalid data to be played back.

The Redbook standard dictates that, if there is invalid, erroneous or missing audio data, it cannot be output to the speakers as digital noise, it has to be muted.

===Player control===
The Audio CD format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the CD data; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs do not work by themselves, however; they require a main microcomputer or [[microcontroller]] to orchestrate the entire machine.

==Tray design types==

===Tray loading===
[[File:Vintagedenon.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1980s-era [[Denon]] CD player with the chassis cover removed to show the electronic and mechanical components.]]

[[Sony]] released its [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]] CD player<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/history/sony-dp-101.html | title = CDP-101 The first Compact Disc Audio CD Player from 1982 | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> in 1982 with a slide-out tray design for the CD. As it was easy to manufacture and to use, most CD player manufacturers stayed with the tray style ever since. However, there have been some notable exceptions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.niji.or.jp/home/k-nisi/pd-t09-mecha2.jpg | title = Pioneer \"Stable Platter Mechanism\" | language = | accessdate = | year = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.audioscope.net/images/pioneerpd97002.jpg | title = Pioneer \"Stable Platter Mechanism\" | language = | accessdate = | year = }}</ref>

===Vertical loading===
During the launch of the first prototype \"Goronta\" CD player<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html |title=Sony History |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130231112/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html |archivedate=2006-11-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> by [[Sony]] at the Japanese Audio Fair in 1982, Sony showcased the vertical loading design. Although the Sony prototype design was never put into volume production, the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early Japanese CD player manufacturers, including [[Luxman|Alpine/Luxman]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] under the [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] brand, [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]] and [[Toshiba|Toshiba/Aurex]]. For the early vertical loading players, Alpine sourced their AD-7100 player designs for Luxman,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thevintageknob.org/DAD/DX104/DX104.html | title = Luxman DX-104 CD Player | language = | accessdate = 2007-02-17 | year = 2007}}</ref> Kenwood and Toshiba (using their Aurex brand). Kenwood added their \"Sigma Drive\" outputs to this design as a modification. A picture of this early design can be seen on the Panasonic Web site.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://panasonic.net/history/corporate/products/inp1982.html | title = Panasonic History - Innovative Products - 1982 - CD Player | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006075040/http://panasonic.net/history/corporate/products/inp1982.html | archive-date = 2008-10-06 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The vertical loading is similar the one common in [[cassette deck]]s, where the holder opens, and disc is dropped to it. The holder is closed manually by hand, by motor after pressing a button, or completely automatically. Some CD players combine vertical loading with slot loading due the disc being drawn further into the disc holder as it closes.

===Top loading===
[[File:Philips CD 100.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Philips CD100 Player]]

In 1983 [[Philips]], at the US and European launch of the CD format, showcased the first top loading CD tray designs with their CD100 CD player.<ref>[http://www.marantzphilips.nl/philips_cd100_first_cdplayer/ Philips CD100 Player\"] - Marantz-Philips Nederlands website</ref><ref>[http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/introduction.html \"The history of the CD - The introduction\"], Philips Research.</ref> (Philips audio products were sold as [[Magnavox]] in the US at the time.) The design had a clamp on the lid which meant the user had to close this over the CD when it was placed inside the machine. Later, [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]] introduced their MCD \"high end\" CD player,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |title=Meridian CD History |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204043147/http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |archivedate=2007-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with Meridian electronics in the Philips CD100 chassis.

Top-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable CD players, but among stereo component CD players, only a handful of top-loading models have been made. Examples include [[Luxman]]'s D-500 and D-500X series<ref>{{cite web | url = http://k-nisi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/d-500-xs.html | title = Luxman D-500X (in Japanese) | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070717004455/http://k-nisi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/d-500-xs.html | archive-date = 2007-07-17 | url-status = dead }}</ref> players and [[Denon]]'s DP-S1,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://denon.jp/museum/products/dps1.html | title = Denon Museum - Model History - 1993 - DP-S1 (in Japanese) | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204103139/http://denon.jp/museum/products/dps1.html | archive-date = 2007-02-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref> both launched in 1993.
Top-loading is also common in players intended for broadcast and live sound \"DJ\" use, such as Technics' SL-P50 (1984–1985) and Technics SL-P1200 (1986–1992). They more closely mimic the physical arrangement and ergonomics of record turntables used in those applications.

===Tray loading with sliding mechanism===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
The Philips CD303 of 1983-1984 was the first player to adopt tray loading with a sliding play mechanism. Basically as the tray came out to collect the CD, the entire player's transport system also came out as one unit. The [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]]s 200 and 203 players were of this type. They were also the first to use a design in which the audio electronics were in a separate enclosure from the CD drive and pickup mechanism. A similar mechanism is used in slim optical disc drives (also known as slim internal DVD drive, optical drive or DVD burner),  which were once commonly used in laptop computers.

===Slot loading===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Slot loading is the preferred loading mechanism for car audio players. There is no tray that pops out, and a motor is used to assist disc insertion and removal. Some slot-loading mechanisms and changers can load and play back [[Mini CD|Mini-CDs]] without the need of an adapter but they may work with limited functionality (A disc changer will refuse to operate the changer until the Mini CD is removed for example).
[[Shaped Compact Disc|Non-circular CDs]] cannot be used on such loaders because they cannot handle non-circular discs. When inserted, such discs may become stuck and damage the mechanism. It is also used on some laptop computers, the [[PlayStation 3 models|Playstation 3 original and Playstation 3 Slim]], all variants of the [[PlayStation 4]], in the [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]], and in the [[Xbox One]].

==Pickup mechanisms==
[[File:Optical Deck Bottom.jpg|thumb|left|Underside view showing a radial-type tracking mechanism with screw drive]]
[[File:Philips CDM4 Swing Arm CD mechanism.jpg|thumb|Philips swing arm optical mechanism]]
[[File:cdchip.jpg|thumb|The optical chip extracted from a CD player. The three dark rectangles are photosensitive, read the data from the disk and keep the beam focused. Electronic tracking, aided with the two photodiodes at the sides, keeps the laser beam centered on the middle of the data track.]]
Two types of optical tracking mechanisms exist:
* The '''swing-arm mechanism''', originally designed by Philips<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siber-sonic.com/audio/swingarm.html |title=Swing-arm mechanism description |publisher=Siber-sonic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>&nbsp;– the lens moves at the end of an arm, in a manner similar to the tone arm assembly of a [[Phonograph|record player]]. Used in earliest Philips CD players and later replaced with cheaper radial mechanisms.
* The '''radial mechanism''', designed by Sony, which is the one used in most CD players in the 2000s – the lens moves on a radial rail being driven by a rotating gear from a motor or a linear magnetic assembly. The motor or linear magnetic assembly consists of a solenoid mounted to the moving laser assembly, wound over a permanent magnetic field attached to the base of the mechanism. It is also known as three-beam linear tracking.
[[File:Philips 1 beam tracking Laser Optical Assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Philips one-beam laser assembly]]
The swing-arm mechanism has a distinctive advantage over the other in that it does not \"skip\" when the rail becomes dirty. The swing arm mechanisms tend to have a much longer life than their radial counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The main difference between the two mechanisms is the way they read the data from the disc. The swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a [[hard drive]] moves its head across the data tracks. It also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface. By operating the tracking or the focus actuators, the laser beam can be positioned on any part of the disc.
This mechanism employs a single laser beam and a set of four photodiodes to read, focus and keep track of the data coming from the disc.<ref>Philips CD100 Service Manual</ref>

[[File:CD Player focusing lens assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp laser optical assembly. All six focusing and tracking coils can be seen.]]
The linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field. One set of two coils moves the lens closer to the disc surface, providing the focusing motion, and the other set of coils moves the lens radially, providing a finer tracking motion. This mechanism uses the three-beam tracking method in which a main laser beam is used to read and focus the data track of the disc using three or four photodiodes, depending on the focus method, and two smaller beams read the adjacent tracks at each side to help the servo keep the tracking using two more \"helper\" [[photodiode]]s.<ref>Sony CDP-101 Service Manual</ref>

==Mechanical components==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Dismantled Philips EXP2582 portable CD player.jpg|thumb|[[Philips]] Portable CD player disassembled]]
A CD player has three major mechanical components : a '''drive motor''', a '''[[lens (optics)|lens]] system''' or pickup head, and a '''tracking mechanism'''.
The drive motor (also called spindle) spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2–1.4&nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]]) – equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.) The tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a [[laser beam]], typically produced by a [[laser diode]]. The laser reads information by focusing a beam on the CD, which is reflected off the disc's mirrored surface back to a [[photodiode]] array sensor. The sensor detects changes in the beam, and a digital processing chain interprets these changes as binary data. The data are processed, and eventually converted to [[sound]] using a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC).

A TOC or Table of Contents is located after the \"lead-in\" area of the disc, which is located in an inner ring of the disc, and contains roughly five kilobytes of available space. It is the first information that the player reads when the disc is loaded in the player and contains information on the total number of audio tracks, the running time on the CD, the running time of each track, and other information such as ISRC and the format structure of the disc. The TOC is of such vital importance for the disc that if it is not read correctly by the player, the CD could not be played back. That is why it is repeated 3 times before the first music program starts. The \"lead out\" area in the end (the outer peripheral) of the disc tells the player that disc has come to an end.

==CD player features==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
CD players can employ a number of ways to improve performance, or reduce component count or price. Features such as oversampling, one-bit DACs, dual DACs, interpolation (error correction), anti-skip buffering, digital and optical outputs are, or were, likely to be found. Other features improve functionality, such as track programming, random play and repeat, or direct track access. Yet others are related to the CD player's intended target, such as anti-skip for car and portable CD players, pitch control and queuing for a DJ's CD player, remote and system integration for household players. Description of some features follows:

*''[[Oversampling]]'' is a way to improve the performance of the low pass filter present at the output of most CD players. By using a higher sampling frequency, a multiple of the 44.1&nbsp;kHz used by CD encoding, it can employ a filter with much lower requirements.
*''[[Delta-sigma modulation#Digital to analog conversion|One-bit DACs]]'' were less expensive than other types of DACs, while providing similar performance.
*''Dual DACs'' were sometimes advertised as a feature because some of the early CD players used a single DAC, and switched it between channels. This required additional supporting circuits, possibly degrading sound quality.
*''Anti-skip or Antishock'', is a way for the CD player to avoid interrupting the audio output when mechanical shock is experienced by the disc playback mechanism. It consists of an additional data processor and a [[RAM chip]] installed on the player that reads the disc at double speed and stores various frames of audio data in a RAM [[memory buffer]] for later decoding. Some players may compress the audio data prior to buffering to use lower capacity (and less expensive) RAM chips. Typical players can store about 44 seconds of audio data on a 16 mbit RAM chip.

==Portable CD players==

===Small portable players===
[[File:Discman D121.jpg|thumb|upright|An early portable player, a [[Sony]] [[Discman]] model D-121]]
A [[portable CD player]] is a [[portable audio player]] used to play [[compact disc]]s. Portable CD players are powered by batteries and they have a 1/8\" headphone jack into which the user plugs a pair of [[headphone]]s. The first portable CD player released was the [[Discman|D-50]] by [[Sony]].<ref name=\"aye\">Lungu, R. [http://gadgets.softpedia.com/news/History-of-the-Portable-Audio-Player-046-01.html \"History of the Portable Audio Player.\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502104636/http://gadgets.softpedia.com/news/History-of-the-Portable-Audio-Player-046-01.html |date=May 2, 2012 }} 2008-11-27.</ref> The D-50 was made available on the market in 1984,<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199907/99-059/ | title = Sony Celebrates Walkman 20th Anniversary | publisher = Sony Press Release | accessdate = 2009-05-04}}</ref> and adopted for Sony's entire portable [[Compact Disc|CD]] player line.

In 1998, portable [[MP3 player]]s began to compete with portable CD players.  After [[Apple Computer]] entered the music player market with its [[iPod]] line, within ten years it became the dominant seller of portable [[digital audio]] players, \"...while former giant [[Sony]] (maker of the [portable] [[Walkman]] and [CD] [[Discman]] [was] struggling.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Dyer |first1=Jeffrey H. |last2=Godfrey |first2=Paul|last3=Jensen |first3= Robert|last4=Bryce |first4= David|date=2005 |title= Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases|url= |location= |publisher=Wiley Global Edition |page= 5|isbn=}}</ref> This market shift was initiated when the first portable digital audio player, the [[Rio digital music player]], was introduced.

In the 2000s, users can \"carry [their] entire music collection in a [digital audio] player the size of a cigarette package.\"<ref name=\"Fries 2005 112–113\"/> The 4 GB iPod, for example, holds over 1,000 songs.<ref name=\"Fries 2005 112–113\"/>

===Boomboxes===
[[File:Sony Boombox circa 2005.JPG|thumb|right|A Sony CD boombox from 2005]]
A [[boombox]] is a common term for a portable [[cassette player|cassette]] and AM/FM radio that consists of an amplifier, two or more [[loudspeaker]]s and a carrying handle. Beginning in the 1990s, boomboxes typically included a CD player. The boombox CD player is the only type of CD player which produces sound audible by the listener independently, without the need for [[headphones]] or an additional amplifier or speaker system. Designed for portability, boomboxes can be powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] as well as by line current. The boombox was introduced to the American market during the mid-1970s. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes; by the 1980s, some boomboxes had reached the size of a [[suitcase]]. Most boomboxes were battery-operated, leading to extremely heavy, bulky boxes.<ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2009/04/22/103363836/a-eulogy-for-the-boombox|title=A Eulogy For The Boombox|date=22 April 2009|work=NPR.org|first=Frannie|last=Kelly|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>

Most boomboxes from the 2010s typically include a CD player compatible with [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]], which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium. Many also permit iPod and similar devices to be plugged into them through one or more auxiliary ports. Some also support formats such as [[MP3]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. Another modern variant is a DVD player/boombox with a top-loading CD/[[DVD]] drive and an [[LCD]] video screen in the position once occupied by a cassette deck.<ref>{{cite news | last =

==DJ equipment==
[[File:Behringer VMX-200 DJ mixer + Denon DN-2500F dual CD player + RC-44 remote controller.jpg|thumb|right|upright|This example of a CD player used by DJs is the Denon DN-2500 dual CD player, on the right side of the picture. A Behringer VMX-200 [[DJ mixer]] is also shown in the left side, in the foreground.]]
[[Disc jockey]]s (DJs) who are playing a mix of [[song]]s at a [[dance club]], [[rave]], or [[nightclub]] create their dance mixes by having songs playing on two or more sound sources and using a [[DJ mixer]] to transition seamlessly between songs. In the 1970s [[disco]] era, DJs typically used two [[phonograph|record players]].<ref>Katz, Mark. ''Capturing Sound: How Technology Has Changed Music''. University of California Press, 2010. p. 127</ref> From the 1980s to the 1990s, two [[compact cassette]] players became a popular sound source for DJs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playlistresearch.com/djmixing.htm|title=Art and History of DJ Mixing by Alex Cosper|website=www.playlistresearch.com|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> In subsequent decades, DJs shifted to CDs and then to [[digital audio player]]s. DJs who use CDs and CD players typically use specialized DJ CD players that have features not available on regular CD players.

DJs who are performing \"[[scratching]]\"–the creation of rhythmic sounds and sound effects from sound recordings–traditionally used [[vinyl record]]s and [[phonograph|turntables]]. In the 2010s, some specialized DJ CD players can be used to create the same \"scratching\" effects using songs on CDs.

A '''CD player''' is an electronic device that plays audio [[compact disc]]s, which are a [[digital audio|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|data storage]] format. CD players were first sold to consumers in 1982. CDs typically contain recordings of audio material such as music or [[audiobook]]s. CD players may be part of home [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] systems, [[car audio]] systems, [[personal computer]]s, or [[portable CD player]]s such as CD [[boombox]]es. Most CD players produce an output signal via a [[headphone]] jack or [[RCA jack]]s. To use a CD player in a home stereo system, the user connects an RCA cable from the RCA jacks to a [[hi-fi]] (or other [[power amplifier|amplifier]]) and [[loudspeaker]]s for listening to music.  To listen to music using a CD player with a headphone output jack, the user plugs headphones or earphones into the headphone jack. 

Modern units can play audio formats other than the original CD [[Pulse Code Modulation|PCM]] audio coding, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. [[DJ]]s playing [[dance music]] at clubs often use specialized players with an adjustable playback speed to alter the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and tempo of the music. [[Audio engineer]]s using CD players to play music for an event through a [[sound reinforcement system]] use professional audio-grade CD players. CD playback functionality is also available on CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive equipped computers as well as on [[DVD player]]s and most optical disc-based [[game console]]s.

The Compact Disc is an evolution of [[LaserDisc]] technology, where a focused [[laser]] beam
is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals.
Prototypes were developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] independently in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of the CD|url=http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/|publisher=Philips Research|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref> In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/1985/05/compact-discs-sound-of-the-future/|title=Compact Discs: Sound of the Future|first=Edward|last=Rasen|work=Spin|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref> The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between [[Philips]] and [[Sony]], who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware. The unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company, and allowed the CD to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tx6TYnPat8|title=Introducing the amazing Compact Disc (1982)|date=10 June 2015|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=9 January 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>

===First ''Red Book'' CDs and players===
“Red Book” was the first standard in the [[Rainbow Books]] series of standards.

Philips established the Polydor Pressing Operations plant in [[Langenhagen]] near [[Hannover]], [[Germany]], and quickly passed a series of milestones.

* The first ''test pressing'' was of a recording of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[An Alpine Symphony|Eine Alpensinfonie]]'' (''An Alpine Symphony'') played by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and conducted by [[Herbert von Karajan]], who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979.<ref name=\"AutoMR-3\">{{ cite press release |url = http://www.research.philips.com/newscenter/dossier/optrec/firstcds.html | title = Optical Recording | publisher = Royal Philips Electronics }}</ref>
* The first ''public demonstration'' was on the [[BBC]] television program ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' in 1981, when the [[Bee Gees]]' album ''[[Living Eyes (Bee Gees album)|Living Eyes]]'' (1981) was played.<ref name=\"AutoMR-4\">{{cite book| last = Bilyeu|first = Melinda|author2=Hector Cook |author3=Andrew Môn Hughes  |publisher = Omnibus Press| location = |year = 2004| isbn = 978-1-84449-057-8| title = The Bee Gees:tales of the brothers Gibb| page = 519 }}</ref>
* The first ''commercial'' compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982. It was a recording from 1979 of [[Claudio Arrau]] performing Chopin waltzes (Philips 400 025-2). Arrau was invited to the Langenhagen plant to press the start button.
* The first ''popular music'' CD produced at the new factory was ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'' (1981) by [[ABBA]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=7304|title=And 25 Years Ago Philips Introduced the CD|work=GeekZone|accessdate=11 January 2008 }}</ref>
* The first 50 titles were ''released'' in Japan on 1 October 1982, with the first-cataloged CD in this wave being a reissue of [[Billy Joel]]'s ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]''.<ref name=\"AutoMR-6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802133849/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html|archivedate=2 August 2008|title=Sony History: A Great Invention 100 Years On|publisher=[[Sony]]|accessdate=28 February 2012 }}</ref>

The Japanese launch was followed in March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe<ref>[http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_cd.wpd \"Philips celebrates 25th anniversay of the Compact Disc\"], Philips Media Release, 16 August 2007.

The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[audiophile]] communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable [[Walkman]], the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets.

===Further development and decline===
The CD was planned to be the successor of the [[gramophone record]] for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium; but from its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Immink]] and [[Joseph Braat|Braat]] presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention.<ref>{{cite web|title=Experiments Toward an Erasable Compact Disc|url= http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=4492|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> In June 1985, the computer-readable [[CD-ROM]] (read-only memory) and, in 1990, [[CD-R]]ecordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips.<ref name=\"AutoMR-10\">The world's first CD-R was made by the Japanese firm [[Taiyo Yuden]] Co., Ltd. in 1988 as part of the joint Philips-Sony development effort.</ref> Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.

By the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the US to have a factory-equipped cassette player.<ref name=nyt20120718>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/automobiles/06AUDIO.html|title=For Car Cassette Decks, Play Time Is Over|last=Williams|first=Stephen|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012 }}</ref> Currently, with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to USB devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Some CD players incorporate disc changers. Commonly these can hold 3 or 5 discs at once and change from one disc to the next without user intervention. Disc changers capable of holding up to 400 discs at once were available. Also, the user can manually choose the disc to be played, making it similar to a [[jukebox]].

Meanwhile, with the advent and popularity of [[Digital distribution|Internet-based distribution]] of files in [[Lossy compression|lossily-compressed]] [[audio format]]s such as [[MP3]], sales of CDs began to decline in the 2000s. For example, between 2000 and 2008, despite overall growth in music sales and one anomalous year of increase, major-label CD sales declined overall by 20%<ref name=\"AutoMR-11\">{{cite news |first= Ethan|last= Smith|title=Music Sales Decline for Seventh Time in Eight Years: Digital Downloads Can't Offset 20% Plunge in CD Sales |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123075988836646491?mod=rss_whats_news_technology&mg=com-wsj |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=4 March 2009 }}</ref> – although independent and DIY music sales may be tracking better (according to figures released 30 March 2009), and CDs still continue to sell greatly.<ref name=\"AutoMR-12\">{{cite web |url=http://indiemusicstop.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/cd-baby-payouts-surge/ |title=CD Baby Payouts Surge \" Indie Music Stop |publisher=Indiemusicstop.wordpress.com |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718100639/http://indiemusicstop.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/cd-baby-payouts-surge/ |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}</ref>  As of 2012, CDs and DVDs made up only 34 percent of music sales in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyotimes.com/buying-cds-continues-to-be-a-tradition-in-japan/|title=Buying CDs continues to be a tradition in Japan - Tokyo Times|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>  In Japan, however, over 80 percent of music was bought on CDs and other physical formats as of 2015.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sisaro, Ben|title=Music Streaming Service Aims at Japan, Where CD Is Still King|work=New York Times|date=11 June 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/business/media/line-music-a-new-streaming-service-aims-at-japanese-market.html}}</ref>. As of 2020, compact cassettes, vinyl records, and CDs are still being released by some musicians, primarily as merchandise, to allow fans to provide financial support while receiving something tangible in return.

==Inner workings==
The process of playing an audio CD, touted as a digital audio storage medium, starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc, a medium that contains the digitally encoded data. The disc is placed in a tray which either opens up (as with portable CD players) or slides out (the norm with in-home CD players, computer disc drives and game consoles). In some systems, the user slides the disc into a slot (e.g., car stereo CD players). Once the disc is loaded into the tray, the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a [[laser]] beam. An electric motor spins the disc. The tracking control is done by analogue servoamplifiers and then the high frequency analogue signal read from the disc is digitized, processed and decoded into analogue audio and digital control data which is used by the player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track, time, index and, on newer players in the 2010s, display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel.<ref>ISO/IEC Standard 60908</ref>

===Analogue signal recovery from the disc===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Philips RAFOC CD Optical tracking device..png|thumb|Photodiode array on the Philips RAFOC single-beam tracking optical device used in many CDM optical assemblies]]
To read the data from the disc, a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc. Surface differences between discs being played, and tiny position differences once loaded, are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc. A low mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] wide data track.

When the player tries to read from a stop, it first does a focus seek program that moves the lens up and down from the surface of the disc until a reflection is detected; when there is a reflection, the servo electronics lock in place keeping the lens in perfect focus while the disc rotates and changes its relative height from the optical block.

Different brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection. On most players, the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes. The photodiode block and the optics are arranged in such a way that a perfect focus projects a circular pattern on the block while a far or near focus projects an ellipse differing in the position of the long edge in north-south or west-southwest. That difference is the information that the servoamplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation, even if the disc is warped.<ref>Egon Strauss - Compact Disc, Digital storage medium, Ed. Quark 1998</ref>

Another servo mechanism in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track.

Two optical pick-up designs exists, the original CDM series from Philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking. Using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block, the servo knows if the track is centred by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the centre.

The other design by Sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams. When focused, the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few [[micrometre|micrometer]]s apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four. The servo detects the RF signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track. The tracking signal is fed to two systems, one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps.

The sum of the output from the four photodiodes makes the RF or high frequency signal which is an electronic mirror of the pits and lands recorded on the disc. The RF signal, when observed on an oscilloscope, has a characteristic \"fish-eye\" pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems, and calibrating CD players for operation.

===Digital signal processing===
The first stage in the processing chain for the analog RF signal (from the photoreceptor device) is digitizing it. Using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer, the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values, 1 and 0. This signal carries all the information in a CD and is modulated using a system called [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFM]] (Eight-to-fourteen modulation). The second stage is demodulating the EFM signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples, error correction parity bits, according with the [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|CIRC]] error correction code, and control data for the player display and micro-computer.
The EFM demodulator also decodes part of the CD signal and routes it to the proper circuits, separating audio, parity and control (subcode) data.

After demodulating, a CIRC error corrector takes each audio data frame, stores it in a [[Shadow Random Access Memory|SRAM]] memory and verifies that it has been read correctly, if it is not, it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data, then it moves it out to a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] to be converted to an analog audio signal. If the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible, the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed. Each player has a different interpolation ability. If too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable, the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation, so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the DAC to avoid invalid data to be played back.

The Redbook standard dictates that, if there is invalid, erroneous or missing audio data, it cannot be output to the speakers as digital noise, it has to be muted.

===Player control===
The Audio CD format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the CD data; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs do not work by themselves, however; they require a main microcomputer or [[microcontroller]] to orchestrate the entire machine.

==Tray design types==

===Tray loading===
[[File:Vintagedenon.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1980s-era [[Denon]] CD player with the chassis cover removed to show the electronic and mechanical components.]]

[[Sony]] released its [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]] CD player<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/history/sony-dp-101.html | title = CDP-101 The first Compact Disc Audio CD Player from 1982 | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> in 1982 with a slide-out tray design for the CD. As it was easy to manufacture and to use, most CD player manufacturers stayed with the tray style ever since. However, there have been some notable exceptions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.niji.or.jp/home/k-nisi/pd-t09-mecha2.jpg | title = Pioneer \"Stable Platter Mechanism\" | language = | accessdate = | year = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.audioscope.net/images/pioneerpd97002.jpg | title = Pioneer \"Stable Platter Mechanism\" | language = | accessdate = | year = }}</ref>

===Vertical loading===
During the launch of the first prototype \"Goronta\" CD player<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html |title=Sony History |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130231112/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html |archivedate=2006-11-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> by [[Sony]] at the Japanese Audio Fair in 1982, Sony showcased the vertical loading design. Although the Sony prototype design was never put into volume production, the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early Japanese CD player manufacturers, including [[Luxman|Alpine/Luxman]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] under the [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] brand, [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]] and [[Toshiba|Toshiba/Aurex]]. For the early vertical loading players, Alpine sourced their AD-7100 player designs for Luxman,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thevintageknob.org/DAD/DX104/DX104.html | title = Luxman DX-104 CD Player | language = | accessdate = 2007-02-17 | year = 2007}}</ref> Kenwood and Toshiba (using their Aurex brand). Kenwood added their \"Sigma Drive\" outputs to this design as a modification. A picture of this early design can be seen on the Panasonic Web site.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://panasonic.net/history/corporate/products/inp1982.html | title = Panasonic History - Innovative Products - 1982 - CD Player | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006075040/http://panasonic.net/history/corporate/products/inp1982.html | archive-date = 2008-10-06 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The vertical loading is similar the one common in [[cassette deck]]s, where the holder opens, and disc is dropped to it. The holder is closed manually by hand, by motor after pressing a button, or completely automatically. Some CD players combine vertical loading with slot loading due the disc being drawn further into the disc holder as it closes.

===Top loading===
[[File:Philips CD 100.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Philips CD100 Player]]

In 1983 [[Philips]], at the US and European launch of the CD format, showcased the first top loading CD tray designs with their CD100 CD player.<ref>[http://www.marantzphilips.nl/philips_cd100_first_cdplayer/ Philips CD100 Player\"] - Marantz-Philips Nederlands website</ref><ref>[http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/introduction.html \"The history of the CD - The introduction\"], Philips Research.</ref> (Philips audio products were sold as [[Magnavox]] in the US at the time.) The design had a clamp on the lid which meant the user had to close this over the CD when it was placed inside the machine. Later, [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]] introduced their MCD \"high end\" CD player,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |title=Meridian CD History |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204043147/http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |archivedate=2007-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with Meridian electronics in the Philips CD100 chassis.

Top-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable CD players, but among stereo component CD players, only a handful of top-loading models have been made. Examples include [[Luxman]]'s D-500 and D-500X series<ref>{{cite web | url = http://k-nisi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/d-500-xs.html | title = Luxman D-500X (in Japanese) | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070717004455/http://k-nisi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/d-500-xs.html | archive-date = 2007-07-17 | url-status = dead }}</ref> players and [[Denon]]'s DP-S1,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://denon.jp/museum/products/dps1.html | title = Denon Museum - Model History - 1993 - DP-S1 (in Japanese) | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204103139/http://denon.jp/museum/products/dps1.html | archive-date = 2007-02-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref> both launched in 1993.
Top-loading is also common in players intended for broadcast and live sound \"DJ\" use, such as Technics' SL-P50 (1984–1985) and Technics SL-P1200 (1986–1992). They more closely mimic the physical arrangement and ergonomics of record turntables used in those applications.

===Tray loading with sliding mechanism===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
The Philips CD303 of 1983-1984 was the first player to adopt tray loading with a sliding play mechanism. Basically as the tray came out to collect the CD, the entire player's transport system also came out as one unit. The [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]]s 200 and 203 players were of this type. They were also the first to use a design in which the audio electronics were in a separate enclosure from the CD drive and pickup mechanism. A similar mechanism is used in slim optical disc drives (also known as slim internal DVD drive, optical drive or DVD burner),  which were once commonly used in laptop computers.

===Slot loading===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Slot loading is the preferred loading mechanism for car audio players. There is no tray that pops out, and a motor is used to assist disc insertion and removal. Some slot-loading mechanisms and changers can load and play back [[Mini CD|Mini-CDs]] without the need of an adapter but they may work with limited functionality (A disc changer will refuse to operate the changer until the Mini CD is removed for example).
[[Shaped Compact Disc|Non-circular CDs]] cannot be used on such loaders because they cannot handle non-circular discs. When inserted, such discs may become stuck and damage the mechanism. It is also used on some laptop computers, the [[PlayStation 3 models|Playstation 3 original and Playstation 3 Slim]], all variants of the [[Playstation 4]], in the [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]], and in the [[Xbox One]].

==Pickup mechanisms==
[[File:Optical Deck Bottom.jpg|thumb|left|Underside view showing a radial-type tracking mechanism with screw drive]]
[[File:Philips CDM4 Swing Arm CD mechanism.jpg|thumb|Philips swing arm optical mechanism]]
[[File:cdchip.jpg|thumb|The optical chip extracted from a CD player. The three dark rectangles are photosensitive, read the data from the disk and keep the beam focused. Electronic tracking, aided with the two photodiodes at the sides, keeps the laser beam centered on the middle of the data track.]]
Two types of optical tracking mechanisms exist:
* The '''swing-arm mechanism''', originally designed by Philips<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siber-sonic.com/audio/swingarm.html |title=Swing-arm mechanism description |publisher=Siber-sonic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>&nbsp;– the lens moves at the end of an arm, in a manner similar to the tone arm assembly of a [[Phonograph|record player]]. Used in earliest Philips CD players and later replaced with cheaper radial mechanisms.
* The '''radial mechanism''', designed by Sony, which is the one used in most CD players in the 2000s – the lens moves on a radial rail being driven by a rotating gear from a motor or a linear magnetic assembly. The motor or linear magnetic assembly consists of a solenoid mounted to the moving laser assembly, wound over a permanent magnetic field attached to the base of the mechanism. It is also known as three-beam linear tracking.
[[File:Philips 1 beam tracking Laser Optical Assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Philips one-beam laser assembly]]
The swing-arm mechanism has a distinctive advantage over the other in that it does not \"skip\" when the rail becomes dirty. The swing arm mechanisms tend to have a much longer life than their radial counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The main difference between the two mechanisms is the way they read the data from the disc. The swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a [[hard drive]] moves its head across the data tracks. It also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface. By operating the tracking or the focus actuators, the laser beam can be positioned on any part of the disc.
This mechanism employs a single laser beam and a set of four photodiodes to read, focus and keep track of the data coming from the disc.<ref>Philips CD100 Service Manual</ref>

[[File:CD Player focusing lens assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp laser optical assembly. All six focusing and tracking coils can be seen.]]
The linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field. One set of two coils moves the lens closer to the disc surface, providing the focusing motion, and the other set of coils moves the lens radially, providing a finer tracking motion. This mechanism uses the three-beam tracking method in which a main laser beam is used to read and focus the data track of the disc using three or four photodiodes, depending on the focus method, and two smaller beams read the adjacent tracks at each side to help the servo keep the tracking using two more \"helper\" [[photodiode]]s.<ref>Sony CDP-101 Service Manual</ref>

==Mechanical components==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Dismantled Philips EXP2582 portable CD player.jpg|thumb|[[Philips]] Portable CD player disassembled]]
A CD player has three major mechanical components : a '''drive motor''', a '''[[lens (optics)|lens]] system''' or pickup head, and a '''tracking mechanism'''.
The drive motor (also called spindle) spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2–1.4&nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]]) – equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.) The tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a [[laser beam]], typically produced by a [[laser diode]]. The laser reads information by focusing a beam on the CD, which is reflected off the disc's mirrored surface back to a [[photodiode]] array sensor. The sensor detects changes in the beam, and a digital processing chain interprets these changes as binary data. The data are processed, and eventually converted to [[sound]] using a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC).

A TOC or Table of Contents is located after the \"lead-in\" area of the disc, which is located in an inner ring of the disc, and contains roughly five kilobytes of available space. It is the first information that the player reads when the disc is loaded in the player and contains information on the total number of audio tracks, the running time on the CD, the running time of each track, and other information such as ISRC and the format structure of the disc. The TOC is of such vital importance for the disc that if it is not read correctly by the player, the CD could not be played back. That is why it is repeated 3 times before the first music program starts. The \"lead out\" area in the end (the outer peripheral) of the disc tells the player that disc has come to an end.

==CD player features==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
CD players can employ a number of ways to improve performance, or reduce component count or price. Features such as oversampling, one-bit DACs, dual DACs, interpolation (error correction), anti-skip buffering, digital and optical outputs are, or were, likely to be found. Other features improve functionality, such as track programming, random play and repeat, or direct track access. Yet others are related to the CD player's intended target, such as anti-skip for car and portable CD players, pitch control and queuing for a DJ's CD player, remote and system integration for household players. Description of some features follows:

*''[[Oversampling]]'' is a way to improve the performance of the low pass filter present at the output of most CD players. By using a higher sampling frequency, a multiple of the 44.1&nbsp;kHz used by CD encoding, it can employ a filter with much lower requirements.
*''[[Delta-sigma modulation#Digital to analog conversion|One-bit DACs]]'' were less expensive than other types of DACs, while providing similar performance.
*''Dual DACs'' were sometimes advertised as a feature because some of the early CD players used a single DAC, and switched it between channels. This required additional supporting circuits, possibly degrading sound quality.
*''Anti-skip or Antishock'', is a way for the CD player to avoid interrupting the audio output when mechanical shock is experienced by the disc playback mechanism. It consists of an additional data processor and a [[RAM chip]] installed on the player that reads the disc at double speed and stores various frames of audio data in a RAM [[memory buffer]] for later decoding. Some players may compress the audio data prior to buffering to use lower capacity (and less expensive) RAM chips. Typical players can store about 44 seconds of audio data on a 16 mbit RAM chip.

==Portable CD players==

===Small portable players===
[[File:Discman D121.jpg|thumb|upright|An early portable player, a [[Sony]] [[Discman]] model D-121]]
A [[portable CD player]] is a [[portable audio player]] used to play [[compact disc]]s. Portable CD players are powered by batteries and they have a 1/8\" headphone jack into which the user plugs a pair of [[headphone]]s. The first portable CD player released was the [[Discman|D-50]] by [[Sony]].<ref name=\"aye\">Lungu, R. [http://gadgets.softpedia.com/news/History-of-the-Portable-Audio-Player-046-01.html \"History of the Portable Audio Player.\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502104636/http://gadgets.softpedia.com/news/History-of-the-Portable-Audio-Player-046-01.html |date=May 2, 2012 }} 2008-11-27.</ref> The D-50 was made available on the market in 1984,<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199907/99-059/ | title = Sony Celebrates Walkman 20th Anniversary | publisher = Sony Press Release | accessdate = 2009-05-04}}</ref> and adopted for Sony's entire portable [[Compact Disc|CD]] player line.

In 1998, portable [[MP3 player]]s began to compete with portable CD players.  After [[Apple Computer]] entered the music player market with its [[iPod]] line, within ten years it became the dominant seller of portable [[digital audio]] players, \"...while former giant [[Sony]] (maker of the [portable] [[Walkman]] and [CD] [[Discman]] [was] struggling.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Dyer |first1=Jeffrey H. |last2=Godfrey |first2=Paul|last3=Jensen |first3= Robert|last4=Bryce |first4= David|date=2005 |title= Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases|url= |location= |publisher=Wiley Global Edition |page= 5|isbn=}}</ref> This market shift was initiated when the first portable digital audio player, the [[Rio digital music player]], was introduced.

In the 2000s, users can \"carry [their] entire music collection in a [digital audio] player the size of a cigarette package.\"<ref name=\"Fries 2005 112–113\"/> The 4 GB iPod, for example, holds over 1,000 songs.<ref name=\"Fries 2005 112–113\"/>

===Boomboxes===
[[File:Sony Boombox circa 2005.JPG|thumb|right|A Sony CD boombox from 2005]]
A [[boombox]] is a common term for a portable [[cassette player|cassette]] and AM/FM radio that consists of an amplifier, two or more [[loudspeaker]]s and a carrying handle. Beginning in the 1990s, boomboxes typically included a CD player. The boombox CD player is the only type of CD player which produces sound audible by the listener independently, without the need for [[headphones]] or an additional amplifier or speaker system. Designed for portability, boomboxes can be powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] as well as by line current. The boombox was introduced to the American market during the mid-1970s. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes; by the 1980s, some boomboxes had reached the size of a [[suitcase]]. Most boomboxes were battery-operated, leading to extremely heavy, bulky boxes.<ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2009/04/22/103363836/a-eulogy-for-the-boombox|title=A Eulogy For The Boombox|date=22 April 2009|work=NPR.org|first=Frannie|last=Kelly|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>

Most boomboxes from the 2010s typically include a CD player compatible with [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]], which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium. Many also permit iPod and similar devices to be plugged into them through one or more auxiliary ports. Some also support formats such as [[MP3]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. Another modern variant is a DVD player/boombox with a top-loading CD/[[DVD]] drive and an [[LCD]] video screen in the position once occupied by a cassette deck.<ref>{{cite news | last =

==DJ equipment==
[[File:Behringer VMX-200 DJ mixer + Denon DN-2500F dual CD player + RC-44 remote controller.jpg|thumb|right|upright|This example of a CD player used by DJs is the Denon DN-2500 dual CD player, on the right side of the picture. A Behringer VMX-200 [[DJ mixer]] is also shown in the left side, in the foreground.]]
[[Disc jockey]]s (DJs) who are playing a mix of [[song]]s at a [[dance club]], [[rave]], or [[nightclub]] create their dance mixes by having songs playing on two or more sound sources and using a [[DJ mixer]] to transition seamlessly between songs. In the 1970s [[disco]] era, DJs typically used two [[phonograph|record players]].<ref>Katz, Mark. ''Capturing Sound: How Technology Has Changed Music''. University of California Press, 2010. p. 127</ref> From the 1980s to the 1990s, two [[compact cassette]] players became a popular sound source for DJs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playlistresearch.com/djmixing.htm|title=Art and History of DJ Mixing by Alex Cosper|website=www.playlistresearch.com|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> In subsequent decades, DJs shifted to CDs and then to [[digital audio player]]s. DJs who use CDs and CD players typically use specialized DJ CD players that have features not available on regular CD players.

DJs who are performing \"[[scratching]]\"–the creation of rhythmic sounds and sound effects from sound recordings–traditionally used [[vinyl record]]s and [[phonograph|turntables]]. In the 2010s, some specialized DJ CD players can be used to create the same \"scratching\" effects using songs on CDs.

In 2010, while growing up in Indonesia, Brian began his career with social media, when he was 11 years old. He had originally gotten his hands on a [[Rubik's Cube]], and he realised he could log onto his parents' computer to find strategies for solving it faster. This is how he discovered [[YouTube]]. He also found and joined [[Twitter]], in August 2010, when he was just 11 years old. This eventually led him to making video content, including [[Black comedy|dark-comedy]] sketches on Twitter.<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> He moved to the platform [[Vine (service)|Vine]] when he was 15 and began to post daily videos there. Brian, who at the time spoke only [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], taught himself to speak English by watching [[YouTube]] videos and by listening to rappers like [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]], [[2 Chainz]], [[Macklemore]] and [[Tyler, the Creator]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mtv.com/artists/rich-chigga/biography/ |title = Rich Chigga Bio – Rich Chigga Career – MTV |last = MTV |accessdate = 4 November 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161105223509/http://www.mtv.com/artists/rich-chigga/biography/ |archive-date = 5 November 2016 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2010, while growing up in Indonesia, Brian began his career with social media, when he was 11 years old. He had originally gotten his hands on a [[Rubik's Cube]], and he realised he could log onto his parents' computer to find strategies for solving it faster. This is how he discovered [[YouTube]]. He also found and joined [[Twitter]], in August 2010, when he was just 11 years old. This eventually led him to making video content, including [[Black comedy|dark-comedy]] sketches on Twitter.<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> He moved to the platform [[Vine (service)|Vine]] when he was 15 and began to post daily videos there. Brian, who at the time spoke only [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], taught himself to speak English by watching [[YouTube]] videos and by listening to rappers like [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]], [[2 Chainz]], [[Macklemore]] and [[Tyler, the Creator]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mtv.com/artists/rich-chigga/biography/ |title = Rich Chigga Bio – Rich Chigga Career – MTV |last = MTV |accessdate = 4 November 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161105223509/http://www.mtv.com/artists/rich-chigga/biography/ |archive-date = 5 November 2016 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The '''Yugo''' ({{IPA-sh|ˈjûɡo|pron}}), also marketed as the '''Zastava Koral''' ({{IPA-sh|ˈzâːstaʋa ˈkǒraːl|pron}}, {{lang-sr-cyr|Застава Корал}}) and '''Yugo Koral''', is a [[subcompact car]] [[hatchback]] formerly manufactured by [[Zastava Automobiles]], at the time a [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] corporation.

Originally designed in Italy, as a shortened variant of the [[Fiat 128]], the first Yugo prototype was manufactured on 2 July 1977. Series production started on 28 November 1980. The Zastava Koral, a facelifted model, was marketed until 11 November 2008, after production of 794,428 cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magazinauto.com/pre-37-godina-sastavljen-je-prvi-jugo/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190119124747/https://www.magazinauto.com/pre-37-godina-sastavljen-je-prvi-jugo/ | archivedate = 2019-01-19 | title=Pre 36 godina sastavljen je prvi serijski Jugo | trans-title = The first Yugo was built 36 years ago | lang = sr | publisher=Auto Magazin |date=29 November 2016}}</ref>

The Yugo was marketed in the [[United States]] from 1985 to 1992 by [[Malcolm Bricklin]], with a total of 141,651 sold – peaking at 48,812 in 1987 and falling to 1,412 in 1992.

The car has been subjected to [[#Criticism and response|much criticism]] over its design and reliability; the historian Jason Vuic has called it \"the worst car in history.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Vuic|first=Jason|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a21082360/a-quick-history-of-the-yugo-the-worst-car-in-history/|title=A Quick Look at the Yugo, the Worst Car in History|date=2018-06-06|work=|access-date=2020-04-13|url-status=live}}</ref>

Yugo 45 derivative models have included the Yugo 55, 60, 65, Koral, Ciao, Tempo, Cabrio, GV, GV Plus, GVX, and GVL. Yugo engines were fitted with a [[carburetor]] until well into the 1980s before fuel-injected models (starting with the Koral 65) were gradually introduced, beginning with the GVX-EFI (an [[electronic fuel injection]] system), which featured a 1300-cc engine. Yugo did not only target the [[Western Bloc|West]]: In early 1985 500 Yugos were exported to China, and exports to Bulgaria and Egypt were already established.<ref name=AGp54>{{cite magazine | ref = AG140 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 140 | volume = 6 | page = 54 | title = Zastava en cie | trans-title = Zastava and company | first = Peter | last = Homola | language = nl-be | date = 1985-02-07 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref>

The fuel-injection system was a Motronic MP3.1, which was later developed with [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] to Motronic M4.6 MPI on 1.1- and 1.3-L engines and had [[Multi Point Injection|multiport fuel injection]] with a three-way [[catalytic converter]] and [[lambda sensor|\"Lambda\" sensor]].<ref>[http://www.zpkg.com/forum1/Koral/Uputstva/Motronic_M4.6_Teorijske_osnove.pdf Motronic MP3.1]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

===Later models===
Near the end of its production run, Zastava sold an updated version of the Yugo Koral model, known as the Zastava Koral IN, which had
[[central locking]],  a three-step rotary switch on the dash marked \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" for a headlamps leveling control in four height positions, a [[loudspeaker|four-speaker]] [[Car audio|audio system]], [[electric window]]s, [[Side-view mirror|folding electro-adjustable side-view mirrors]], alloy wheels, an optional [[Car air conditioning|air conditioner]], and an optional [[Renault]]-designed three-speed [[automatic transmission]]. Zastava sold these in Serbia, [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Greece]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Egypt]].

Besides all the Koral versions available, other models included the Florida and Skala. In October 2003, an agreement with Fiat was reached for production of the [[Fiat Punto]] by Zastava for Eastern European markets, which was known as the [[Zastava 10]].

The Koral IN L, with a [[Peugeot]] fuel-injected 1.1 L-{{convert|60|PS|kW|abbr=on}} engine, met the [[European Union]] safety standards in a test supervised by the German [[Technischer Überwachungsverein]] (Technical Monitoring Association), a necessary step for importation to E.U. countries.

Zastava was founded as an arms manufacturer in 1853. By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into automobile production supplying [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]-designed trucks to the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]. Vehicle production continued until 1941, when [[World War II]] reached Yugoslavia. Following the war, Zastava was permitted to produce Jeeps under license from [[Willys-Overland]] until production was halted in the early 1950s.

The first passenger models were produced on 26 August 1953 using designs licensed by Fiat of [[Turin]]. The first model designed by Zastava was a sedan called the Milletrecento (\"one thousand three hundred\") powered by a 1,300 [[Cubic centimeter|cc]] engine. Some of the most successful models were those based on the [[Fiat 128]] model, marketed under different names: Zastava 101, Zastava 128, Zastava 311, Zastava Skala, etc.

Zastava continued to produce vehicles for the Yugoslav and European markets until exports were limited by sanctions imposed by the [[United Nations]] in the 1990s. In 1984, automobile entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin tested the United States market for Zastava vehicles, now branded as Yugo. As a result, in mid-1986, Yugo America began selling cars at a starting price of $3,990 for the entry-level GV (\"Good Value\") hatchback equipped with the 1,100 cc overhead-cam five-main-bearing engine and four-speed manual transmission. The similar GVL offered a plusher interior, but the sporty top-line GVX was powered by the 1,300 cc engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission, and included as standard equipment a number of deluxe features such as a ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. However, though the GVX was billed as an upscale, sporty version of the base GV, it went from 0-60&nbsp;mph in 13.56 seconds, just a half a second faster than the GV.<ref name=Vuic>{{citation | title = The Yugo: The Rise and Fall of the Worst Car in History | last = Vuic | first = Jason | page = 176 | publisher = Hill and Wang | location = New York City | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8090-9891-0}}</ref> When the political instability in Yugoslavia intensified in early 1992, Zastava was forced to stop exports.

Today, various models are available in the former Yugoslavia, including an agreement signed with Fiat for the production of the 2003 [[Fiat Punto]] model.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://english.eastday.com/eastday/englishedition/business/userobject1ai1474719.html english.eastday.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212130356/http://english.eastday.com/eastday/englishedition/business/userobject1ai1474719.html |date=2006-02-12 }}</ref>

===1988–1991===
[[File:Yugo Police Car.jpg|thumb|A 1990 Yugo police car in [[Croatia]]]]
Many mechanics and even Zastava factory workers agree that the \"best\" Yugos ever were built between 1988 and early 1991. Quality control was good; high standards were set in terms of plastic quality, seat cloth, and \"a well screwed together\" interior. Paint and antirust coatings were also well done during that period, evidenced by many cars still showing no signs of rust, tears in the seats, or major engine issues after more than 20 years.

1989 was considered a \"golden year\" for Yugos because almost 200,000 were built that year, and many can still be seen on the road today. Also, cars were usually branded Yugo instead of Zastava during that period, because the company was taking pride in the (at the time) good sales and reputation established in the export markets, especially in the United States.

In 1990, a batch of 450 cars with automatic transmissions and [[air conditioning]] was shipped to the United States. With political problems starting in 1991, quality dropped significantly, coming to such low standards such as plastic parts of the dashboard not fitting correctly.

===1991–1996===
Because the Yugo was built as a \"Yugoslav\" car with political problems and civil war breaking out in 1990–91, production slowed down and the supply of parts was interrupted. Most of the plastic came from Croatia, while the alternators and electrical equipment came from Slovenia. With the start of civil war, economic and transportation ties were broken, resulting in shortage of most parts coming from the two seceded republics. Though the sanctions were not in place until May 1992, Yugos built between June 1991 and early 1996 were built with a variety of \"leftover\" parts: as an example, getting a car with a blue dashboard and a brown steering wheel, seats that were mismatched in color, and most likely an \"American\" instrument cluster with speeds printed in MPH rather than km/h, and with written labels like water and oil instead of small drawings, and a seatbelt safety warning light were possible. In some extreme cases, the car would come with different interior panels and a steering wheel from other Zastava products such as the Zastava 750. When exports to United States (and the rest of the world) stopped, a number of federalized Yugos were still left in the factory's parking lots, and many people got these \"American\" Yugos instead of the European ones. When Yugoslavia broke apart in the early 1990s, production rates steeply declined to 14,000 in 1992, 7,000 in 1993 and 1994, and 9,000 in 1995. In 1996, when sanctions were lifted, production rates slowly increased as living standards in the former Yugoslavia started to improve. Even so, problems for the factory started once again when it was put out of production in mid-1999 as a result of war with [[NATO]].

===In the United States===
{{refimprove-section|date=February 2020}}

International Automobile Importers (IAI) was a company founded by [[Malcolm Bricklin]] to import the X1/9 and 2000 Spider after Fiat halted their manufacture.<ref>Vuic, p. 21</ref> Bertone and [[Pininfarina]] carried on production under their own names and Bricklin's IAI took over their U.S. importation. Bricklin wanted to import additional brands, and international dealmaker [[Armand Hammer]] had been asked by the Yugoslavs to identify business areas in which they could generate exports to bolster their economy. Hammer thought the idea of exporting the small cars made in [[Kragujevac]], Serbia, by Zavodi Crvena Zastava, would be viable. Zastava had, since the mid-19th century, been a quality armaments producer and sponsored its own museum.

As Zastava celebrated its 100th anniversary, it started producing vehicles made under license from the Italian company Fiat, located just across the [[Adriatic]] Sea. For three decades, Zastava produced the rear-engined 600 and the 101, a bustle-backed version of the [[Fiat 128]]. On its own initiative in 1980, Zastava introduced its Jugo or Yugo model which, though still using Fiat 128-type powertrain and other components, was in fact an update of the Fiat 127{{CN|date=February 2020}} styled in Turin.{{CN|date=February 2020}}. Zastava was already exporting its new offering to other Eastern European markets, installing the bigger 128 overhead-cam engine for a top speed of {{convert|90|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

In 1982, U.S. entrepreneur Miro Kefurt contacted Zastava in Kragujevac (ZCZ-Zavodi Crvena Zastava) with an idea to export the Yugo 45 to the United States.<ref>Vuic, p. 11</ref> The vehicles were to be renamed Yugo GV for the United States market and YugoCars, Inc. was formed in [[Sun Valley, California]], by Kefurt and Ray Burns. The proposal required approval by Fiat in [[Italy]] due to existing contractual restrictions in effect for Fiat—Zastava collaborations.

The first three Yugo vehicles, painted red, white, and blue, were introduced to the U.S. public at the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] in May 1984. The car was promoted with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty, free maintenance, and a price of only $4,500. Front-page articles about the Yugo appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (Business Section), ''[[New York Times]]'', and ''[[The National Enquirer]]''. However, problems soon arose as one car was sent to the [[California Air Resources Board]] for emissions testing, which it badly failed. The Yugo needed lots of reengineering, and with no help forthcoming from Zastava, Kefurt was in a problematic situation.<ref>Vuic, p. 16</ref>

Reportedly, [[Malcolm Bricklin]] attended the Los Angeles Auto Show, and while the show was still in progress, flew to Yugoslavia to make a deal to import the Yugo to the United States himself. But Kefurt and YugoCars already held the exclusive import contract for 5,000 vehicles for the 1985 model year to be sold only in [[California]], and the California emissions certification was already in progress. In November 1984, the marketing rights were sold by YugoCars to International Automobile Importers (IAI) for $50,000 ($10 per car). Additionally, Miro Kefurt obtained an exclusive dealer franchise from IAI to sell the [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] [[X1/9]] in [[North Hollywood, California]]. 

YugoCars had intended to fit their Yugo 45 with the 903-cc, 45-horsepower 4-cylinder engine with a 3-way [[catalytic converter]] and [[oxygen sensor]] for emissions control. Predicted gas mileage was 42 to 45 mpg at 70&nbsp;mph. In late 1983, Zastava added a version called the Yugo 55, powered by a bigger engine used in the Fiat 101/128. IAI's Tony Ciminera preferred using this larger, 1,100 cc engine making 55 horsepower, though it would drop fuel economy to the 30&nbsp;MPG range, for it was faster and more able to keep up on American freeways. Even so, with an {{convert|86|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} top speed, it was the slowest car sold in the United States.<ref>Vuic, p. 83</ref>

Setting up Yugo America to import the car, Bricklin assigned Bill Prior to sort out the distribution and Tony Ciminera to fine-tune the Yugo for the American market. Ciminera carried out a bumper-to-bumper audit that resulted in more than 500 changes to meet the needs of the U.S. market, including compliance with American [[NHTSA|safety]] and [[Vehicle emissions control|emissions]] regulations. The vast Yugo facility was patterned after the Fiat factories of the early 1950s and employed 50,000, divided among 85 basic associated labor organizations and 25 work committees. For U.S. models, a separate assembly line was built with handpicked elite staff earning extra pay ($1.23 per hour extra), building Yugos destined for the New World. The first shift began at 6:00 am, and after an [[eight-hour day]], many employees left for their second jobs in other workplaces.{{CN|date=February 2020}}

The chief engineer and head of Zastava's Research and Development Institute was Zdravko Menjak, who worked with Bricklin's people at the plant to monitor the effort, constantly stressing the need for high quality. A team of British quality experts went to Kragujevac to study the factory and recommend improvements.{{CN|date=February 2020}}

Five models of Yugo were sold in the United States for the 1987 model year: the basic entry-level $3,990 GV (for \"Great Value\"){{CN|date=February 2020}}, the GVC with a glass sunroof, the nearly identical GVL and GVS with minor trim and upholstery upgrades, and the GVX with the 1,300-cc engine, five-speed manual transmission, and standard equipment including a plush interior, ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. The Cabrio [[convertible]] was introduced in 1988.

In the late 1980s, an automatic transmission was being sourced from Renault and a larger model (named the \"[[Yugo Florida|Florida]]\") had been styled by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and was in the early manufacturing stages. With the end of [[communism]], however, Yugoslavia began to unravel.

By 1990, the GV, GVL, and the 1,100-cc engine and four-speed manual transmission were replaced by a 1,300-cc [[OHC]] engine and five-speed manual transmission or a [[Renault]]-designed three-speed [[automatic transmission]], and an air conditioner with a holder for cooling two soft drink cans became optional on the GVX model. The standard model became the GV Plus.{{CN|date=February 2020}}

[[File:Yugo-US-poster.jpg|thumb|Ad for Yugo in the U.S. market]]
In 1990, Yugo America introduced an [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the Yugo GVX to replace the primitive [[Carburetor|carbureted]] engine,<ref>Vuic, p. 191</ref> but it arrived too late as the result of a [[Product recall|recall]] by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] of over 126,000 vehicles sold in the United States because they violated emissions regulations.{{CN|date=February 2020}} The recall effectively caused Yugo America to cease importation and fold in April 1992.<ref name=statistics>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8_tS2Vw13FcC&dat=19920421&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |title=Poor sales, civil war end for boxy, undependable Yugo |page=8 |author=Toledo Blade |publisher=The Toledo Blade Company |work=[[Google News]] |date=April 21, 1992 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}</ref> The noncompliant emission system used a carburetor of outdated design, an old-fashioned two-way [[catalytic converter]] with an [[Secondary air injection|air pump]], and [[exhaust gas recirculation]]. The power-reducing application of this primitive emissions control equipment on an already-weak engine was one of the major problems that caused the vehicles to get a reputation for poor drivability.{{CN|date=February 2020}}

By the early 1990s, the effects of the United Nations sanctions on Yugoslavia forced Zastava to withdraw the car from every export market. After embargoes stifled production, the ''[[coup de grâce]]'' was NATO's 1999 bombing of the company's automotive division, instead of Zastava's arms manufacturing division. Only in 2000 could production be restarted and not until 2003 was the Florida launched.

Malcolm Bricklin signed a deal with Zastava in 2002 to bring the Yugo back to the U.S. with a model tentatively called the ZMW. Under Bricklin's direction, Zastava Motor Works USA expected to sell 60,000 cars in 2003.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021205221445/http://www.forbes.com/2002/04/23/0423yugo.html \"Yugo Redux\"], ''Forbes'' magazine</ref> However, Bricklin instead turned to marketing the [[Chery]] line of Chinese cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0501/02/A01-47455.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130102140542/http://www.detroitnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0501/02/A01-47455.htm|url-status=dead|title=- The Detroit News - detroitnews.com|date=2 January 2013|archivedate=2 January 2013}}</ref> Bricklin's foray into importing and marketing Chery cars from China folded in mid- to late 2006 when Bricklin could not come up with the investment required to fund United States-specification vehicles from Chery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20061211/SUB/61208030?template=mobile |title=Dealers stick with Bricklin on venture |author=Donna Harris |work=[[Automotive News]] |publisher=[[Crain Communications]] |date=December 11, 2006 |accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>

===In the UK===
[[File:Zastava GB.jpg|thumb|Zastava (GB) LTD Headquarters, [[Reading, UK|Reading]]]]
Zastava Cars Limited (GB) set up its headquarters at Basingstoke Road in [[Reading, Berkshire]], in 1981, and the first cars seen by British motorists were the 1100/1300 series in the autumn of that year, badged as Zastava ZLC (five-door) and Zastava ZLM (three-door). These cars were based upon the Fiat 128 which had been voted European car of the year in 1969. The Kragujevac factory produced faithful copies of the 128 saloon, known as the Zastava 128 (Osmica) and then from 1971 also began production of the Zastava 101. The legendary “Stojadin” was a Fiat 128 with a redesigned rear which was available in three- and five-door hatchback versions. In 1982–1983, as sales slowly improved, Zastava Cars Limited introduced special trim levels in the form of the “Mediterranean” and the “Caribbean”. The United Kingdom market was the only market catered for right-hand drive versions.

By the time the first British users were adjusting to their new Yugoslav machines, attention in Yugoslavia had moved away from the Stojadin towards the new “Yugo” series which began production in October 1980 and appeared on British roads from 1983 onwards. The “Type 102” answered a call for a small, economical family car and was based mechanically on Fiat’s 127 hatchback. The styling of the car also owed much to the contemporary small Italian [[Autobianchi]] [[Abarth]], which was never available in the United Kingdom.

The “Type 102” morphed into the early production Yugo 45 with a 903 cc engine, later into the 55 with a 1,116 cc engine and then the more powerful 65 fitted with a 1,301 cc engine also became available in the British market. The new Yugo competed with indigenous cars such as the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] and [[Ford Fiesta (first generation)|Ford Fiesta MK1]]/[[Ford Fiesta (second generation)|MK2]], captive imports such as the [[Vauxhall Nova]] ([[Opel Corsa]] A), and French models like the [[Citroën Visa]] and [[Talbot Samba]].

In 1984 only, Zastava (GB) LTD imported small numbers of the Zastava 128. After that, with the company’s branding altered to “Yugo Cars”, relegating the Zastava name to the small print, Zastava (GB) LTD concentrated on selling the 101 range, branded as Yugo 311/313/511/513, and the 45/55/65 series. The cars sold steadily throughout the decade, and though they managed to avoid the dreadful reviews reserved for Lada and FSO, commentators in the British motoring press were rarely more than lukewarm in their praise of the car - a headline from 1986 read “The Yugo 55 is a good small car, but would you be seen in one?”

In 1988, Zastava launched the first of its new “Florida” range, envisaged as a long-term replacement for the ageing Stojadin. Styled by Giorgetto Guigiaro, the car was a modern design for the time, and bore more than a passing resemblance to the [[Citroën ZX]]. The Florida, marketed as the “Sana” in the United Kingdom, first appeared in Britain in 1990<ref>Vuic, p. 68</ref> and seemed set to fare well with positive early reviews. The Stojadin range ceased to be exported to the United Kingdom in 1991, with sales of the Sana under way.

By the end of the 1980s, Yugoslavia was on the brink of a disintegration that many anticipated under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Slovenia was the first to secede from the federation in the middle of 1991, swiftly followed by Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and finally Macedonia. Hostilities, other than in Macedonia, began not long afterwards.

This had direct implications for the company at Kragujevac. The Yugo had been envisaged as an all-Yugoslav car; the alternator came from Slovenia, the plastics and the interior from factories in Croatia, and the seats and rear trunk-struts from Serbia via Kosovo. The disintegration of the Yugoslav federation suddenly had supplies dry up at Kragujevac and production rates declined steeply. The Sana may well have established Yugo as a fixture in the United Kingdom market in the 1990s, but political developments left this prospect unrealized.

[[File:White Zastava Koral In during the Belgrade Car Show.jpg|thumb|Late-model Zastava Koral at a Belgrade Car Show]]
As the events of the wars of Yugoslav succession (1991–95 and 1999) unfolded, Zastava (GB) LTD became a barely noticed casualty. During Easter 1999, the Zastava factory in Kragujevac was targeted by NATO forces during the [[Kosovo]] campaign, and whilst severely damaged, was not put out of action. Supplies of vehicles to the United Kingdom were, however, reduced to a trickle in 1991 and 1992 and with the imposition of United Nations sanctions on [[Slobodan Milosević]]'s rump Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro), the company folded in 1993. The remaining Yugos on dealer forecourts were sold at drastically reduced prices or written off altogether as economically unviable.

====Marketing====
The Yugo was vigorously marketed in the late 1980s as a car that would fit into everybody's life, providing basic economical and reliable transportation along the lines of the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and the earlier [[Ford]] [[Model T]]. The car was promoted as a uniquely affordable new vehicle&nbsp;— providing an option for buyers who would otherwise have chosen a used vehicle&nbsp;— and as a reliable second car for wealthier buyers. The Yugo carried the tagline \"Everybody Needs A Yugo Sometime.\"<ref>{{YouTube|VV9NOBYDC4|Yugo}}</ref> This marketing appealed successfully to its target market of low-budget new car buyers, as well as wealthier people looking for an affordable second or third car.<ref>PETERS, E (2004): ''Automotive Atrocities: The Cars We Love to Hate''.

Along with other Central and Eastern European vehicles marketed in the West during the 20th century&nbsp;— such as the [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] — the Yugo was subjected to derision by critics who pointed to its use of old-generation Fiat technology and to alleged issues with build quality and reliability. The Yugo was voted as one of ''[[Car Talk]]''{{'s}} worst cars of the millennium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/Worst-Cars/results5.html |title=Car Talk |publisher=Car Talk |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318055419/http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/Worst-Cars/results5.html |archive-date=2010-03-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> Similarly, the Yugo GV was listed on ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''{{'}}s \"The 50 Worst Cars of All Time\" list,<ref name=time-worst>{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658533_1658529,00.html |title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time |author=Dan Neil and ''TIME'' |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071145/http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658533_1658529,00.html |archive-date=2016-04-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the Yugo 45 ranked #1 on ''[[Complex Magazine]]''{{'}}s \"The 50 Worst Cars of the '80s\" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/02/the-50-worst-cars-of-the-80s/ |title=The 50 Worst Cars of the '80s |author=Stirling Matheson |work=[[Complex Magazine]] |publisher=Complex Media |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331150845/http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/02/the-50-worst-cars-of-the-80s/ |archive-date=2016-03-31 |url-status=live }}</ref> Various other critics have added the Yugo to their [[List of automobiles considered the worst|lists of the worst cars]].<ref name=dmail-worst/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-top-ten-worst-cars-pictures-new-photogallery.html |title=The 10 worst cars sold in America |author=''LA Times'' Staff |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=Los Angeles Times Media Group |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407122734/http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-top-ten-worst-cars-pictures-new-photogallery.html |archive-date=2016-04-07 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=pm-worst>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g1766/10-cars-that-deserved-to-fail/? |title=10 Cars That Deserved to Fail |author=William Gock |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325222404/http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g1766/10-cars-that-deserved-to-fail/ |archive-date=2016-03-25 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Defenders of the vehicle have counter-argued that the Yugo's reputation suffered due to an issue that also appeared with initially inexpensive cars such as the [[Chevrolet Chevette]], [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]], [[Crosley]], and others&nbsp;— dealers were finding that too many owners were considering inexpensive cars as \"disposable\", and were failing to perform basic maintenance such as oil changes.

One critical maintenance issue specific to the Yugo 55 and 65 (the 45 was a 903 cc pushrod engine, with a timing chain){{citation needed|date=April 2016}} was the need for regular replacement of the [[interference engine]]'s timing belt&nbsp;— every {{convert|40000|mi|km|-3}}.<ref name=pm-worst/> In a non-interference engine, timing belt failure does not cause further damage to the engine. However, in an interference engine, failure of the timing belt disrupts the synchronization between pistons and [[poppet valve]]s, causing them to collide with one another (hence the name interference engine), thus potentially destroying the engine. Though this requirement was stressed in owners' manuals, it was frequently overlooked by owners. The factory also stressed the need for 89-octane fuels for the low-compression engines.

Some Yugo owners have reported that regular oil changes and appropriate maintenance allow the cars to remain dependable and trouble-free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inet.hr/~bpauric/eindex.htm |title=YUGO CARS.Web - English |publisher=Inet.hr |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614220936/http://www.inet.hr/~bpauric/eindex.htm |archive-date=2011-06-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1989, 31-year-old Leslie Ann Pluhar, driving a 1987 Yugo over the [[Mackinac Bridge]] in Michigan, died when her Yugo went over the bridge's {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} railing during {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} winds. The incident was widely publicized, with the make of car prominently identified. Many retellings claim that the car was physically lifted and blown off the bridge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/3232 |title=How to Build a Better Bridge |accessdate=2007-10-26 |author=David Propson |date=2004-10-14 |publisher=[[New York Sun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114172349/http://www.nysun.com/article/3232 |archive-date=2007-11-14 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/1989/10/02/8910020145.php |title=Mackinac Bridge Victim Is Recovered |accessdate=2008-10-27 |date=1989-10-02 |publisher=Madison.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212113125/http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=%2Ftct%2F1989%2F10%2F02%2F8910020145.php |archive-date=2008-12-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, a lawsuit by the family of the victim made no such claim, but proposed that the wind contributed to a loss of control that ended with the car's going off the bridge. Expert testimony disputed whether the winds were a major factor. Another proposed explanation is that a collision with a guardrail on the bridge's median \"launched\" the car onto the opposite guardrail.<ref>Vuic, The Yugo.</ref>

Owners of the Yugo and related models in the former Yugoslavia benefit from a ready supply of inexpensive spare parts due to general continuity in the car's design; local mechanics' ready familiarity with the Yugo also lowers the cost of ownership, since Yugos are so common and are even used as practice cars for apprentice mechanics. Also, the simplicity of the car's engine makes it easy to fix, and many Yugoslavian owners tended to fix the car themselves. All parts for the Yugo are readily available in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/10q3/ancient_grease_inside_the_midwest-bayless_fiat_shop-feature |title=Inside the Midwest-Bayless Fiat Shop - Feature |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=2011-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829111844/http://www.caranddriver.com/features/10q3/ancient_grease_inside_the_midwest-bayless_fiat_shop-feature |archive-date=2011-08-29 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A common U.S. joke regarding an inefficient vehicle is \"Yugo Nowhere\" (\"You Go Nowhere\"), referring to the failure of the car's sales in the United States.

A Zastava 101 (a sedan variant of the Yugo line) has been featured on the British motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', where it was featured in a segment filmed in Albania, where the three presenters referred to it as a \"Bentley Mulsanne\" after Bentley decided not to allow ''Top Gear'' to use an actual Mulsanne against a Mercedes S-Class 65 and a Rolls Royce Ghost. While presenters Richard Hammond and James May drove the very new Mercedes and Rolls Royce, respectively, Clarkson was originally supposed to drive the very new Bentley- so he had to drive the Yugo. In addition to Clarkson calling the Yugo \"the least refined car I've ever driven\", it was lambasted constantly, at one point overheated and failed to start, thoroughly physically trashed, and then driven off a cliff and destroyed while May was driving it to simulate a mock death for May after a staged police chase through Albania. In one segment in that episode, they attempted to put an obese Albanian man playing dead (sticking with their theme of which car they thought would be best for the Albanian Mafia) into the boot (trunk) of their cars. Surprisingly, the Yugo was the only successful car at this challenge, although the \"dead\" man was very visible in the car. It was also featured in one of Clarkson's motoring programs in the 1990s called ''Jeremy Clarkson: Unleashed on Cars''. He drove the Yugo, and after lambasting its performance, styling, and build quality, he then blew it up with a tank gun, and ran it over and crushed it with that same tank, totally destroying the car and reducing it to scrap metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHmas6JXVi8|title=Jeremy Clarkson destroying Yugo 45 & Volvo|last=Dušan Eremić|date=10 May 2008|via=YouTube|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925183002/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHmas6JXVi8|archive-date=2015-09-25|url-status=live}}</ref>

==End of production==
With the 794,428th and final car, production ended on November 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fawkes |first=Helen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739319.stm |title=Europe &#124; Yugo production grinds to a halt |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2009-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201105247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739319.stm |archive-date=2009-02-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Of that number, around 250,000 were exported to various countries.

==Today==
Years after its demise, the Yugo is still a common sight in Serbia, with almost 60,000 vehicles still in use,{{when|date=October 2015}} most of which were built in the 2000s. Parts are still readily available at most auto-parts stores and in scrapyards across the country. However, Yugos are rare in other Yugoslav republics (Excluding [[North Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]]), particularly in Slovenia, because most of them were \"imported\" back to Serbia in the early 2000s, most likely because most of them were in good shape for their age.

In the United States, few Yugos are left in service, likely because of international sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, which limited the supply of spare parts and service locations. The United Kingdom has around 100 Yugos still in existence and an owners club has been created. Unlike in the United States, the Yugo was never considered to be one of the worst cars ever imported in the UK, partly because other much worse cars were imported from Eastern Europe, particularly from former Soviet states, and partly because the expectations were not so high as in the United States.

One interesting version of the Yugo, the automatic one, is increasingly rare and estimates say that around 20 are left in use in Serbia, and most of those were sold in 1992, just after the sanctions were imposed, fetching a large value on auctions. A small number of newer Yugos can be found with automatic transmissions, and they were mostly built by request and featured a 1.3 liter engine.

<!-- Because of no major changes to the body or the drive train of the car, it is very easy to pinpoint the car's year of manufacture.{{Contradict-inline|date=July 2015}} -->Early 1980-1985 models featured butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only a single set of tail lights on each side of the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.

One popular \"upgrade\" to older (and even new) Yugos is [[autogas]] ([[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]) conversion which has gained widespread popularity in Serbia. Because most Yugos do not feature fuel injection, converting them to LPG is cheap and easy, and is paid off very quickly. One drawback of such conversions is that an already small trunk becomes almost useless, since an LPG tank takes up space. Such converted cars achieve better reliability since use of an unreliable gasoline pump is avoided. However, some cars have starting problems in very cold weather, because of improper LPG installation.

==In popular culture==

The car has achieved a symbolic status in former Yugoslavian countries due to the simplicity, reliability, and overall cheap price, and the Yugoslavian mentality of people regularly fixing their own cars instead of servicing them at their local garage. It was featured in many Yugoslavian films and TV series, and also in modern-day shows in former Yugoslavian countries. They are still very popular and are a common sight in former Yugoslavian countries (except [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Slovenia]]), and the large number of parts make it easily repairable.

In stark contrast, in the United States, the car was frequently subjected to ridicule and mockery and it has a universally negative rating. ''Car Talk'' has rated it the \"worst car of the millennium\", and many car magazines and TV shows rate it as the worst car of the 1980s and also [[List of automobiles known for negative reception|the worst car to be ever made]]. Despite the very low price setting in the US (with Yugo being the cheapest new car ever sold in the US when adjusted for inflation), it was ridiculed for the overall ugly design, poor quality, and large number of technical issues. Many American Yugos had faulty designs that were stressed in owners' manuals to be regularly serviced, but this caused even more ridicule due to owners overlooking these issues. The car has become a sort of a symbol for a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon car]]. The car was also featured in many TV shows and films, satirizing the car's poor design (the most famous examples being a rusty, beige-colored Yugo GV featured in ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance|,]] and a taxi-yellow Yugo in ''[[Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist]]'').

A Yugo was prominently featured in the 1987 feature film ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', with actor [[Dan Aykroyd]] even mentioning the car by make and model year in a voice-over. 

In the 2000 movie ''[[Drowning Mona]]'', everyone in the town of [[Verplanck, New York]] drives Yugos because in the fictional story of the film, Zastava (which in the film is falsely called the Yugo car company) chose the town for testing the car before its official launch on the US market.

In the animation film ''[[Cars 2]],'' there is a loser gang that largely consists of Yugos (called \"Hugos\" in the film) as well as [[AMC Gremlin|AMC Gremlins]] and [[AMC Pacer|AMC Pacers.]] 

In an episode of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]],'' [[Jeremy Clarkson]] drives a Yugo and calls it \"a hateful, hateful car\" and its performance so bad \"you get overtaken by wildlife\". In the end, he destroys it by shooting at it with a tank.<ref>{{Citation|title=Top Gear - Zastava Yugo 45 - Jeremy Blows Up Car :(|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D3ZDGrqUBY|language=en|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>

In a later episode of Top Gear, on a visit to [[Albania]], Jeremy Clarkson drives a red Yugo as a replacement for a [[Bentley Mulsanne (1980–92)|Bentley Mulsanne]], as an apparent dig at [[Bentley]] for not lending them a Mulsanne for that particular shoot. It was used as a joke car in comparison to [[Richard Hammond]]'s [[Mercedes S-Class]] and [[James May]]'s [[Rolls Royce Ghost]]. After a [[police]] chase after a supposed [[bank robbery]], [[James May]] decides to drive the Yugo off a cliff, rather than fall into police custody. <ref>{{Citation|title=Top Gear - Albanian Police Chase - James Drives Yugo Off Cliff :(|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OA9mA176mA|language=en|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>

A Yugo is also prominently featured in the music video for the 2008 song ''[[The Day That Never Comes]]'' by [[Metallica]].

In the 1999 film ''[[Bowfinger]]'' a poster in movie producer Bobby Bowfinger's office advertises his fictional film ''The Yugo Story''.

In the 2011 film ''[[Good Luck Charlie, It's Christmas!]]'', Teddy and Amy Duncan rent a Yugo for $50. Amy describes the car as \"10 years older than [Teddy],\" and \"made in a country that no longer exists.\"

In the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse]]'', a fictional modern version of the Yugo is advertised in [[Times Square]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Torchinsky |first1=Jason |title=The Most Important Thing About The New Spider-Man Trailer Is That There's A New Yugo |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-most-important-thing-to-know-about-the-new-spiderma-1826612642 |website=Jalopnik |accessdate=21 November 2019}}</ref>

A Yugo was used and appears in [[Mura Masa]]'s song ''Deal Wiv It.''

The '''Yugo''' ({{IPA-sh|ˈjûɡo|pron}}), also marketed as the '''Zastava Koral''' ({{IPA-sh|ˈzâːstaʋa ˈkǒraːl|pron}}, {{lang-sr-cyr|Застава Корал}}) and '''Yugo Koral''', is a [[subcompact car]] [[hatchback]] formerly manufactured by [[Zastava Automobiles]], at the time a [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] corporation.

Originally designed in Italy, as a shortened variant of the [[Fiat 128]], the first Yugo prototype was manufactured on 2 July 1977. Series production started on 28 November 1980. The Zastava Koral, a facelifted model, was marketed until 11 November 2008, after production of 794,428 cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magazinauto.com/pre-37-godina-sastavljen-je-prvi-jugo/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190119124747/https://www.magazinauto.com/pre-37-godina-sastavljen-je-prvi-jugo/ | archivedate = 2019-01-19 | title=Pre 36 godina sastavljen je prvi serijski Jugo | trans-title = The first Yugo was built 36 years ago | lang = sr | publisher=Auto Magazin |date=29 November 2016}}</ref>

The Yugo was marketed in the [[United States]] from 1985 to 1992 by [[Malcolm Bricklin]], with a total of 141,651 sold – peaking at 48,812 in 1987 and falling to 1,412 in 1992.

The car has been subjected to [[#Criticism and response|much criticism]] over its design and reliability; the historian Jason Vuic has called it \"the worst car in history.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Vuic|first=Jason|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a21082360/a-quick-history-of-the-yugo-the-worst-car-in-history/|title=A Quick Look at the Yugo, the Worst Car in History|date=2018-06-06|work=|access-date=2020-04-13|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Earlier models===
Yugo 45 derivative models have included the Yugo 55, 60, 65, Koral, Ciao, Tempo, Cabrio, GV, GV Plus, GVX, and GVL. Yugo engines were fitted with a [[carburetor]] until well into the 1980s before fuel-injected models (starting with the Koral 65) were gradually introduced, beginning with the GVX-EFI (an [[electronic fuel injection]] system), which featured a 1300-cc engine. Yugo did not only target the [[Western Bloc|West]]: In early 1985 500 Yugos were exported to China, and exports to Bulgaria and Egypt were already established.<ref name=AGp54>{{cite magazine | ref = AG140 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 140 | volume = 6 | page = 54 | title = Zastava en cie | trans-title = Zastava and company | first = Peter | last = Homola | language = nl-be | date = 1985-02-07 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref>

[[File:Yugo.jpg|thumb|left|Two earlier Yugo models in [[Priština]]]]

The fuel-injection system was a Motronic MP3.1, which was later developed with [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] to Motronic M4.6 MPI on 1.1- and 1.3-L engines and had [[Multi Point Injection|multiport fuel injection]] with a three-way [[catalytic converter]] and [[lambda sensor|\"Lambda\" sensor]].<ref>[http://www.zpkg.com/forum1/Koral/Uputstva/Motronic_M4.6_Teorijske_osnove.pdf Motronic MP3.1]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

===Later models===
Near the end of its production run, Zastava sold an updated version of the Yugo Koral model, known as the Zastava Koral IN, which had
[[central locking]],  a three-step rotary switch on the dash marked \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" for a headlamps leveling control in four height positions, a [[loudspeaker|four-speaker]] [[Car audio|audio system]], [[electric window]]s, [[Side-view mirror|folding electro-adjustable side-view mirrors]], alloy wheels, an optional [[Car air conditioning|air conditioner]], and an optional [[Renault]]-designed three-speed [[automatic transmission]]. Zastava sold these in Serbia, [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Greece]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Egypt]].

Besides all the Koral versions available, other models included the Florida and Skala. In October 2003, an agreement with Fiat was reached for production of the [[Fiat Punto]] by Zastava for Eastern European markets, which was known as the [[Zastava 10]].

The Koral IN L, with a [[Peugeot]] fuel-injected 1.1 L-{{convert|60|PS|kW|abbr=on}} engine, met the [[European Union]] safety standards in a test supervised by the German [[Technischer Überwachungsverein]] (Technical Monitoring Association), a necessary step for importation to E.U. countries.

Zastava was founded as an arms manufacturer in 1853. By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into automobile production supplying [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]-designed trucks to the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]. Vehicle production continued until 1941, when [[World War II]] reached Yugoslavia. Following the war, Zastava was permitted to produce Jeeps under license from [[Willys-Overland]] until production was halted in the early 1950s.

The first passenger models were produced on 26 August 1953 using designs licensed by Fiat of [[Turin]]. The first model designed by Zastava was a sedan called the Milletrecento (\"one thousand three hundred\") powered by a 1,300 [[Cubic centimeter|cc]] engine. Some of the most successful models were those based on the [[Fiat 128]] model, marketed under different names: Zastava 101, Zastava 128, Zastava 311, Zastava Skala, etc.

Zastava continued to produce vehicles for the Yugoslav and European markets until exports were limited by sanctions imposed by the [[United Nations]] in the 1990s. In 1984, automobile entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin tested the United States market for Zastava vehicles, now branded as Yugo. As a result, in mid-1986, Yugo America began selling cars at a starting price of $3,990 for the entry-level GV (\"Good Value\") hatchback equipped with the 1,100 cc overhead-cam five-main-bearing engine and four-speed manual transmission. The similar GVL offered a plusher interior, but the sporty top-line GVX was powered by the 1,300 cc engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission, and included as standard equipment a number of deluxe features such as a ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. However, though the GVX was billed as an upscale, sporty version of the base GV, it went from 0-60&nbsp;mph in 13.56 seconds, just a half a second faster than the GV.<ref name=Vuic>{{citation | title = The Yugo: The Rise and Fall of the Worst Car in History | last = Vuic | first = Jason | page = 176 | publisher = Hill and Wang | location = New York City | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8090-9891-0}}</ref> When the political instability in Yugoslavia intensified in early 1992, Zastava was forced to stop exports.

Today, various models are available in the former Yugoslavia, including an agreement signed with Fiat for the production of the 2003 [[Fiat Punto]] model.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://english.eastday.com/eastday/englishedition/business/userobject1ai1474719.html english.eastday.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212130356/http://english.eastday.com/eastday/englishedition/business/userobject1ai1474719.html |date=2006-02-12 }}</ref>

===1988–1991===
[[File:Yugo Police Car.jpg|thumb|A 1990 Yugo police car in [[Croatia]]]]
Many mechanics and even Zastava factory workers agree that the \"best\" Yugos ever were built between 1988 and early 1991. Quality control was good; high standards were set in terms of plastic quality, seat cloth, and \"a well screwed together\" interior. Paint and antirust coatings were also well done during that period, evidenced by many cars still showing no signs of rust, tears in the seats, or major engine issues after more than 20 years.

1989 was considered a \"golden year\" for Yugos because almost 200,000 were built that year, and many can still be seen on the road today. Also, cars were usually branded Yugo instead of Zastava during that period, because the company was taking pride in the (at the time) good sales and reputation established in the export markets, especially in the United States.

In 1990, a batch of 450 cars with automatic transmissions and [[air conditioning]] was shipped to the United States. With political problems starting in 1991, quality dropped significantly, coming to such low standards such as plastic parts of the dashboard not fitting correctly.

===1991–1996===
Because the Yugo was built as a \"Yugoslav\" car with political problems and civil war breaking out in 1990–91, production slowed down and the supply of parts was interrupted. Most of the plastic came from Croatia, while the alternators and electrical equipment came from Slovenia. With the start of civil war, economic and transportation ties were broken, resulting in shortage of most parts coming from the two seceded republics. Though the sanctions were not in place until May 1992, Yugos built between June 1991 and early 1996 were built with a variety of \"leftover\" parts: as an example, getting a car with a blue dashboard and a brown steering wheel, seats that were mismatched in color, and most likely an \"American\" instrument cluster with speeds printed in MPH rather than km/h, and with written labels like water and oil instead of small drawings, and a seatbelt safety warning light were possible. In some extreme cases, the car would come with different interior panels and a steering wheel from other Zastava products such as the Zastava 750. When exports to United States (and the rest of the world) stopped, a number of federalized Yugos were still left in the factory's parking lots, and many people got these \"American\" Yugos instead of the European ones. When Yugoslavia broke apart in the early 1990s, production rates steeply declined to 14,000 in 1992, 7,000 in 1993 and 1994, and 9,000 in 1995. In 1996, when sanctions were lifted, production rates slowly increased as living standards in the former Yugoslavia started to improve. Even so, problems for the factory started once again when it was put out of production in mid-1999 as a result of war with [[NATO]].

===In the United States===
{{refimprove-section|date=February 2020}}

International Automobile Importers (IAI) was a company founded by [[Malcolm Bricklin]] to import the X1/9 and 2000 Spider after Fiat halted their manufacture.<ref>Vuic, p. 21</ref> Bertone and [[Pininfarina]] carried on production under their own names and Bricklin's IAI took over their U.S. importation. Bricklin wanted to import additional brands, and international dealmaker [[Armand Hammer]] had been asked by the Yugoslavs to identify business areas in which they could generate exports to bolster their economy. Hammer thought the idea of exporting the small cars made in [[Kragujevac]], Serbia, by Zavodi Crvena Zastava, would be viable. Zastava had, since the mid-19th century, been a quality armaments producer and sponsored its own museum.

As Zastava celebrated its 100th anniversary, it started producing vehicles made under license from the Italian company Fiat, located just across the [[Adriatic]] Sea. For three decades, Zastava produced the rear-engined 600 and the 101, a bustle-backed version of the [[Fiat 128]]. On its own initiative in 1980, Zastava introduced its Jugo or Yugo model which, though still using Fiat 128-type powertrain and other components, was in fact an update of the Fiat 127{{CN|date=February 2020}} styled in Turin.{{CN|date=February 2020}}. Zastava was already exporting its new offering to other Eastern European markets, installing the bigger 128 overhead-cam engine for a top speed of {{convert|90|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

In 1982, U.S. entrepreneur Miro Kefurt contacted Zastava in Kragujevac (ZCZ-Zavodi Crvena Zastava) with an idea to export the Yugo 45 to the United States.<ref>Vuic, p. 11</ref> The vehicles were to be renamed Yugo GV for the United States market and YugoCars, Inc. was formed in [[Sun Valley, California]], by Kefurt and Ray Burns. The proposal required approval by Fiat in [[Italy]] due to existing contractual restrictions in effect for Fiat—Zastava collaborations.

The first three Yugo vehicles, painted red, white, and blue, were introduced to the U.S. public at the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] in May 1984. The car was promoted with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty, free maintenance, and a price of only $4,500. Front-page articles about the Yugo appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (Business Section), ''[[New York Times]]'', and ''[[The National Enquirer]]''. However, problems soon arose as one car was sent to the [[California Air Resources Board]] for emissions testing, which it badly failed. The Yugo needed lots of reengineering, and with no help forthcoming from Zastava, Kefurt was in a problematic situation.<ref>Vuic, p. 16</ref>

Reportedly, [[Malcolm Bricklin]] attended the Los Angeles Auto Show, and while the show was still in progress, flew to Yugoslavia to make a deal to import the Yugo to the United States himself. But Kefurt and YugoCars already held the exclusive import contract for 5,000 vehicles for the 1985 model year to be sold only in [[California]], and the California emissions certification was already in progress. In November 1984, the marketing rights were sold by YugoCars to International Automobile Importers (IAI) for $50,000 ($10 per car). Additionally, Miro Kefurt obtained an exclusive dealer franchise from IAI to sell the [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] [[X1/9]] in [[North Hollywood, California]]. 

YugoCars had intended to fit their Yugo 45 with the 903-cc, 45-horsepower 4-cylinder engine with a 3-way [[catalytic converter]] and [[oxygen sensor]] for emissions control. Predicted gas mileage was 42 to 45 mpg at 70&nbsp;mph. In late 1983, Zastava added a version called the Yugo 55, powered by a bigger engine used in the Fiat 101/128. IAI's Tony Ciminera preferred using this larger, 1,100 cc engine making 55 horsepower, though it would drop fuel economy to the 30&nbsp;MPG range, for it was faster and more able to keep up on American freeways. Even so, with an {{convert|86|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} top speed, it was the slowest car sold in the United States.<ref>Vuic, p. 83</ref>

Setting up Yugo America to import the car, Bricklin assigned Bill Prior to sort out the distribution and Tony Ciminera to fine-tune the Yugo for the American market. Ciminera carried out a bumper-to-bumper audit that resulted in more than 500 changes to meet the needs of the U.S. market, including compliance with American [[NHTSA|safety]] and [[Vehicle emissions control|emissions]] regulations. The vast Yugo facility was patterned after the Fiat factories of the early 1950s and employed 50,000, divided among 85 basic associated labor organizations and 25 work committees. For U.S. models, a separate assembly line was built with handpicked elite staff earning extra pay ($1.23 per hour extra), building Yugos destined for the New World. The first shift began at 6:00 am, and after an [[eight-hour day]], many employees left for their second jobs in other workplaces.{{CN|date=February 2020}}

The chief engineer and head of Zastava's Research and Development Institute was Zdravko Menjak, who worked with Bricklin's people at the plant to monitor the effort, constantly stressing the need for high quality. A team of British quality experts went to Kragujevac to study the factory and recommend improvements.{{CN|date=February 2020}}

Five models of Yugo were sold in the United States for the 1987 model year: the basic entry-level $3,990 GV (for \"Great Value\"){{CN|date=February 2020}}, the GVC with a glass sunroof, the nearly identical GVL and GVS with minor trim and upholstery upgrades, and the GVX with the 1,300-cc engine, five-speed manual transmission, and standard equipment including a plush interior, ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. The Cabrio [[convertible]] was introduced in 1988.

In the late 1980s, an automatic transmission was being sourced from Renault and a larger model (named the \"[[Yugo Florida|Florida]]\") had been styled by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and was in the early manufacturing stages. With the end of [[communism]], however, Yugoslavia began to unravel.

By 1990, the GV, GVL, and the 1,100-cc engine and four-speed manual transmission were replaced by a 1,300-cc [[OHC]] engine and five-speed manual transmission or a [[Renault]]-designed three-speed [[automatic transmission]], and an air conditioner with a holder for cooling two soft drink cans became optional on the GVX model. The standard model became the GV Plus.{{CN|date=February 2020}}

[[File:Yugo-US-poster.jpg|thumb|Ad for Yugo in the U.S. market]]
In 1990, Yugo America introduced an [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the Yugo GVX to replace the primitive [[Carburetor|carbureted]] engine,<ref>Vuic, p. 191</ref> but it arrived too late as the result of a [[Product recall|recall]] by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] of over 126,000 vehicles sold in the United States because they violated emissions regulations.{{CN|date=February 2020}} The recall effectively caused Yugo America to cease importation and fold in April 1992.<ref name=statistics>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8_tS2Vw13FcC&dat=19920421&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |title=Poor sales, civil war end for boxy, undependable Yugo |page=8 |author=Toledo Blade |publisher=The Toledo Blade Company |work=[[Google News]] |date=April 21, 1992 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}</ref> The noncompliant emission system used a carburetor of outdated design, an old-fashioned two-way [[catalytic converter]] with an [[Secondary air injection|air pump]], and [[exhaust gas recirculation]]. The power-reducing application of this primitive emissions control equipment on an already-weak engine was one of the major problems that caused the vehicles to get a reputation for poor drivability.{{CN|date=February 2020}}

By the early 1990s, the effects of the United Nations sanctions on Yugoslavia forced Zastava to withdraw the car from every export market. After embargoes stifled production, the ''[[coup de grâce]]'' was NATO's 1999 bombing of the company's automotive division, instead of Zastava's arms manufacturing division. Only in 2000 could production be restarted and not until 2003 was the Florida launched.

Malcolm Bricklin signed a deal with Zastava in 2002 to bring the Yugo back to the U.S. with a model tentatively called the ZMW. Under Bricklin's direction, Zastava Motor Works USA expected to sell 60,000 cars in 2003.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021205221445/http://www.forbes.com/2002/04/23/0423yugo.html \"Yugo Redux\"], ''Forbes'' magazine</ref> However, Bricklin instead turned to marketing the [[Chery]] line of Chinese cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0501/02/A01-47455.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130102140542/http://www.detroitnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0501/02/A01-47455.htm|url-status=dead|title=- The Detroit News - detroitnews.com|date=2 January 2013|archivedate=2 January 2013}}</ref> Bricklin's foray into importing and marketing Chery cars from China folded in mid- to late 2006 when Bricklin could not come up with the investment required to fund United States-specification vehicles from Chery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20061211/SUB/61208030?template=mobile |title=Dealers stick with Bricklin on venture |author=Donna Harris |work=[[Automotive News]] |publisher=[[Crain Communications]] |date=December 11, 2006 |accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>

===In the UK===
[[File:Zastava GB.jpg|thumb|Zastava (GB) LTD Headquarters, [[Reading, UK|Reading]]]]
Zastava Cars Limited (GB) set up its headquarters at Basingstoke Road in [[Reading, Berkshire]], in 1981, and the first cars seen by British motorists were the 1100/1300 series in the autumn of that year, badged as Zastava ZLC (five-door) and Zastava ZLM (three-door). These cars were based upon the Fiat 128 which had been voted European car of the year in 1969. The Kragujevac factory produced faithful copies of the 128 saloon, known as the Zastava 128 (Osmica) and then from 1971 also began production of the Zastava 101. The legendary “Stojadin” was a Fiat 128 with a redesigned rear which was available in three- and five-door hatchback versions. In 1982–1983, as sales slowly improved, Zastava Cars Limited introduced special trim levels in the form of the “Mediterranean” and the “Caribbean”. The United Kingdom market was the only market catered for right-hand drive versions.

By the time the first British users were adjusting to their new Yugoslav machines, attention in Yugoslavia had moved away from the Stojadin towards the new “Yugo” series which began production in October 1980 and appeared on British roads from 1983 onwards. The “Type 102” answered a call for a small, economical family car and was based mechanically on Fiat’s 127 hatchback. The styling of the car also owed much to the contemporary small Italian [[Autobianchi]] [[Abarth]], which was never available in the United Kingdom.

The “Type 102” morphed into the early production Yugo 45 with a 903 cc engine, later into the 55 with a 1,116 cc engine and then the more powerful 65 fitted with a 1,301 cc engine also became available in the British market. The new Yugo competed with indigenous cars such as the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] and [[Ford Fiesta (first generation)|Ford Fiesta MK1]]/[[Ford Fiesta (second generation)|MK2]], captive imports such as the [[Vauxhall Nova]] ([[Opel Corsa]] A), and French models like the [[Citroën Visa]] and [[Talbot Samba]].

In 1984 only, Zastava (GB) LTD imported small numbers of the Zastava 128. After that, with the company’s branding altered to “Yugo Cars”, relegating the Zastava name to the small print, Zastava (GB) LTD concentrated on selling the 101 range, branded as Yugo 311/313/511/513, and the 45/55/65 series. The cars sold steadily throughout the decade, and though they managed to avoid the dreadful reviews reserved for Lada and FSO, commentators in the British motoring press were rarely more than lukewarm in their praise of the car - a headline from 1986 read “The Yugo 55 is a good small car, but would you be seen in one?”

In 1988, Zastava launched the first of its new “Florida” range, envisaged as a long-term replacement for the ageing Stojadin. Styled by Giorgetto Guigiaro, the car was a modern design for the time, and bore more than a passing resemblance to the [[Citroën ZX]]. The Florida, marketed as the “Sana” in the United Kingdom, first appeared in Britain in 1990<ref>Vuic, p. 68</ref> and seemed set to fare well with positive early reviews. The Stojadin range ceased to be exported to the United Kingdom in 1991, with sales of the Sana under way.

By the end of the 1980s, Yugoslavia was on the brink of a disintegration that many anticipated under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Slovenia was the first to secede from the federation in the middle of 1991, swiftly followed by Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and finally Macedonia. Hostilities, other than in Macedonia, began not long afterwards.

This had direct implications for the company at Kragujevac. The Yugo had been envisaged as an all-Yugoslav car; the alternator came from Slovenia, the plastics and the interior from factories in Croatia, and the seats and rear trunk-struts from Serbia via Kosovo. The disintegration of the Yugoslav federation suddenly had supplies dry up at Kragujevac and production rates declined steeply. The Sana may well have established Yugo as a fixture in the United Kingdom market in the 1990s, but political developments left this prospect unrealized.

[[File:White Zastava Koral In during the Belgrade Car Show.jpg|thumb|Late-model Zastava Koral at a Belgrade Car Show]]
As the events of the wars of Yugoslav succession (1991–95 and 1999) unfolded, Zastava (GB) LTD became a barely noticed casualty. During Easter 1999, the Zastava factory in Kragujevac was targeted by NATO forces during the [[Kosovo]] campaign, and whilst severely damaged, was not put out of action. Supplies of vehicles to the United Kingdom were, however, reduced to a trickle in 1991 and 1992 and with the imposition of United Nations sanctions on [[Slobodan Milosević]]'s rump Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro), the company folded in 1993. The remaining Yugos on dealer forecourts were sold at drastically reduced prices or written off altogether as economically unviable.

====Marketing====
The Yugo was vigorously marketed in the late 1980s as a car that would fit into everybody's life, providing basic economical and reliable transportation along the lines of the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and the earlier [[Ford]] [[Model T]]. The car was promoted as a uniquely affordable new vehicle&nbsp;— providing an option for buyers who would otherwise have chosen a used vehicle&nbsp;— and as a reliable second car for wealthier buyers. The Yugo carried the tagline \"Everybody Needs A Yugo Sometime.\"<ref>{{YouTube|VV9NOBYDC4|Yugo}}</ref> This marketing appealed successfully to its target market of low-budget new car buyers, as well as wealthier people looking for an affordable second or third car.<ref>PETERS, E (2004): ''Automotive Atrocities: The Cars We Love to Hate''. Motorbooks International.</ref> A popular ad included the 39-90 campaign, a play on the $3,990 price of the car.

==Criticism and response==
Along with other Central and Eastern European vehicles marketed in the West during the 20th century&nbsp;— such as the [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] — the Yugo was subjected to derision by critics who pointed to its use of old-generation Fiat technology and to alleged issues with build quality and reliability. The Yugo was voted as one of ''[[Car Talk]]''{{'s}} worst cars of the millennium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/Worst-Cars/results5.html |title=Car Talk |publisher=Car Talk |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318055419/http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/Worst-Cars/results5.html |archive-date=2010-03-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> Similarly, the Yugo GV was listed on ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''{{'}}s \"The 50 Worst Cars of All Time\" list,<ref name=time-worst>{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658533_1658529,00.html |title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time |author=Dan Neil and ''TIME'' |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071145/http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658533_1658529,00.html |archive-date=2016-04-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the Yugo 45 ranked #1 on ''[[Complex Magazine]]''{{'}}s \"The 50 Worst Cars of the '80s\" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/02/the-50-worst-cars-of-the-80s/ |title=The 50 Worst Cars of the '80s |author=Stirling Matheson |work=[[Complex Magazine]] |publisher=Complex Media |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331150845/http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/02/the-50-worst-cars-of-the-80s/ |archive-date=2016-03-31 |url-status=live }}</ref> Various other critics have added the Yugo to their [[List of automobiles considered the worst|lists of the worst cars]].<ref name=dmail-worst/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-top-ten-worst-cars-pictures-new-photogallery.html |title=The 10 worst cars sold in America |author=''LA Times'' Staff |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=Los Angeles Times Media Group |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407122734/http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-top-ten-worst-cars-pictures-new-photogallery.html |archive-date=2016-04-07 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=pm-worst>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g1766/10-cars-that-deserved-to-fail/? |title=10 Cars That Deserved to Fail |author=William Gock |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325222404/http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g1766/10-cars-that-deserved-to-fail/ |archive-date=2016-03-25 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Defenders of the vehicle have counter-argued that the Yugo's reputation suffered due to an issue that also appeared with initially inexpensive cars such as the [[Chevrolet Chevette]], [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]], [[Crosley]], and others&nbsp;— dealers were finding that too many owners were considering inexpensive cars as \"disposable\", and were failing to perform basic maintenance such as oil changes.

One critical maintenance issue specific to the Yugo 55 and 65 (the 45 was a 903 cc pushrod engine, with a timing chain){{citation needed|date=April 2016}} was the need for regular replacement of the [[interference engine]]'s timing belt&nbsp;— every {{convert|40000|mi|km|-3}}.<ref name=pm-worst/> In a non-interference engine, timing belt failure does not cause further damage to the engine. However, in an interference engine, failure of the timing belt disrupts the synchronization between pistons and [[poppet valve]]s, causing them to collide with one another (hence the name interference engine), thus potentially destroying the engine. Though this requirement was stressed in owners' manuals, it was frequently overlooked by owners. The factory also stressed the need for 89-octane fuels for the low-compression engines.

Some Yugo owners have reported that regular oil changes and appropriate maintenance allow the cars to remain dependable and trouble-free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inet.hr/~bpauric/eindex.htm |title=YUGO CARS.Web - English |publisher=Inet.hr |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614220936/http://www.inet.hr/~bpauric/eindex.htm |archive-date=2011-06-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1989, 31-year-old Leslie Ann Pluhar, driving a 1987 Yugo over the [[Mackinac Bridge]] in Michigan, died when her Yugo went over the bridge's {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} railing during {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} winds. The incident was widely publicized, with the make of car prominently identified. Many retellings claim that the car was physically lifted and blown off the bridge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/3232 |title=How to Build a Better Bridge |accessdate=2007-10-26 |author=David Propson |date=2004-10-14 |publisher=[[New York Sun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114172349/http://www.nysun.com/article/3232 |archive-date=2007-11-14 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/1989/10/02/8910020145.php |title=Mackinac Bridge Victim Is Recovered |accessdate=2008-10-27 |date=1989-10-02 |publisher=Madison.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212113125/http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=%2Ftct%2F1989%2F10%2F02%2F8910020145.php |archive-date=2008-12-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, a lawsuit by the family of the victim made no such claim, but proposed that the wind contributed to a loss of control that ended with the car's going off the bridge. Expert testimony disputed whether the winds were a major factor. Another proposed explanation is that a collision with a guardrail on the bridge's median \"launched\" the car onto the opposite guardrail.<ref>Vuic, The Yugo.</ref>

Owners of the Yugo and related models in the former Yugoslavia benefit from a ready supply of inexpensive spare parts due to general continuity in the car's design; local mechanics' ready familiarity with the Yugo also lowers the cost of ownership, since Yugos are so common and are even used as practice cars for apprentice mechanics. Also, the simplicity of the car's engine makes it easy to fix, and many Yugoslavian owners tended to fix the car themselves. All parts for the Yugo are readily available in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/10q3/ancient_grease_inside_the_midwest-bayless_fiat_shop-feature |title=Inside the Midwest-Bayless Fiat Shop - Feature |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=2011-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829111844/http://www.caranddriver.com/features/10q3/ancient_grease_inside_the_midwest-bayless_fiat_shop-feature |archive-date=2011-08-29 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A common U.S. joke regarding an inefficient vehicle is \"Yugo Nowhere\" (\"You Go Nowhere\"), referring to the failure of the car's sales in the United States.

A Zastava 101 (a sedan variant of the Yugo line) has been featured on the British motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', where it was featured in a segment filmed in Albania, where the three presenters referred to it as a \"Bentley Mulsanne\" after Bentley decided not to allow ''Top Gear'' to use an actual Mulsanne against a Mercedes S-Class 65 and a Rolls Royce Ghost. While presenters Richard Hammond and James May drove the very new Mercedes and Rolls Royce, respectively, Clarkson was originally supposed to drive the very new Bentley- so he had to drive the Yugo. In addition to Clarkson calling the Yugo \"the least refined car I've ever driven\", it was lambasted constantly, at one point overheated and failed to start, thoroughly physically trashed, and then driven off a cliff and destroyed while May was driving it to simulate a mock death for May after a staged police chase through Albania. In one segment in that episode, they attempted to put an obese Albanian man playing dead (sticking with their theme of which car they thought would be best for the Albanian Mafia) into the boot (trunk) of their cars. Surprisingly, the Yugo was the only successful car at this challenge, although the \"dead\" man was very visible in the car. It was also featured in one of Clarkson's motoring programs in the 1990s called ''Jeremy Clarkson: Unleashed on Cars''. He drove the Yugo, and after lambasting its performance, styling, and build quality, he then blew it up with a tank gun, and ran it over and crushed it with that same tank, totally destroying the car and reducing it to scrap metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHmas6JXVi8|title=Jeremy Clarkson destroying Yugo 45 & Volvo|last=Dušan Eremić|date=10 May 2008|via=YouTube|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925183002/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHmas6JXVi8|archive-date=2015-09-25|url-status=live}}</ref>

==End of production==
With the 794,428th and final car, production ended on November 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fawkes |first=Helen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739319.stm |title=Europe &#124; Yugo production grinds to a halt |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2009-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201105247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739319.stm |archive-date=2009-02-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Of that number, around 250,000 were exported to various countries.

==Today==
Years after its demise, the Yugo is still a common sight in Serbia, with almost 60,000 vehicles still in use,{{when|date=October 2015}} most of which were built in the 2000s. Parts are still readily available at most auto-parts stores and in scrapyards across the country. However, Yugos are rare in other Yugoslav republics, particularly in Slovenia, because most of them were \"imported\" back to Serbia in the early 2000s, most likely because most of them were in good shape for their age.

In the United States, few Yugos are left in service, likely because of international sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, which limited the supply of spare parts and service locations. The United Kingdom has around 100 Yugos still in existence and an owners club has been created. Unlike in the United States, the Yugo was never considered to be one of the worst cars ever imported in the UK, partly because other much worse cars were imported from Eastern Europe, particularly from former Soviet states, and partly because the expectations were not so high as in the United States.

One interesting version of the Yugo, the automatic one, is increasingly rare and estimates say that around 20 are left in use in Serbia, and most of those were sold in 1992, just after the sanctions were imposed, fetching a large value on auctions. A small number of newer Yugos can be found with automatic transmissions, and they were mostly built by request and featured a 1.3 liter engine.

<!-- Because of no major changes to the body or the drive train of the car, it is very easy to pinpoint the car's year of manufacture.{{Contradict-inline|date=July 2015}} -->Early 1980-1985 models featured butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only a single set of tail lights on each side of the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.

One popular \"upgrade\" to older (and even new) Yugos is [[autogas]] ([[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]) conversion which has gained widespread popularity in Serbia. Because most Yugos do not feature fuel injection, converting them to LPG is cheap and easy, and is paid off very quickly. One drawback of such conversions is that an already small trunk becomes almost useless, since an LPG tank takes up space. Such converted cars achieve better reliability since use of an unreliable gasoline pump is avoided. However, some cars have starting problems in very cold weather, because of improper LPG installation.

==In popular culture==

The car has achieved a symbolic status in former Yugoslavian countries due to the simplicity, reliability, and overall cheap price, and the Yugoslavian mentality of people regularly fixing their own cars instead of servicing them at their local garage. It was featured in many Yugoslavian films and TV series, and also in modern-day shows in former Yugoslavian countries. They are still very popular and are a common sight in former Yugoslavian countries (except [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Slovenia]]), and the large number of parts make it easily repairable.

In stark contrast, in the United States, the car was frequently subjected to ridicule and mockery and it has a universally negative rating. ''Car Talk'' has rated it the \"worst car of the millennium\", and many car magazines and TV shows rate it as the worst car of the 1980s and also [[List of automobiles known for negative reception|the worst car to be ever made]]. Despite the very low price setting in the US (with Yugo being the cheapest new car ever sold in the US when adjusted for inflation), it was ridiculed for the overall ugly design, poor quality, and large number of technical issues. Many American Yugos had faulty designs that were stressed in owners' manuals to be regularly serviced, but this caused even more ridicule due to owners overlooking these issues. The car has become a sort of a symbol for a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon car]]. The car was also featured in many TV shows and films, satirizing the car's poor design (the most famous examples being a rusty, beige-colored Yugo GV featured in ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance|,]] and a taxi-yellow Yugo in ''[[Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist]]'').

A Yugo was prominently featured in the 1987 feature film ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', with actor [[Dan Aykroyd]] even mentioning the car by make and model year in a voice-over. 

In the 2000 movie ''[[Drowning Mona]]'', everyone in the town of [[Verplanck, New York]] drives Yugos because in the fictional story of the film, Zastava (which in the film is falsely called the Yugo car company) chose the town for testing the car before its official launch on the US market.

In the animation film ''[[Cars 2]],'' there is a loser gang that largely consists of Yugos (called \"Hugos\" in the film) as well as [[AMC Gremlin|AMC Gremlins]] and [[AMC Pacer|AMC Pacers.]] 

In an episode of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]],'' [[Jeremy Clarkson]] drives a Yugo and calls it \"a hateful, hateful car\" and its performance so bad \"you get overtaken by wildlife\". In the end, he destroys it by shooting at it with a tank.<ref>{{Citation|title=Top Gear - Zastava Yugo 45 - Jeremy Blows Up Car :(|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D3ZDGrqUBY|language=en|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>

In a later episode of Top Gear, on a visit to [[Albania]], Jeremy Clarkson drives a red Yugo as a replacement for a [[Bentley Mulsanne (1980–92)|Bentley Mulsanne]], as an apparent dig at [[Bentley]] for not lending them a Mulsanne for that particular shoot. It was used as a joke car in comparison to [[Richard Hammond]]'s [[Mercedes S-Class]] and [[James May]]'s [[Rolls Royce Ghost]]. After a [[police]] chase after a supposed [[bank robbery]], [[James May]] decides to drive the Yugo off a cliff, rather than fall into police custody. <ref>{{Citation|title=Top Gear - Albanian Police Chase - James Drives Yugo Off Cliff :(|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OA9mA176mA|language=en|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>

A Yugo is also prominently featured in the music video for the 2008 song ''[[The Day That Never Comes]]'' by [[Metallica]].

In the 1999 film ''[[Bowfinger]]'' a poster in movie producer Bobby Bowfinger's office advertises his fictional film ''The Yugo Story''.

In the 2011 film ''[[Good Luck Charlie, It's Christmas!]]'', Teddy and Amy Duncan rent a Yugo for $50. Amy describes the car as \"10 years older than [Teddy],\" and \"made in a country that no longer exists.\"

In the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse]]'', a fictional modern version of the Yugo is advertised in [[Times Square]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Torchinsky |first1=Jason |title=The Most Important Thing About The New Spider-Man Trailer Is That There's A New Yugo |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-most-important-thing-to-know-about-the-new-spiderma-1826612642 |website=Jalopnik |accessdate=21 November 2019}}</ref>

A Yugo was used and appears in [[Mura Masa]]'s song ''Deal Wiv It.''

The '''2004 United States Senate election in Illinois''' was held on November 2, 2004. [[Incumbent]] Republican U.S. Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (politician)|Peter Fitzgerald]] decided to retire after one term. The Democratic and Republican [[primary election]]s were held in March, which included a total of 15 candidates who combined to spend a record total of over $60 million seeking the [[open seat]].

On March 16, 2004, State Senator [[Barack Obama]] won the Democratic primary, and businessman [[Jack Ryan (politician)|Jack Ryan]] won the Republican primary. Three months later, Ryan announced his withdrawal from the race four days after the [[Chicago Tribune]] persuaded a California court to release records from Ryan's divorce case, which included allegations that Ryan had pressured his then-wife actress [[Jeri Ryan]] to perform sexual acts in public.

Six weeks later, the Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate. The election was the first for the U.S. Senate in which both major party candidates were [[African American]]. Obama won by 43%, the largest margin of victory in the state history of U.S. Senate elections, and served in the Senate for four years until he was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected President]] in 2008. The inequality in the candidates spending for the fall elections – $14,244,768 by Obama and $2,545,325 by Keyes – is also among the largest in history in both [[absolute and relative terms]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 | last=Jacobson | first=Gary C. | title=The First Congressional Elections After BCRA | work=The Election After Reform: Money, Politics and the Bipartisan Campaign RDUNIAt | publisher=Rowman and Littlefield | isbn=978-0742538702 | page=[https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 195] | date=March 30, 2006 | accessdate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref>

Obama touted his legislative experience and early public opposition to the [[Iraq War]] to distinguish himself from his Democratic primary rivals. Illinois Comptroller [[Daniel Hynes|Dan Hynes]] won the endorsement of the [[AFL-CIO]].  Obama succeeded in obtaining the support of three of the state's largest and most active member unions: [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees|AFSCME]], [[Service Employees International Union|SEIU]], and the [[American Federation of Teachers|Illinois Federation of Teachers]]. Hynes and multimillionaire former securities trader [[Blair Hull]] each won the endorsements of two of the nine Democratic Illinois members of the US House of Representatives. Obama had the endorsements of four: [[Jesse Jackson, Jr.]], [[Danny K. Davis|Danny Davis]], [[Lane Evans]], and [[Jan Schakowsky]].

Obama surged into the lead after he finally began television advertising in Chicago in the final three weeks of the campaign, which was expanded to [[downstate Illinois]] during the last six days of the campaign. The ads included strong endorsements by the five largest newspapers in Illinois—the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'', ''[[The Rockford Register Star]]'', and ''[[Peoria Journal Star]]''—and a testimonial by [[Sheila Simon]] that Obama was \"cut from that same cloth\" as her father, the late former U.S. Senator [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]], who had planned to endorse and campaign for Obama before his unexpected death in December 2003.<ref name=\"Simon\"/>

=== Results ===
On March 16, 2004, Obama won the Democratic primary by an unexpected landslide—receiving 53% of the vote, 29% ahead of his nearest Democratic rival, with a vote total that nearly equaled that of all eight Republican candidates combined—which overnight made him a rising star in the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, ''[[Dreams from My Father]]''.<ref name=\"future\"/><ref name=\"book\"/> The Democratic primary election, including seven candidates who combined to spend over $46 million, was the most expensive U.S. Senate primary election in history.

GOP frontrunner Jack Ryan had divorced actress [[Jeri Ryan]] in 1999, and the records of the divorce were sealed at their mutual request. Five years later, when Ryan's Senate campaign began, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper and [[WLS-TV]], the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, sought to have the records released.  On March 3, 2004, several of Ryan's GOP primary opponents urged Ryan to release the records.<ref>Fornek, Scott; Herrmann, Andrew.

=== Obama vs. Ryan ===
As a result of the GOP and Democratic primaries, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] was pitted against Republican [[Jack Ryan (politician)|Jack Ryan]].

Ryan trailed Obama in early polls, after the media reported that Ryan had assigned Justin Warfel, a Ryan campaign worker, to track Obama's appearances.<ref name=\"Mendell\">{{Cite news | first=David | last=Mendell | title=Ryan aide to give Obama more space | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/chi-0405230433may23,1,3572265.story | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=May 23, 2004 | accessdate=February 11, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205204729/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/chi-0405230433may23,1,3572265.story | archivedate=December 5, 2007 | url-status=dead | df=mdy }}</ref> The tactic backfired when many people, including Ryan's supporters, criticized this activity.  Ryan's spokesman apologized, and promised that Warfel would give Obama more space.  Obama acknowledged that it is standard practice to film an opponent in public, and Obama said he was satisfied with Ryan's decision to have Warfel back off.<ref name=\"Mendell\" />

As the campaign progressed, the lawsuit brought by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' to open [[Child custody laws in the United States|child custody]] files from Ryan's divorce was still continuing. Barack Obama's backers emailed reporters about the divorce controversy, but refrained from on-the-record commentary.<ref name=\"Fornek\" /> On March 29, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Schnider ruled that several of the Ryans' divorce records should be opened to the public, and ruled that a court-appointed referee would later decide which custody files should remain sealed to protect the interests of Ryan's young child.<ref>Ford, Liam.  [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/chi-0403300182mar30,1,7640086.story “Some Ryan divorce files should be unsealed”], ''Chicago Tribune'' (March 30, 2004).</ref> A few days later, on April 2, 2004, Barack Obama changed his position about the Ryans' soon-to-be-released divorce records, and called on Democrats to not inject them into the campaign.<ref name=\"Fornek\">Fornek, Scott.

On June 22, 2004, after receiving the report from the court appointed referee, the judge released the files that were deemed consistent with the interests of Ryan's young child. In those files, [[Jeri Ryan]] alleged that Jack Ryan had taken her to sex clubs in several cities, intending for them to have sex in public.<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{Cite news | first=Stephen | last=Kinzer | authorlink=Stephen Kinzer |author2=Jo Napolitano  | title=Illinois Senate Campaign Thrown Into Prurient Turmoil | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E3D71039F930A15755C0A9629C8B63&scp=1&sq=Jack+Ryan+Jeri+Ryan&st=nyt | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 23, 2004 | accessdate=February 10, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/20040622-0304-illinoissenate.html | title=Illinois Republican vows to stay in Senate race despite embarrassing allegations  | accessdate=August 12, 2007 | date=June 22, 2004 | author=Lannan, Maura Kelly | work=SignOnSanDiego.com | publisher=Associated Press}}</ref>

The decision to release the files generated much controversy because it went against both parents' direct request, and because it reversed the earlier decision to seal the papers in the best interest of the child. Jim Oberweis, Ryan's defeated GOP opponent, commented that \"these are allegations made in a divorce hearing, and we all know people tend to say things that aren't necessarily true in divorce proceedings when there is money involved and custody of children involved.\"<ref name=\"nyt1\" />

Although their [[sensationalism|sensational nature]] made the revelations fodder for [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] and television programs specializing in such stories, the files were also newsworthy because of questions about whether Ryan had accurately described the documents to GOP party leaders.  Prior to release of the documents, Ryan had told leading Republicans that five percent of the divorce file could cause problems for his campaign.<ref>Martinez, Michael; Pearson, Rick.  [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0406180364jun18,1,3423709.story “Court sets release of Ryan's divorce file”], Chicago Tribune (June 18, 2004).</ref> But after the documents were released, GOP officials including state GOP Chair [[Judy Baar Topinka]] said they felt Ryan had misleadingly indicated the divorce records would not be embarrassing.<ref>Pearson, Rick; Ford, Liam.

That charge of dishonesty led to intensifying calls for Ryan's withdrawal, though Topinka, who was considering running herself, said after the June 25 withdrawal that Ryan's \"decision was a personal one\" and that the state GOP had not pressured Ryan to drop out.<ref>Ford, Liam; Bush, Rudolph. [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0406260116jun26,1,277974.story?coll=chi-news-hed “Ryan Quits Race”], Chicago Tribune June 26, 2004.</ref>  Ryan's campaign ended less than a week after the custody records were opened, and Ryan officially filed the documentation to withdraw on July 29, 2004.  Obama was left without an opponent.

=== Obama vs. Keyes ===
The Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate after former governor [[Jim Edgar]], state treasurer [[Judy Baar Topinka]] and former [[Chicago Bears]] head coach [[Mike Ditka]] declined to run.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 14, 2004|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ditka-spikes-illinois-senate-run/|title=Ditka Spikes Illinois Senate Run|website=[[CBS News]]}}</ref> Keyes, a [[American conservatism|conservative Republican]], faced an uphill battle. First, Keyes, a native of Maryland, had almost no ties to Illinois. He unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Maryland twice, losing in landslides both times, and had made unsuccessful bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and 2000.<ref>{{cite web|date=August 9, 2004|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/08/senate.illinois.keyes/index.html|title=Keyes challenges Obama for Illinois Senate seat|website=[[CNN]]}}</ref>. Second, the lack of a serious opponent allowed Obama to campaign throughout the more conservative downstate regions to build up name recognition. Third, Keyes was seen as a [[parachute candidate]], only establishing legal residency in [[Calumet City, Illinois]] days before running.

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in an [[editorial]], stated that \"Mr. Keyes may have noticed a large body of water as he flew into [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]]. That is called [[Lake Michigan]].\"<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-08-06/news/0408060313_1_mr-keyes-judy-baar-topinka-alan-keyes | title=Commentary: The GOP's rent-a-senator  | accessdate=January 21, 2013 | date=August 6, 2004 | publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> In 2000, Keyes attacked [[Hillary Clinton]] for running for US Senator from New York even though she had never lived there, calling her a carpetbagger.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/opinion/10tue2.html | title=Plan B for Illinois | date= August 10, 2004 | work= The New York Times | accessdate= December 25, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111228091458/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/opinion/10tue2.html | archivedate=December 28, 2011 }}</ref> Keyes attacked Barack Obama for voting against a bill that would have outlawed a form of late-term abortion.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Robinson | first=Mike | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5654128 | title=Keyes assails Obama's abortion views | publisher=NBC News | work=The Associated Press | accessdate=December 27, 2009 | date=August 9, 2004}}</ref>

Race became an issue in the contest between the two black candidates when Keyes claimed that he, not Obama, was the true \"African-American\".  Indeed there were a handful of black spokesmen who did not consider Obama to be African-American.  The black voters of Illinois voted 92% for Obama.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Omiunota N.

Obama ran the most successful Senate campaign in 2004, and was so far ahead in polls that he soon began to campaign outside of Illinois in support of other Democratic candidates. He gave large sums of campaign funds to other candidates and the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] and sent many of his volunteers to work on other races, including that of eventual three-term Congresswoman [[Melissa Bean]] who defeated then-Congressman [[Phil Crane]] in that year's election. Obama and Keyes differed on many issues including [[education voucher|school vouchers]] and tax cuts, both of which Keyes supported and Obama opposed.<ref>Alan Keyes Archives, [http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm 2004 Illinois Debates] {{Webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225055002/http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm | date=February 25, 2007 }}</ref>

The Obama-Keyes race was one of the first to be called on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], November 2, 2004.

At the start of Keyes' candidacy in August, Keyes had 24% support in the [[opinion poll|polls]]. He received 27% of the vote in the November general election to Obama's 70%.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/IL/S/01/index.html | title= America Votes 2004: U.S. Senate/Illinois  | accessdate=August 12, 2007 | work=CNN}}</ref>

Following the [[election]], Keyes refused to call Obama to congratulate him. Media reports claimed that Keyes also failed to concede the race to Obama.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/keyes-concedes-race-says-obama-stands-evil-culture/|title=Keyes concedes race, says Obama stands for 'evil' culture - Lewiston Sun Journal|date=2004-11-06|work=Lewiston Sun Journal|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}</ref> Two days after the election, a radio interviewer asked Keyes whether he had conceded the race. Keyes replied, \"Of course I've conceded the race. I mean, I gave my speech to that effect.\"<ref name=\"radio\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.keyesarchives.com/transcript.php?id=377 | title=Alan Keyes on the Scott Thomas Show, WYLL  | accessdate=August 12, 2007 | date=November 4, 2004 | author=Thomas, Scott | work=Allan Keyes Archives}}</ref>

On the radio program, Keyes explained that his refusal to congratulate Obama was \"not anything personal,\" but was meant to make a statement against \"extend[ing] false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line.\" He said that Obama's position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line. \"I'm supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward the triumph of that which I believe ultimately stands for... a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country? I can't do this. And I will not make a false gesture,\" Keyes said.<ref name=\"radio\" />

Obama would go on to be elected [[President of the United States]] in 2008.

The '''2004 United States Senate election in Illinois''' was held on November 2, 2004. [[Incumbent]] Republican U.S. Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (politician)|Peter Fitzgerald]] decided to retire after one term. The Democratic and Republican [[primary election]]s were held in March, which included a total of 15 candidates who combined to spend a record total of over $60 million seeking the [[open seat]].

On March 16, 2004, State Senator [[Barack Obama]] won the Democratic primary, and businessman [[Jack Ryan (politician)|Jack Ryan]] won the Republican primary. Three months later, Ryan announced his withdrawal from the race four days after the [[Chicago Tribune]] persuaded a California court to release records from Ryan's divorce case, which included allegations that Ryan had pressured his then-wife actress [[Jeri Ryan]] to perform sexual acts in public.

Six weeks later, the Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate. The election was the first for the U.S. Senate in which both major party candidates were [[African American]]. Obama won by 43%, the largest margin of victory in the state history of U.S. Senate elections, and served in the Senate for four years until he was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected President]] in 2008. The inequality in the candidates spending for the fall elections – $14,244,768 by Obama and $2,545,325 by Keyes – is also among the largest in history in both [[absolute and relative terms]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 | last=Jacobson | first=Gary C. | title=The First Congressional Elections After BCRA | work=The Election After Reform: Money, Politics and the Bipartisan Campaign RDUNIAt | publisher=Rowman and Littlefield | isbn=978-0742538702 | page=[https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 195] | date=March 30, 2006 | accessdate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref>

Obama touted his legislative experience and early public opposition to the [[Iraq War]] to distinguish himself from his Democratic primary rivals. Illinois Comptroller [[Daniel Hynes|Dan Hynes]] won the endorsement of the [[AFL-CIO]].  Obama succeeded in obtaining the support of three of the state's largest and most active member unions: [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees|AFSCME]], [[Service Employees International Union|SEIU]], and the [[American Federation of Teachers|Illinois Federation of Teachers]]. Hynes and multimillionaire former securities trader [[Blair Hull]] each won the endorsements of two of the nine Democratic Illinois members of the US House of Representatives. Obama had the endorsements of four: [[Jesse Jackson, Jr.]], [[Danny K. Davis|Danny Davis]], [[Lane Evans]], and [[Jan Schakowsky]].

Obama surged into the lead after he finally began television advertising in Chicago in the final three weeks of the campaign, which was expanded to [[downstate Illinois]] during the last six days of the campaign. The ads included strong endorsements by the five largest newspapers in Illinois—the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'', ''[[The Rockford Register Star]]'', and ''[[Peoria Journal Star]]''—and a testimonial by [[Sheila Simon]] that Obama was \"cut from that same cloth\" as her father, the late former U.S. Senator [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]], who had planned to endorse and campaign for Obama before his unexpected death in December 2003.<ref name=\"Simon\"/>

=== Results ===
On March 16, 2004, Obama won the Democratic primary by an unexpected landslide—receiving 53% of the vote, 29% ahead of his nearest Democratic rival, with a vote total that nearly equaled that of all eight Republican candidates combined—which overnight made him a rising star in the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, ''[[Dreams from My Father]]''.<ref name=\"future\"/><ref name=\"book\"/> The Democratic primary election, including seven candidates who combined to spend over $46 million, was the most expensive U.S. Senate primary election in history.

=== Campaign ===
GOP frontrunner Jack Ryan had divorced actress [[Jeri Ryan]] in 1999, and the records of the divorce were sealed at their mutual request. Five years later, when Ryan's Senate campaign began, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper and [[WLS-TV]], the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, sought to have the records released.  On March 3, 2004, several of Ryan's GOP primary opponents urged Ryan to release the records.<ref>Fornek, Scott; Herrmann, Andrew.

Ryan went on to win the GOP primary on March 16, 2004 defeating his nearest competitor, Jim Oberweis, by twelve percentage points.<ref>Davey, Monica.

Ryan was a proponent of across-the-board [[tax]] cuts and [[tort reform]], an effort to limit payout in [[medical malpractice]] [[lawsuit]]s. He was also a proponent of [[school choice]] and supported [[vouchers]] for private school students.

Oberweis's 2004 campaign was notable for a television commercial where he flew in a helicopter over Chicago's [[Soldier Field]], and claimed enough illegal immigrants came into America in a week (10,000 a day) to fill the stadium's 61,500 seats.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/jobs/promo/chi-0402250162feb25,0,5406125.story | title=Oberweis ads rile immigrant groups | work=Chicago Tribune |first1=Liam |last1=Ford |first2=Oscar |last2=Avila | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906115543/http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/jobs/promo/chi-0402250162feb25,0,5406125.story | archivedate=September 6, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/beaconnews/news/653706,2_1_AU16_OBERWEIS_S1.article | title=Oberweis: hard line on immigration | author=Andres Salles | work=The Beacon News | date=November 16, 2007}}</ref> Oberweis was also fined $21,000 by the Federal Election Commission for a commercial for his dairy that ran during his 2004 Senate campaign.

== General election ==

=== Obama vs. Ryan ===
As a result of the GOP and Democratic primaries, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] was pitted against Republican [[Jack Ryan (politician)|Jack Ryan]].

Ryan trailed Obama in early polls, after the media reported that Ryan had assigned Justin Warfel, a Ryan campaign worker, to track Obama's appearances.<ref name=\"Mendell\">{{Cite news | first=David | last=Mendell | title=Ryan aide to give Obama more space | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/chi-0405230433may23,1,3572265.story | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=May 23, 2004 | accessdate=February 11, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205204729/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/chi-0405230433may23,1,3572265.story | archivedate=December 5, 2007 | url-status=dead | df=mdy }}</ref> The tactic backfired when many people, including Ryan's supporters, criticized this activity.  Ryan's spokesman apologized, and promised that Warfel would give Obama more space.  Obama acknowledged that it is standard practice to film an opponent in public, and Obama said he was satisfied with Ryan's decision to have Warfel back off.<ref name=\"Mendell\" />

As the campaign progressed, the lawsuit brought by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' to open [[Child custody laws in the United States|child custody]] files from Ryan's divorce was still continuing. Barack Obama's backers emailed reporters about the divorce controversy, but refrained from on-the-record commentary.<ref name=\"Fornek\" /> On March 29, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Schnider ruled that several of the Ryans' divorce records should be opened to the public, and ruled that a court-appointed referee would later decide which custody files should remain sealed to protect the interests of Ryan's young child.<ref>Ford, Liam.  [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/chi-0403300182mar30,1,7640086.story “Some Ryan divorce files should be unsealed”], ''Chicago Tribune'' (March 30, 2004).</ref> A few days later, on April 2, 2004, Barack Obama changed his position about the Ryans' soon-to-be-released divorce records, and called on Democrats to not inject them into the campaign.<ref name=\"Fornek\">Fornek, Scott.  [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=(Obama:%20Back%20off%20divorce%20files)%20AND%20date(4/3/2004%20to%204/3/2004)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=4/3/2004%20to%204/3/2004)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Obama:%20Back%20off%20divorce%20files)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no \"Obama: Back off divorce files\"], ''Chicago Sun-Times''  (April 3, 2004).</ref>

On June 22, 2004, after receiving the report from the court appointed referee, the judge released the files that were deemed consistent with the interests of Ryan's young child. In those files, [[Jeri Ryan]] alleged that Jack Ryan had taken her to sex clubs in several cities, intending for them to have sex in public.<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{Cite news | first=Stephen | last=Kinzer | authorlink=Stephen Kinzer |author2=Jo Napolitano  | title=Illinois Senate Campaign Thrown Into Prurient Turmoil | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E3D71039F930A15755C0A9629C8B63&scp=1&sq=Jack+Ryan+Jeri+Ryan&st=nyt | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 23, 2004 | accessdate=February 10, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/20040622-0304-illinoissenate.html | title=Illinois Republican vows to stay in Senate race despite embarrassing allegations  | accessdate=August 12, 2007 | date=June 22, 2004 | author=Lannan, Maura Kelly | work=SignOnSanDiego.com | publisher=Associated Press}}</ref>

The decision to release the files generated much controversy because it went against both parents' direct request, and because it reversed the earlier decision to seal the papers in the best interest of the child. Jim Oberweis, Ryan's defeated GOP opponent, commented that \"these are allegations made in a divorce hearing, and we all know people tend to say things that aren't necessarily true in divorce proceedings when there is money involved and custody of children involved.\"<ref name=\"nyt1\" />

Although their [[sensationalism|sensational nature]] made the revelations fodder for [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] and television programs specializing in such stories, the files were also newsworthy because of questions about whether Ryan had accurately described the documents to GOP party leaders.  Prior to release of the documents, Ryan had told leading Republicans that five percent of the divorce file could cause problems for his campaign.<ref>Martinez, Michael; Pearson, Rick.  [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0406180364jun18,1,3423709.story “Court sets release of Ryan's divorce file”], Chicago Tribune (June 18, 2004).</ref> But after the documents were released, GOP officials including state GOP Chair [[Judy Baar Topinka]] said they felt Ryan had misleadingly indicated the divorce records would not be embarrassing.<ref>Pearson, Rick; Ford, Liam.  [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0406230356jun23,1,998870.story?coll=chi-homepagepromo451-fea “GOP leaders say they felt misled on Ryan file”], Chicago Tribune (June 23, 2004).</ref>

That charge of dishonesty led to intensifying calls for Ryan's withdrawal, though Topinka, who was considering running herself, said after the June 25 withdrawal that Ryan's \"decision was a personal one\" and that the state GOP had not pressured Ryan to drop out.<ref>Ford, Liam; Bush, Rudolph. [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0406260116jun26,1,277974.story?coll=chi-news-hed “Ryan Quits Race”], Chicago Tribune June 26, 2004.</ref>  Ryan's campaign ended less than a week after the custody records were opened, and Ryan officially filed the documentation to withdraw on July 29, 2004.  Obama was left without an opponent.

=== Obama vs. Keyes ===
The Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate after former governor [[Jim Edgar]], state treasurer [[Judy Baar Topinka]] and former [[Chicago Bears]] head coach [[Mike Ditka]] declined to run.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 14, 2004|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ditka-spikes-illinois-senate-run/|title=Ditka Spikes Illinois Senate Run|website=[[CBS News]]}}</ref> Keyes, a [[American conservatism|conservative Republican]], faced an uphill battle. First, Keyes, a native of Maryland, had almost no ties to Illinois. He unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Maryland twice, losing in landslides both times, and had made unsuccessful bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and 2000.<ref>{{cite web|date=August 9, 2004|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/08/senate.illinois.keyes/index.html|title=Keyes challenges Obama for Illinois Senate seat|website=[[CNN]]}}</ref>. Second, the lack of a serious opponent allowed Obama to campaign throughout the more conservative downstate regions to build up name recognition. Third, Keyes was seen as a [[carpetbagger]], only establishing legal residency in [[Calumet City, Illinois]] days before running.

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in an [[editorial]], stated that \"Mr. Keyes may have noticed a large body of water as he flew into [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]]. That is called [[Lake Michigan]].\"<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-08-06/news/0408060313_1_mr-keyes-judy-baar-topinka-alan-keyes | title=Commentary: The GOP's rent-a-senator  | accessdate=January 21, 2013 | date=August 6, 2004 | publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> In 2000, Keyes attacked [[Hillary Clinton]] for running for US Senator from New York even though she had never lived there, calling her a carpetbagger.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/opinion/10tue2.html | title=Plan B for Illinois | date= August 10, 2004 | work= The New York Times | accessdate= December 25, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111228091458/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/opinion/10tue2.html | archivedate=December 28, 2011 }}</ref> Keyes attacked Barack Obama for voting against a bill that would have outlawed a form of late-term abortion.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Robinson | first=Mike | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5654128 | title=Keyes assails Obama's abortion views | publisher=NBC News | work=The Associated Press | accessdate=December 27, 2009 | date=August 9, 2004}}</ref>

Race became an issue in the contest between the two black candidates when Keyes claimed that he, not Obama, was the true \"African-American\".  Indeed there were a handful of black spokesmen who did not consider Obama to be African-American.  The black voters of Illinois voted 92% for Obama.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Omiunota N.

Obama ran the most successful Senate campaign in 2004, and was so far ahead in polls that he soon began to campaign outside of Illinois in support of other Democratic candidates. He gave large sums of campaign funds to other candidates and the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] and sent many of his volunteers to work on other races, including that of eventual three-term Congresswoman [[Melissa Bean]] who defeated then-Congressman [[Phil Crane]] in that year's election. Obama and Keyes differed on many issues including [[education voucher|school vouchers]] and tax cuts, both of which Keyes supported and Obama opposed.<ref>Alan Keyes Archives, [http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm 2004 Illinois Debates] {{Webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225055002/http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm | date=February 25, 2007 }}</ref>

The Obama-Keyes race was one of the first to be called on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], November 2, 2004.

At the start of Keyes' candidacy in August, Keyes had 24% support in the [[opinion poll|polls]]. He received 27% of the vote in the November general election to Obama's 70%.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/IL/S/01/index.html | title= America Votes 2004: U.S. Senate/Illinois  | accessdate=August 12, 2007 | work=CNN}}</ref>

Following the [[election]], Keyes refused to call Obama to congratulate him. Media reports claimed that Keyes also failed to concede the race to Obama.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/keyes-concedes-race-says-obama-stands-evil-culture/|title=Keyes concedes race, says Obama stands for 'evil' culture - Lewiston Sun Journal|date=2004-11-06|work=Lewiston Sun Journal|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}</ref> Two days after the election, a radio interviewer asked Keyes whether he had conceded the race. Keyes replied, \"Of course I've conceded the race. I mean, I gave my speech to that effect.\"<ref name=\"radio\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.keyesarchives.com/transcript.php?id=377 | title=Alan Keyes on the Scott Thomas Show, WYLL  | accessdate=August 12, 2007 | date=November 4, 2004 | author=Thomas, Scott | work=Allan Keyes Archives}}</ref>

On the radio program, Keyes explained that his refusal to congratulate Obama was \"not anything personal,\" but was meant to make a statement against \"extend[ing] false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line.\" He said that Obama's position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line. \"I'm supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward the triumph of that which I believe ultimately stands for... a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country? I can't do this. And I will not make a false gesture,\" Keyes said.<ref name=\"radio\" />

Obama would go on to be elected [[President of the United States]] in 2008.

'''Hove''' {{IPAc-en|h|oʊ|v}} is a [[seaside resort]] in the county of [[East Sussex]], and a constituent part of the [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] of [[Brighton and Hove]]. Originally a \"small but ancient fishing village\" surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton, and by the [[Victorian era]] it was a fully developed town with borough status.  Neighbouring parishes such as [[Aldrington]] and [[Hangleton]] were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1997, as part of [[1990s United Kingdom local government reform|local government reform]], the borough merged with [[Brighton]] to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove, and this unitary authority was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.

==Name and etymology==
Old spellings of Hove include Hou ([[Domesday Book]], 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675).<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp265-268|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7, the Rape of Lewes.  The Borough of Hove|last=Salzman|first=L.F. (ed.)|authorlink=Louis Francis Salzman|year=1940|work=[[Victoria County History]] of Sussex|publisher=[[British History Online]]|pages=265–268|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 89.}}</ref>  The etymology was disputed at length during the 20th century as academics offered several competing theories.  Suggestions included an [[Old Norse]] word meaning \"hall\", \"sanctuary\" or \"[[Tumulus|barrow]]\", in reference to the [[Bronze Age]] barrow near the present [[Palmeira Square]]; an [[Old English]] phrase ''aet thaem hofe'' meaning \"at the hall\";{{#tag:ref|This suggestion was given in ''[https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofsuss00robeiala/placenamesofsuss00robeiala_djvu.txt The Place-Names of Sussex]'' (1914) by R.G. Roberts.|group=note}} the Old English ''hufe'' meaning \"shelter\" or \"covering\"; and the [[Middle English]] ''hofe'' meaning \"anchorage\".  No other places in Britain are called Hove, and single-syllable names as a whole are rare in Sussex.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  The modern name was originally pronounced \"Hoove\" ({{IPAc-en|'|h|uː|v}}).  The present pronunciation ({{IPAc-en|'|h|oʊ|v}}) \"is comparatively recent\".<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p69\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 69.}}</ref>

==Geography and topography==
[[File:Hove Lawns - geograph.org.uk - 1326650.jpg|thumb|Hove Lawns is a large sea front garden situated to the west of the main Hove Esplanade]]
Northern parts of Hove are built on [[chalk]] beds, part of the [[Chalk Group#White Chalk Subgroup|White Chalk Subgroup]] found across southeast England.  There are also extensive areas of clay and sandy soil: areas of [[Woolwich Formation]] and [[Reading Formation]] clay, pockets of clay embedded with [[flint]], and a large deposit of [[brickearth]] in the Aldrington area.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  Hove's beaches are entirely [[Shingle beach|shingle]] and have the characteristics of a [[storm beach]].<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 90.}}</ref>  The [[Metres above sea level|mean height above sea level]] of land in the old parish of Hove varied between {{convert|22|ft|m}} to {{convert|190|ft|m}}.  After Hove became a borough and expanded to incorporate land from neighbouring parishes, the highest point was approximately {{convert|590|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\"/>  There are no rivers in Hove, but Westbourne Gardens at the western boundary of the old parish is named after the \"West [[Bourne (stream)|Bourne]]\", which was still visible in the 19th century but which now runs underground, and a map of 1588 shows another stream called East Brook.<ref name=\"ASON1\">{{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=1.}}</ref>

Until the 19th century the {{convert|778|acre|ha|adj=on}} parish was mostly agricultural.  Three farms—Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn—dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] described it as \"uncommonly rich\".  Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1–2\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1–2.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Middleton10–11\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=10–11.}}</ref>  The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as ''Hove Drove'' and led on to the Downs.  A long west–east route which crossed [[West Blatchington]], Hove and Preston parishes on its way to [[Lewes]] now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove.  The section called The Droveway, on which the [[British Engineerium|Goldstone Waterworks]] was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when [[Hove Park]] was built.  A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer's Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv4p34–36\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 4, pp. 34–36.}}</ref>

A large [[Sarsen]] stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of [[Hove Park]].  Links with druids were claimed; and some 19th-century sources stated it was part of a ring of stones similar to [[Stonehenge]], and that the others were buried in a pond at Goldstone Bottom, one of the [[Combe|coombes]] (small dry valleys) between the Downs and the sea.<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\"/><ref name=\"Middleton28\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=28.}}</ref>  The Goldstone was dug up and buried by a farmer, but was unearthed and re-erected in a new position in the park{{#tag:ref|At {{coord|50.839433|-0.173735}}|group=note}} in 1906.<ref name=\"Middleton29\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=29.}}</ref>

Hove has little ancient woodland. Only two small areas survive: one in [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]], and The Three Cornered Copse in the Tongdean area.

== History and development ==

=== Pre-Roman evidence ===
Fossilised remains from the [[Pleistocene]] era have been found in three locations in Hove: an {{convert|11|lb|2|oz|kg|adj=on}} [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] from ''[[Straight-tusked elephant|Elephas antiquus]]'', excavated from the garden of a house in Poplar Avenue; teeth from a juvenile elephant deep in the soil at Ventnor Villas; and a prehistoric horse's tooth in the soil near Hove Street.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p78\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 78.}}</ref>

During building work near [[Palmeira Square]] in 1856–57, workmen levelled a substantial burial mound.<ref name=\"Middleton51\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=51.}}</ref> A prominent feature of the landscape since 1200 BC,{{#tag:ref|[[Radiocarbon dating]] dated the coffin inside the burial mound to 1239 BC.<ref name=\"Middleton49\"/>|group=note}} the {{convert|20|ft|m}}-high tumulus<ref name=\"Middleton49\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=49.}}</ref> yielded, among other treasures, the [[Hove amber cup]]. Made of translucent red Baltic amber and approximately the same size as a regular china tea cup, the artefact can be seen in the [[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]].  Only one other has been found in Britain.  Also buried in the coffin in which the amber cup was found were a stone battle-axe, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] and a bronze dagger whose appearance is characteristic of the [[Wessex culture]].<ref name=\"Middleton51\"/>

=== Domesday Book ===
There are entries for Brighton and Portslade (Bristelmestune and Porteslage) and small downland settlements like Hangleton (Hangetone), but nothing for the location of Hove itself.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
The first known settlement in Hove was around the 12th century when [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was established. Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north–south some 250&nbsp;m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.
[[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] is a well-preserved 16th-century [[flint]] manor building. It is believed to have been built c. 1540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice [[High Sheriff of Sussex]], whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.

===18th century===
In 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.

In 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>

=== Regency and Victorian developments ===
The census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.

Also at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.

The fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.

In the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.

Dating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.

The Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of £1 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.

By 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.

[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794–1845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.

The flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].

Two further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.

West of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].

Hove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O’Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, p.37</ref>

The [[Hove Club]], a private members' club located at 28 Fourth Avenue, was founded in 1882.<ref name=\"The Hove Club: About Us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehoveclub.com/about-us-1/|title=The Hove Club - About Us|website=thehoveclub.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015200045/http://www.thehoveclub.com/about-us-1/|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"The Hove Club: Contact Us\">[http://www.thehoveclub.com/contact-us/ The Hove Club: Contact Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110142240/http://www.thehoveclub.com/contact-us/ |date=10 November 2013 }}</ref>

===First World War===
[[File:Hove War Memorial (04).JPG|thumb|[[Hove War Memorial]] on Grand Avenue]]
{{main|Hove War Memorial}}
Over 600 men from Hove were killed in the First World War. After the armistice, the town established a war memorial committee to decide on commemoration of the dead. The committee commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], the architect responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on London's Whitehall which became the focus of [[national memory|national remembrance]] services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1187556 |desc=Hove War Memorial|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Tim|last2=Gliddon|first2=Gerald|title=Lutyens and the Great War|year=2008|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=9780711228788|pages=75, 169}}</ref>

==Governance and politics==

===Coat of arms===
While it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own [[coat of arms]].  The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon's]] official heraldic description is \"Tierced in [[Pall (heraldry)|pairle]]: 1. [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] a [[Saltire#Heraldry|saltire]] [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] voided [[argent]]; 2. [[Gules]] two pairs of leg-irons interlaced argent; 3. [[Check (pattern)|Checky]] or and azure three [[martlet]]s or, all in a [[Bordure|border]] [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with six martlets or\".  The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove's history.  The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest.  The [[saltire]] of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the leg-shackles of [[Leonard of Noblac]] refer to the ancient [[parish church]]es of Hove and [[Aldrington]], [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's]] and [[St Leonard's Church, Aldrington|St Leonard's]] respectively.  [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey]] held land in the [[Rape of Lewes]] at the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] including the territory covered by Hove; his colours were blue and gold, represented by the chequerboard pattern in the background of the shield.<ref name=\"Willy32\">{{Harvnb|Willy|1978|p=32.}}</ref>

== Commercial ==
The town centre received substantial renovation in the late 1990s when the popular George Street was pedestrianised. Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>

== Transport ==
{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}

Hove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.

Hove has three railway stations. [[Hove railway station]] has direct access to the [[Brighton main line]] to London via a loop eliminating the need to go through [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.

Branching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.

== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==
[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]

== Education ==
Hove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School. There are four [[secondary school]]s serving the area: [[Blatchington Mill School and Sixth Form College|Blatchington Mill School]], [[Cardinal Newman Catholic School, Hove|Cardinal Newman Catholic School]], [[Hove Park School]] and [[King's School, Hove|King's School]].

[[Brighton Hove & Sussex Sixth Form College|Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College]] (BHASVIC), formerly Brighton, Hove & Sussex Grammar School, is a dedicated place of [[further education]], along with the Connaught Centre, Hove Park Sixth Form Centre and Blatchington Mill Sixth Form College.

Brighton is also home to private colleges such as [http://www.hovecollege.co.uk/ Hove College]  Founded in 1977, Hove College is a non-profit private higher education institution and offers accredited courses by [http://www.ocnlondon.org.uk/ OCN London] Hove College neighbors with [[British Study Centres School of English|British Study Centres]] and kindergarten schools. Hove College is 5 to 10 mins of walking distance from [[Palmeira Square|Palmeria Square.]]

Hove is also the location of a number of [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]] including [[Deepdene School]], Lancing College Preparatory School (formerly Mowden School) The Montessori Place, [[The Drive Prep School]] and St Christopher's School (now part of Brighton College). Hove is also home for several schools for foreign students of the English language.

== Sport and leisure ==
The home of [[Sussex County Cricket Club]] is at [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]]. It is used for county, national and international matches, music concerts, fireworks displays, and has found resurgent popularity with the introduction of [[Twenty20]].

Until 1997 Hove was home to the [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.]]'s [[Goldstone Ground]]. In September 2007, planning permission was confirmed for the club's new ground, at [[Falmer]], still within the city limits but on the Brighton side. The new stadium started development in late 2008, with the first game being played in August 2011.

[[Brighton & Hove Hockey Club]] is a [[field hockey]] club and its home ground is based in Hove.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightonandhovehockeyclub.net/how_to_find_us/ |title=How To Find Us |accessdate=2013-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214221927/http://www.brightonandhovehockeyclub.net/how_to_find_us/ |archivedate=14 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

'''Hove''' {{IPAc-en|h|oʊ|v}} is a [[seaside resort]] in the county of [[East Sussex]], and a constituent part of the [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] of [[Brighton and Hove]]. Originally a \"small but ancient fishing village\" surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton, and by the [[Victorian era]] it was a fully developed town with borough status.  Neighbouring parishes such as [[Aldrington]] and [[Hangleton]] were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1997, as part of [[1990s United Kingdom local government reform|local government reform]], the borough merged with [[Brighton]] to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove, and this unitary authority was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.

==Name and etymology==
Old spellings of Hove include Hou ([[Domesday Book]], 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675).<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp265-268|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7, the Rape of Lewes.

Suggestions included an [[Old Norse]] word meaning \"hall\", \"sanctuary\" or \"[[Tumulus|barrow]]\", in reference to the [[Bronze Age]] barrow near the present [[Palmeira Square]]; an [[Old English]] phrase ''aet thaem hofe'' meaning \"at the hall\";{{#tag:ref|This suggestion was given in ''[https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofsuss00robeiala/placenamesofsuss00robeiala_djvu.txt The Place-Names of Sussex]'' (1914) by R.G. Roberts.|group=note}} the Old English ''hufe'' meaning \"shelter\" or \"covering\"; and the [[Middle English]] ''hofe'' meaning \"anchorage\".  No other places in Britain are called Hove, and single-syllable names as a whole are rare in Sussex.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  The modern name was originally pronounced \"Hoove\" ({{IPAc-en|'|h|uː|v}}).  The present pronunciation ({{IPAc-en|'|h|oʊ|v}}) \"is comparatively recent\".<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p69\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 69.}}</ref>

==Geography and topography==
[[File:Hove Lawns - geograph.org.uk - 1326650.jpg|thumb|Hove Lawns is a large sea front garden situated to the west of the main Hove Esplanade]]
Northern parts of Hove are built on [[chalk]] beds, part of the [[Chalk Group#White Chalk Subgroup|White Chalk Subgroup]] found across southeast England.  There are also extensive areas of clay and sandy soil: areas of [[Woolwich Formation]] and [[Reading Formation]] clay, pockets of clay embedded with [[flint]], and a large deposit of [[brickearth]] in the Aldrington area.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  Hove's beaches are entirely [[Shingle beach|shingle]] and have the characteristics of a [[storm beach]].<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 90.}}</ref>  The [[Metres above sea level|mean height above sea level]] of land in the old parish of Hove varied between {{convert|22|ft|m}} to {{convert|190|ft|m}}.  After Hove became a borough and expanded to incorporate land from neighbouring parishes, the highest point was approximately {{convert|590|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\"/>  There are no rivers in Hove, but Westbourne Gardens at the western boundary of the old parish is named after the \"West [[Bourne (stream)|Bourne]]\", which was still visible in the 19th century but which now runs underground, and a map of 1588 shows another stream called East Brook.<ref name=\"ASON1\">{{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=1.}}</ref>

Until the 19th century the {{convert|778|acre|ha|adj=on}} parish was mostly agricultural.  Three farms—Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn—dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] described it as \"uncommonly rich\".  Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1–2\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1–2.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Middleton10–11\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=10–11.}}</ref>  The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as ''Hove Drove'' and led on to the Downs.  A long west–east route which crossed [[West Blatchington]], Hove and Preston parishes on its way to [[Lewes]] now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove.  The section called The Droveway, on which the [[British Engineerium|Goldstone Waterworks]] was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when [[Hove Park]] was built.  A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer's Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv4p34–36\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 4, pp. 34–36.}}</ref>

A large [[Sarsen]] stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of [[Hove Park]].  Links with druids were claimed; and some 19th-century sources stated it was part of a ring of stones similar to [[Stonehenge]], and that the others were buried in a pond at Goldstone Bottom, one of the [[Combe|coombes]] (small dry valleys) between the Downs and the sea.<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\"/><ref name=\"Middleton28\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=28.}}</ref>  The Goldstone was dug up and buried by a farmer, but was unearthed and re-erected in a new position in the park{{#tag:ref|At {{coord|50.839433|-0.173735}}|group=note}} in 1906.<ref name=\"Middleton29\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=29.}}</ref>

Hove has little ancient woodland. Only two small areas survive: one in [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]], and The Three Cornered Copse in the Tongdean area.  The latter covers {{convert|11|acre|ha}} and belonged to the [[Marquess of Abergavenny]] until Hove Borough Council bought it in January 1935. Trees in the copse include ash, beech, elm and sycamore, although more than 120 mature beech trees were blown down in the Great Storm of 1987.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv14p23\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 14, p. 23.}}</ref>

== History and development ==

=== Pre-Roman evidence ===
Fossilised remains from the [[Pleistocene]] era have been found in three locations in Hove: an {{convert|11|lb|2|oz|kg|adj=on}} [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] from ''[[Straight-tusked elephant|Elephas antiquus]]'', excavated from the garden of a house in Poplar Avenue; teeth from a juvenile elephant deep in the soil at Ventnor Villas; and a prehistoric horse's tooth in the soil near Hove Street.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p78\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 78.}}</ref>

During building work near [[Palmeira Square]] in 1856–57, workmen levelled a substantial burial mound.<ref name=\"Middleton51\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=51.}}</ref> A prominent feature of the landscape since 1200 BC,{{#tag:ref|[[Radiocarbon dating]] dated the coffin inside the burial mound to 1239 BC.<ref name=\"Middleton49\"/>|group=note}} the {{convert|20|ft|m}}-high tumulus<ref name=\"Middleton49\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=49.}}</ref> yielded, among other treasures, the [[Hove amber cup]]. Made of translucent red Baltic amber and approximately the same size as a regular china tea cup, the artefact can be seen in the [[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]].  Only one other has been found in Britain.  Also buried in the coffin in which the amber cup was found were a stone battle-axe, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] and a bronze dagger whose appearance is characteristic of the [[Wessex culture]].<ref name=\"Middleton51\"/>

=== Domesday Book ===
There are entries for Brighton and Portslade (Bristelmestune and Porteslage) and small downland settlements like Hangleton (Hangetone), but nothing for the location of Hove itself.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
The first known settlement in Hove was around the 12th century when [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was established. Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north–south some 250&nbsp;m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.
[[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] is a well-preserved 16th-century [[flint]] manor building. It is believed to have been built c. 1540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice [[High Sheriff of Sussex]], whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.

===18th century===
In 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.

In 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>

=== Regency and Victorian developments ===
The census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.

Also at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.

The fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.

In the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.

Dating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.

The Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of £1 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.

By 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.

[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794–1845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.

The flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].

Two further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.

West of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].

Hove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O’Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, p.37</ref>

The [[Hove Club]], a private members' club located at 28 Fourth Avenue, was founded in 1882.<ref name=\"The Hove Club: About Us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehoveclub.com/about-us-1/|title=The Hove Club - About Us|website=thehoveclub.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015200045/http://www.thehoveclub.com/about-us-1/|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"The Hove Club: Contact Us\">[http://www.thehoveclub.com/contact-us/ The Hove Club: Contact Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110142240/http://www.thehoveclub.com/contact-us/ |date=10 November 2013 }}</ref>

===First World War===
[[File:Hove War Memorial (04).JPG|thumb|[[Hove War Memorial]] on Grand Avenue]]
{{main|Hove War Memorial}}
Over 600 men from Hove were killed in the First World War. After the armistice, the town established a war memorial committee to decide on commemoration of the dead. The committee commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], the architect responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on London's Whitehall which became the focus of [[national memory|national remembrance]] services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1187556 |desc=Hove War Memorial|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Tim|last2=Gliddon|first2=Gerald|title=Lutyens and the Great War|year=2008|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=9780711228788|pages=75, 169}}</ref>

==Governance and politics==

===Coat of arms===
While it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own [[coat of arms]].  The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon's]] official heraldic description is \"Tierced in [[Pall (heraldry)|pairle]]: 1. [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] a [[Saltire#Heraldry|saltire]] [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] voided [[argent]]; 2. [[Gules]] two pairs of leg-irons interlaced argent; 3. [[Check (pattern)|Checky]] or and azure three [[martlet]]s or, all in a [[Bordure|border]] [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with six martlets or\".  The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove's history.  The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest.  The [[saltire]] of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the leg-shackles of [[Leonard of Noblac]] refer to the ancient [[parish church]]es of Hove and [[Aldrington]], [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's]] and [[St Leonard's Church, Aldrington|St Leonard's]] respectively.  [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey]] held land in the [[Rape of Lewes]] at the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] including the territory covered by Hove; his colours were blue and gold, represented by the chequerboard pattern in the background of the shield.<ref name=\"Willy32\">{{Harvnb|Willy|1978|p=32.}}</ref>

== Commercial ==
The town centre received substantial renovation in the late 1990s when the popular George Street was pedestrianised. Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>

== Transport ==
{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}

Hove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.

Hove has three railway stations. [[Hove railway station]] has direct access to the [[Brighton main line]] to London via a loop eliminating the need to go through [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.

Branching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.

== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==
[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]

== Education ==
Hove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School. There are four [[secondary school]]s serving the area: [[Blatchington Mill School and Sixth Form College|Blatchington Mill School]], [[Cardinal Newman Catholic School, Hove|Cardinal Newman Catholic School]], [[Hove Park School]] and [[King's School, Hove|King's School]].

[[Brighton Hove & Sussex Sixth Form College|Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College]] (BHASVIC), formerly Brighton, Hove & Sussex Grammar School, is a dedicated place of [[further education]], along with the Connaught Centre, Hove Park Sixth Form Centre and Blatchington Mill Sixth Form College.

Brighton is also home to private colleges such as [http://www.hovecollege.co.uk/ Hove College]  Founded in 1977, Hove College is a non-profit private higher education institution and offers accredited courses by [http://www.ocnlondon.org.uk/ OCN London] Hove College neighbors with [[British Study Centres School of English|British Study Centres]] and kindergarten schools. Hove College is 5 to 10 mins of walking distance from [[Palmeira Square|Palmeria Square.]]

Hove is also the location of a number of [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]] including [[Deepdene School]], Lancing College Preparatory School (formerly Mowden School) The Montessori Place, [[The Drive Prep School]] and St Christopher's School (now part of Brighton College). Hove is also home for several schools for foreign students of the English language.

== Sport and leisure ==
The home of [[Sussex County Cricket Club]] is at [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]]. It is used for county, national and international matches, music concerts, fireworks displays, and has found resurgent popularity with the introduction of [[Twenty20]].

Until 1997 Hove was home to the [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.]]'s [[Goldstone Ground]]. In September 2007, planning permission was confirmed for the club's new ground, at [[Falmer]], still within the city limits but on the Brighton side. The new stadium started development in late 2008, with the first game being played in August 2011.

[[Brighton & Hove Hockey Club]] is a [[field hockey]] club and its home ground is based in Hove.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightonandhovehockeyclub.net/how_to_find_us/ |title=How To Find Us |accessdate=2013-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214221927/http://www.brightonandhovehockeyclub.net/how_to_find_us/ |archivedate=14 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

'''Hove''' {{IPAc-en|h|oʊ|v}} is a [[seaside resort]] in the county of [[East Sussex]], and a constituent part of the [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] of [[Brighton and Hove]]. Originally a \"small but ancient fishing village\" surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton, and by the [[Victorian era]] it was a fully developed town with borough status.  Neighbouring parishes such as [[Aldrington]] and [[Hangleton]] were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1997, as part of [[1990s United Kingdom local government reform|local government reform]], the borough merged with [[Brighton]] to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove, and this unitary authority was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.

==Name and etymology==
Old spellings of Hove include Hou ([[Domesday Book]], 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675).<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp265-268|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7, the Rape of Lewes.

Suggestions included an [[Old Norse]] word meaning \"hall\", \"sanctuary\" or \"[[Tumulus|barrow]]\", in reference to the [[Bronze Age]] barrow near the present [[Palmeira Square]]; an [[Old English]] phrase ''aet thaem hofe'' meaning \"at the hall\";{{#tag:ref|This suggestion was given in ''[https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofsuss00robeiala/placenamesofsuss00robeiala_djvu.txt The Place-Names of Sussex]'' (1914) by R.G. Roberts.|group=note}} the Old English ''hufe'' meaning \"shelter\" or \"covering\"; and the [[Middle English]] ''hofe'' meaning \"anchorage\".  No other places in Britain are called Hove, and single-syllable names as a whole are rare in Sussex.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  The modern name was originally pronounced \"Hoove\" ({{IPAc-en|'|h|uː|v}}).  The present pronunciation ({{IPAc-en|'|h|oʊ|v}}) \"is comparatively recent\".<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p69\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 69.}}</ref>

==Geography and topography==
[[File:Hove Lawns - geograph.org.uk - 1326650.jpg|thumb|Hove Lawns is a large sea front garden situated to the west of the main Hove Esplanade]]
Northern parts of Hove are built on [[chalk]] beds, part of the [[Chalk Group#White Chalk Subgroup|White Chalk Subgroup]] found across southeast England.  There are also extensive areas of clay and sandy soil: areas of [[Woolwich Formation]] and [[Reading Formation]] clay, pockets of clay embedded with [[flint]], and a large deposit of [[brickearth]] in the Aldrington area.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  Hove's beaches are entirely [[Shingle beach|shingle]] and have the characteristics of a [[storm beach]].<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 90.}}</ref>  The [[Metres above sea level|mean height above sea level]] of land in the old parish of Hove varied between {{convert|22|ft|m}} to {{convert|190|ft|m}}.  After Hove became a borough and expanded to incorporate land from neighbouring parishes, the highest point was approximately {{convert|590|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\"/>  There are no rivers in Hove, but Westbourne Gardens at the western boundary of the old parish is named after the \"West [[Bourne (stream)|Bourne]]\", which was still visible in the 19th century but which now runs underground, and a map of 1588 shows another stream called East Brook.<ref name=\"ASON1\">{{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=1.}}</ref>

Until the 19th century the {{convert|778|acre|ha|adj=on}} parish was mostly agricultural.  Three farms—Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn—dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] described it as \"uncommonly rich\".  Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1–2\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1–2.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Middleton10–11\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=10–11.}}</ref>  The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as ''Hove Drove'' and led on to the Downs.  A long west–east route which crossed [[West Blatchington]], Hove and Preston parishes on its way to [[Lewes]] now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove.  The section called The Droveway, on which the [[British Engineerium|Goldstone Waterworks]] was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when [[Hove Park]] was built.

A large [[Sarsen]] stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of [[Hove Park]].  Links with druids were claimed; and some 19th-century sources stated it was part of a ring of stones similar to [[Stonehenge]], and that the others were buried in a pond at Goldstone Bottom, one of the [[Combe|coombes]] (small dry valleys) between the Downs and the sea.<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\"/><ref name=\"Middleton28\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=28.}}</ref>  The Goldstone was dug up and buried by a farmer, but was unearthed and re-erected in a new position in the park{{#tag:ref|At {{coord|50.839433|-0.173735}}|group=note}} in 1906.<ref name=\"Middleton29\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=29.}}</ref>

Hove has little ancient woodland. Only two small areas survive: one in [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]], and The Three Cornered Copse in the Tongdean area.  The latter covers {{convert|11|acre|ha}} and belonged to the [[Marquess of Abergavenny]] until Hove Borough Council bought it in January 1935. Trees in the copse include ash, beech, elm and sycamore, although more than 120 mature beech trees were blown down in the Great Storm of 1987.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv14p23\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 14, p. 23.}}</ref>

== History and development ==

During building work near [[Palmeira Square]] in 1856–57, workmen levelled a substantial burial mound.<ref name=\"Middleton51\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=51.}}</ref> A prominent feature of the landscape since 1200 BC,{{#tag:ref|[[Radiocarbon dating]] dated the coffin inside the burial mound to 1239 BC.<ref name=\"Middleton49\"/>|group=note}} the {{convert|20|ft|m}}-high tumulus<ref name=\"Middleton49\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=49.}}</ref> yielded, among other treasures, the [[Hove amber cup]]. Made of translucent red Baltic amber and approximately the same size as a regular china tea cup, the artefact can be seen in the [[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]].  Only one other has been found in Britain.  Also buried in the coffin in which the amber cup was found were a stone battle-axe, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] and a bronze dagger whose appearance is characteristic of the [[Wessex culture]].<ref name=\"Middleton51\"/>

=== Domesday Book ===
There are entries for Brighton and Portslade (Bristelmestune and Porteslage) and small downland settlements like Hangleton (Hangetone), but nothing for the location of Hove itself.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
The first known settlement in Hove was around the 12th century when [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was established. Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north–south some 250&nbsp;m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.
[[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] is a well-preserved 16th-century [[flint]] manor building. It is believed to have been built c. 1540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice [[High Sheriff of Sussex]], whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.

===18th century===
In 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.

In 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>

=== Regency and Victorian developments ===
The census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.

Also at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.

The fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.

In the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.

Dating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.

The Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of £1 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.

By 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.

[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794–1845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.

The flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].

Two further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.

West of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].

Hove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O’Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, p.37</ref>

The [[Hove Club]], a private members' club located at 28 Fourth Avenue, was founded in 1882.<ref name=\"The Hove Club: About Us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehoveclub.com/about-us-1/|title=The Hove Club - About Us|website=thehoveclub.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015200045/http://www.thehoveclub.com/about-us-1/|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"The Hove Club: Contact Us\">[http://www.thehoveclub.com/contact-us/ The Hove Club: Contact Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110142240/http://www.thehoveclub.com/contact-us/ |date=10 November 2013 }}</ref>

===First World War===
[[File:Hove War Memorial (04).JPG|thumb|[[Hove War Memorial]] on Grand Avenue]]
{{main|Hove War Memorial}}
Over 600 men from Hove were killed in the First World War. After the armistice, the town established a war memorial committee to decide on commemoration of the dead. The committee commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], the architect responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on London's Whitehall which became the focus of [[national memory|national remembrance]] services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1187556 |desc=Hove War Memorial|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Tim|last2=Gliddon|first2=Gerald|title=Lutyens and the Great War|year=2008|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=9780711228788|pages=75, 169}}</ref>

==Governance and politics==

===Coat of arms===
While it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own [[coat of arms]].  The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon's]] official heraldic description is \"Tierced in [[Pall (heraldry)|pairle]]: 1. [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] a [[Saltire#Heraldry|saltire]] [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] voided [[argent]]; 2. [[Gules]] two pairs of leg-irons interlaced argent; 3. [[Check (pattern)|Checky]] or and azure three [[martlet]]s or, all in a [[Bordure|border]] [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with six martlets or\".  The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove's history.  The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest.  The [[saltire]] of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the leg-shackles of [[Leonard of Noblac]] refer to the ancient [[parish church]]es of Hove and [[Aldrington]], [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's]] and [[St Leonard's Church, Aldrington|St Leonard's]] respectively.  [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey]] held land in the [[Rape of Lewes]] at the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] including the territory covered by Hove; his colours were blue and gold, represented by the chequerboard pattern in the background of the shield.<ref name=\"Willy32\">{{Harvnb|Willy|1978|p=32.}}</ref>

== Commercial ==
The town centre received substantial renovation in the late 1990s when the popular George Street was pedestrianised. Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>

== Transport ==
{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}

Hove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.

Hove has three railway stations. [[Hove railway station]] has direct access to the [[Brighton main line]] to London via a loop eliminating the need to go through [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.

Branching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.

== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==
[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]

== Education ==
Hove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School. There are four [[secondary school]]s serving the area: [[Blatchington Mill School and Sixth Form College|Blatchington Mill School]], [[Cardinal Newman Catholic School, Hove|Cardinal Newman Catholic School]], [[Hove Park School]] and [[King's School, Hove|King's School]].

[[Brighton Hove & Sussex Sixth Form College|Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College]] (BHASVIC), formerly Brighton, Hove & Sussex Grammar School, is a dedicated place of [[further education]], along with the Connaught Centre, Hove Park Sixth Form Centre and Blatchington Mill Sixth Form College.

Brighton is also home to private colleges such as [http://www.hovecollege.co.uk/ Hove College]  Founded in 1977, Hove College is a non-profit private higher education institution and offers accredited courses by [http://www.ocnlondon.org.uk/ OCN London] Hove College neighbors with [[British Study Centres School of English|British Study Centres]] and kindergarten schools. Hove College is 5 to 10 mins of walking distance from [[Palmeira Square|Palmeria Square.]]

Hove is also the location of a number of [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]] including [[Deepdene School]], Lancing College Preparatory School (formerly Mowden School) The Montessori Place, [[The Drive Prep School]] and St Christopher's School (now part of Brighton College). Hove is also home for several schools for foreign students of the English language.

== Sport and leisure ==
The home of [[Sussex County Cricket Club]] is at [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]]. It is used for county, national and international matches, music concerts, fireworks displays, and has found resurgent popularity with the introduction of [[Twenty20]].

Until 1997 Hove was home to the [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.]]'s [[Goldstone Ground]]. In September 2007, planning permission was confirmed for the club's new ground, at [[Falmer]], still within the city limits but on the Brighton side. The new stadium started development in late 2008, with the first game being played in August 2011.

[[Brighton & Hove Hockey Club]] is a [[field hockey]] club and its home ground is based in Hove.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightonandhovehockeyclub.net/how_to_find_us/ |title=How To Find Us |accessdate=2013-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214221927/http://www.brightonandhovehockeyclub.net/how_to_find_us/ |archivedate=14 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

'''Hove''' {{IPAc-en|h|oʊ|v}} is a [[seaside resort]] in the county of [[East Sussex]], and a constituent part of the [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] of [[Brighton and Hove]]. Originally a \"small but ancient fishing village\" surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton, and by the [[Victorian era]] it was a fully developed town with borough status.  Neighbouring parishes such as [[Aldrington]] and [[Hangleton]] were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1997, as part of [[1990s United Kingdom local government reform|local government reform]], the borough merged with [[Brighton]] to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove, and this unitary authority was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.

==Name and etymology==
Old spellings of Hove include Hou ([[Domesday Book]], 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675).<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp265-268|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7, the Rape of Lewes.

Suggestions included an [[Old Norse]] word meaning \"hall\", \"sanctuary\" or \"[[Tumulus|barrow]]\", in reference to the [[Bronze Age]] barrow near the present [[Palmeira Square]]; an [[Old English]] phrase ''aet thaem hofe'' meaning \"at the hall\";{{#tag:ref|This suggestion was given in ''[https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofsuss00robeiala/placenamesofsuss00robeiala_djvu.txt The Place-Names of Sussex]'' (1914) by R.G. Roberts.|group=note}} the Old English ''hufe'' meaning \"shelter\" or \"covering\"; and the [[Middle English]] ''hofe'' meaning \"anchorage\".  No other places in Britain are called Hove, and single-syllable names as a whole are rare in Sussex.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  The modern name was originally pronounced \"Hoove\" ({{IPAc-en|'|h|uː|v}}).  The present pronunciation ({{IPAc-en|'|h|oʊ|v}}) \"is comparatively recent\".<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p69\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 69.}}</ref>

==Geography and topography==
[[File:Hove Lawns - geograph.org.uk - 1326650.jpg|thumb|Hove Lawns is a large sea front garden situated to the west of the main Hove Esplanade]]
Northern parts of Hove are built on [[chalk]] beds, part of the [[Chalk Group#White Chalk Subgroup|White Chalk Subgroup]] found across southeast England.  There are also extensive areas of clay and sandy soil: areas of [[Woolwich Formation]] and [[Reading Formation]] clay, pockets of clay embedded with [[flint]], and a large deposit of [[brickearth]] in the Aldrington area.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  Hove's beaches are entirely [[Shingle beach|shingle]] and have the characteristics of a [[storm beach]].<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 90.}}</ref>  The [[Metres above sea level|mean height above sea level]] of land in the old parish of Hove varied between {{convert|22|ft|m}} to {{convert|190|ft|m}}.  After Hove became a borough and expanded to incorporate land from neighbouring parishes, the highest point was approximately {{convert|590|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\"/>  There are no rivers in Hove, but Westbourne Gardens at the western boundary of the old parish is named after the \"West [[Bourne (stream)|Bourne]]\", which was still visible in the 19th century but which now runs underground, and a map of 1588 shows another stream called East Brook.<ref name=\"ASON1\">{{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=1.}}</ref>

Until the 19th century the {{convert|778|acre|ha|adj=on}} parish was mostly agricultural.  Three farms—Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn—dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] described it as \"uncommonly rich\".  Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1–2\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1–2.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Middleton10–11\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=10–11.}}</ref>  The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as ''Hove Drove'' and led on to the Downs.  A long west–east route which crossed [[West Blatchington]], Hove and Preston parishes on its way to [[Lewes]] now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove.  The section called The Droveway, on which the [[British Engineerium|Goldstone Waterworks]] was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when [[Hove Park]] was built.  A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer's Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv4p34–36\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 4, pp. 34–36.}}</ref>

A large [[Sarsen]] stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of [[Hove Park]].  Links with druids were claimed; and some 19th-century sources stated it was part of a ring of stones similar to [[Stonehenge]], and that the others were buried in a pond at Goldstone Bottom, one of the [[Combe|coombes]] (small dry valleys) between the Downs and the sea.<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\"/><ref name=\"Middleton28\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=28.}}</ref>  The Goldstone was dug up and buried by a farmer, but was unearthed and re-erected in a new position in the park{{#tag:ref|At {{coord|50.839433|-0.173735}}|group=note}} in 1906.<ref name=\"Middleton29\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=29.}}</ref>

Hove has little ancient woodland. Only two small areas survive: one in [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]], and The Three Cornered Copse in the Tongdean area.  The latter covers {{convert|11|acre|ha}} and belonged to the [[Marquess of Abergavenny]] until Hove Borough Council bought it in January 1935. Trees in the copse include ash, beech, elm and sycamore, although more than 120 mature beech trees were blown down in the Great Storm of 1987.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv14p23\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 14, p. 23.}}</ref>

== History and development ==

=== Pre-Roman evidence ===
Fossilised remains from the [[Pleistocene]] era have been found in three locations in Hove: an {{convert|11|lb|2|oz|kg|adj=on}} [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] from ''[[Straight-tusked elephant|Elephas antiquus]]'', excavated from the garden of a house in Poplar Avenue; teeth from a juvenile elephant deep in the soil at Ventnor Villas; and a prehistoric horse's tooth in the soil near Hove Street.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p78\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 7, p. 78.}}</ref>

During building work near [[Palmeira Square]] in 1856–57, workmen levelled a substantial burial mound.<ref name=\"Middleton51\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=51.}}</ref> A prominent feature of the landscape since 1200 BC,{{#tag:ref|[[Radiocarbon dating]] dated the coffin inside the burial mound to 1239 BC.<ref name=\"Middleton49\"/>|group=note}} the {{convert|20|ft|m}}-high tumulus<ref name=\"Middleton49\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=49.}}</ref> yielded, among other treasures, the [[Hove amber cup]]. Made of translucent red Baltic amber and approximately the same size as a regular china tea cup, the artefact can be seen in the [[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]].  Only one other has been found in Britain.  Also buried in the coffin in which the amber cup was found were a stone battle-axe, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] and a bronze dagger whose appearance is characteristic of the [[Wessex culture]].<ref name=\"Middleton51\"/>

=== Domesday Book ===
There are entries for Brighton and Portslade (Bristelmestune and Porteslage) and small downland settlements like Hangleton (Hangetone), but nothing for the location of Hove itself.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
The first known settlement in Hove was around the 12th century when [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was established. Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north–south some 250&nbsp;m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.
[[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] is a well-preserved 16th-century [[flint]] manor building. It is believed to have been built c. 1540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice [[High Sheriff of Sussex]], whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.

===18th century===
In 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.

In 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>

=== Regency and Victorian developments ===
The census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.

Also at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.

The fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.

In the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.

Dating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.

The Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of £1 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.

By 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.

[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794–1845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.

The flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].

Two further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.

West of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].

Hove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O’Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, p.37</ref>

The [[Hove Club]], a private members' club located at 28 Fourth Avenue, was founded in 1882.<ref name=\"The Hove Club: About Us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehoveclub.com/about-us-1/|title=The Hove Club - About Us|website=thehoveclub.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015200045/http://www.thehoveclub.com/about-us-1/|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"The Hove Club: Contact Us\">[http://www.thehoveclub.com/contact-us/ The Hove Club: Contact Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110142240/http://www.thehoveclub.com/contact-us/ |date=10 November 2013 }}</ref>

===First World War===
[[File:Hove War Memorial (04).JPG|thumb|[[Hove War Memorial]] on Grand Avenue]]
{{main|Hove War Memorial}}
Over 600 men from Hove were killed in the First World War. After the armistice, the town established a war memorial committee to decide on commemoration of the dead. The committee commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], the architect responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on London's Whitehall which became the focus of [[national memory|national remembrance]] services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1187556 |desc=Hove War Memorial|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Tim|last2=Gliddon|first2=Gerald|title=Lutyens and the Great War|year=2008|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=9780711228788|pages=75, 169}}</ref>

==Governance and politics==

===Coat of arms===
While it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own [[coat of arms]].  The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon's]] official heraldic description is \"Tierced in [[Pall (heraldry)|pairle]]: 1. [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] a [[Saltire#Heraldry|saltire]] [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] voided [[argent]]; 2. [[Gules]] two pairs of leg-irons interlaced argent; 3. [[Check (pattern)|Checky]] or and azure three [[martlet]]s or, all in a [[Bordure|border]] [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with six martlets or\".  The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove's history.  The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest.  The [[saltire]] of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the leg-shackles of [[Leonard of Noblac]] refer to the ancient [[parish church]]es of Hove and [[Aldrington]], [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's]] and [[St Leonard's Church, Aldrington|St Leonard's]] respectively.  [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey]] held land in the [[Rape of Lewes]] at the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] including the territory covered by Hove; his colours were blue and gold, represented by the chequerboard pattern in the background of the shield.<ref name=\"Willy32\">{{Harvnb|Willy|1978|p=32.}}</ref>

== Commercial ==
The town centre received substantial renovation in the late 1990s when the popular George Street was pedestrianised. Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>

== Transport ==
{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}

Hove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.

Hove has three railway stations. [[Hove railway station]] has direct access to the [[Brighton main line]] to London via a loop eliminating the need to go through [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.

Branching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.

== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==
[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]

== Education ==
Hove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School. There are four [[secondary school]]s serving the area: [[Blatchington Mill School and Sixth Form College|Blatchington Mill School]], [[Cardinal Newman Catholic School, Hove|Cardinal Newman Catholic School]], [[Hove Park School]] and [[King's School, Hove|King's School]].

[[Brighton Hove & Sussex Sixth Form College|Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College]] (BHASVIC), formerly Brighton, Hove & Sussex Grammar School, is a dedicated place of [[further education]], along with the Connaught Centre, Hove Park Sixth Form Centre and Blatchington Mill Sixth Form College.

Brighton is also home to private colleges such as [http://www.hovecollege.co.uk/ Hove College]  Founded in 1977, Hove College is a non-profit private higher education institution and offers accredited courses by [http://www.ocnlondon.org.uk/ OCN London] Hove College neighbors with [[British Study Centres School of English|British Study Centres]] and kindergarten schools. Hove College is 5 to 10 mins of walking distance from [[Palmeira Square|Palmeria Square.]]

Hove is also the location of a number of [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]] including [[Deepdene School]], Lancing College Preparatory School (formerly Mowden School) The Montessori Place, [[The Drive Prep School]] and St Christopher's School (now part of Brighton College). Hove is also home for several schools for foreign students of the English language.

'''Mequon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|k|w|ɒ|n}}) is a city in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], United States. Located on [[Interstate 43]], the community is a [[suburb]] in the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. It [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of Wisconsin#City|city]] in 1957 to avoid annexation by the City of [[Milwaukee]]. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 23,132.

==Toponymy==
\"Mequon\" may have come from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word \"Emikwaan\" or \"Miguan\", meaning ladle, referring to the shape of the river in the area.<ref>\"[http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm \"Yankee Settler's Cottage.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420074506/http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm |date=2006-04-20}} [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]] website</ref> Alternatively, the name may come from an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquin]] word meaning \"feather\", as suggested by the current [[Menominee]] name of the town: ''Mēkon''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Isham Day House Mequon WI May09.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Isham Day House]] is now a museum located in Settlers Park.]]

The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Sauk people]]. In the early 19th century, the   Potawatomi had a village in present-day [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road. In 1831, The Menominee surrendered the land between the [[Milwaukee River]] and [[Lake Michigan]] to the United States Federal Government through the [[Treaty of Washington, with Menominee (1831)|Treaty of Washington]].<ref name= \"corrigan\">Walter D. Corrigan, ''History of the Town of Mequon, Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, Brought Down to about 1870''. Mequon: Mequon Club, 1950.</ref> The Potawatomi surrendered the area of Mequon west of the Milwaukee River in 1833 through the [[Treaty of Chicago]], which required them to leave the area by 1838.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=article&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&id=WI.OzEarlyHist&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref> While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to [[Kansas]], some chose to remain, and were known as \"strolling Potawatomi\" because they were migrant [[Squatting|squatters]]. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the [[Forest County Potawatomi Community]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Potawatomi History|url=https://www.mpm.edu/content/wirp/ICW-152|publisher=Milwaukee Public Museum|accessdate=February 20, 2020}}</ref>

White trappers, explorers, and traders used the Milwaukee River through the middle of what is now Mequon as a means of transportation. The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

===Freistadt===
In October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County. [http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/777/Trinity-Evangelical-Lutheran-Church---Fr Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church - Freistadt]</ref> In German, \"Freistadt\" means \"Free City\".<ref>*[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=5544 Freistadt] in ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History''</ref>

In 1840, they built a log cabin church, which they named Trinity Lutheran Church. It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo]] was organized in Freistadt. However, the Freistadt church became a part of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&entity=WI.OzEarlyHist.p0103&id=WI.OzEarlyHist&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref> The wooden church was replaced with a limestone building in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|title=Property Record: 10729 W Freistadt Rd.|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Property/HI13485|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

===Thiensville===
Joachim Heinrich Thien moved to the area in 1842 from [[Oldenburg]], [[Prussia]], and helped design a plan for the settlement that would become [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]]. A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.

Thien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

Thiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.

In 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A. Nieman Canning Company in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD-kby0LiuEC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123|title=Stalag Wisconsin: Inside WW II Prisoner-of-war Camps|last=Cowley|first=Betty|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Badger Books Inc.|isbn=9781878569837|pages=120–25|language=en}}</ref> German prisoners from Camp Rockfield in [[Rockfield, Wisconsin]], (located in present-day [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Germantown]]) also worked at the Fromm Bros., Nieman & Co.

In the 20th century, Mequon and the village of Theinsville developed a close relationship,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ci.mequon.wi.us/econdev/page/city-mequon-and-village-thiensville-community-gateway-features|title=City of Mequon and Village of Thiensville Community Gateway Features {{!}} Mequon Wisconsin|website=www.ci.mequon.wi.us|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> with shared schools,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtsd.k12.wi.us/|title=Mequon-Thiensville School District {{!}} The Launchpad to Success|website=www.mtsd.k12.wi.us|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> animal clinics,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thiensvillemequonsac.com/|title=Homepage {{!}} Thiensville-Mequon Small Animal Clinic|website=www.thiensvillemequonsac.com|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> fire departments, libraries,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flwlib.org/|title=Frank L.

===City of Mequon===
The Town of Mequon experienced significant population growth during the [[suburbanization]] that followed World War II. Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

The city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier. Despite being a city, much of Mequon remains rural, and nearly half of the land in the community in undeveloped.

==Geography==
Mequon is located at {{coord|43|13|27|N|87|57|36|W|type:city}} (43.224243, &minus;87.960094), about {{convert|15|mi}} north of Milwaukee and is part of the [[Milwaukee–Racine–Waukesha Metropolitan Area|Milwaukee metropolitan area]].<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|48.77|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|46.28|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-24}}</ref> As of 2005, Mequon was the third-largest city in terms of land area in the state of [[Wisconsin]].<ref>[http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/Sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/%7B3468C14F-4B58-4594-9571-E14499B23DD9%7D.PDF Estimated Population per Square Mile of Land Area, Wisconsin Municipalities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005025257/http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/Sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/%7B3468C14F-4B58-4594-9571-E14499B23DD9%7D.PDF |date=2011-10-05 }}. The cities of [[Milwaukee]] (96.14 sq mi) and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] (75.40 sq mi) are larger. Green Bay (45.53 sq mi) is the next largest city. The village of [[Kronenwetter, Wisconsin|Kronenwetter]] is also larger, as are more than 200 [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Town|towns]].</ref> Though much of the population lives in residential areas, approximately half of the land within the city's boundaries is undeveloped or farmed.<ref name=Citywebsite>{{cite web|title=Home - City of Mequon website|url=http://www.ci.mequon.wi.us/|work=City of Mequon website|publisher=City of Mequon|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

The [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Village of Thiensville]] is an [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] in central Mequon. The city is also bordered by the [[Cedarburg (town), Wisconsin|Town of Cedarburg]], [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin|City of Cedarburg]], and [[Grafton (town), Wisconsin|Town of Grafton]] to the north; [[Lake Michigan]] to the east; the [[Bayside, Wisconsin|Village of Bayside]], [[River Hills, Wisconsin|Village of River Hills]], [[Brown Deer, Wisconsin|Village of Brown Deer]], and [[Milwaukee|City of Milwaukee]] to the south; and the [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Village of Germantown]] to the west.

[[File:MequonLakeMichigan.jpg|thumb|The clay bluffs in Virmond Park along Lake Michigan]]

The city is located on the western shore of [[Lake Michigan]], and the coastline is characterized by clay [[Cliff|bluffs]] ranging from 80 feet (24 meters) to 140 feet (43 meters) in height with deep [[ravine]]s where streams flow into the lake. Clay bluffs are a geological formation characteristic of the Lake Michigan shoreline, and are found in few other areas of the world. Much of the coast has mixed gravel and sand beaches.<ref name=\"Resources\">{{cite web|title=Inventory of Agricultural, Natural, and Cultural Resources|url=https://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/DocumentCenter/View/813/Comprehensive-Plan-2035-Chapter-3?bidId=|publisher=Ozaukee County|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Coastal\">{{cite web|title=Central Lake Michigan Coastal Ecological Landscape|url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Landscapes/documents/1805Ch8.pdf#view=Fit|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>

The city is located in the [[Southeastern Wisconsin Till Plains (ecoregion)|Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains]] that were created by the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] during the most recent ice age. The soil is clayey glacial [[till]] with a thin layer of [[loess]] on the surface. The town has some [[limestone]] deposits, including the [[Devonian]] Thiensville formation in north-central Mequon and the [[Silurian]] Little Menomonee River Reef District, which contains [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] marine fossils. The [[Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources]] considers the eastern part of the city along the lake to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape, while the western part of the city is in the Southern Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape.<ref name=\"Resources\"/>

The [[Milwaukee River]] and its [[tributary]] Pigeon Creek flow through the eastern part of the city. Little Menomonee Creek and the Little Menomonee River, which are tributaries of the [[Menomonee River]], flow through western Mequon.<ref name=\"GR3\"/>

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Mequon was an upland forest dominated by [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]] and [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]] trees. There is also a large [[Larix laricina|tamarack]] swamp along the Little Menomonee River. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture.<ref name=Resources />

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Grafton. Large mammals, including [[white-tailed deer]], [[coyotes]], and [[red fox]]es can be seen in the city. Many birds, including [[great blue heron]]s and [[wild turkey]]s are found in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ecological Landscapes of Wisconsin |url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Landscapes/documents/1805Ch18.pdf#view=Fit |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=February 13, 2020}}</ref> The city is also home to many rare and notable species, including the state-designated endangered [[Pterospora|pinedrops]] and [[Plantago cordata|heartleaf plantain]]; threatened [[Eurybia furcata|forked aster]], [[Trillium nivale|snow trillium]], and [[Gentiana alba|yellow gentian]]; as well as [[Lithospermum latifolium|American gromwell]] and [[Jeffersonia|twinleaf]], which are state-designated special concern plant species.<ref name=Resources />

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the [[emerald ash borer]], [[common carp]], [[Phalaris arundinacea|reed canary grass]], the [[Phragmites|common reed]], [[Lythrum salicaria|purple loosestrife]], [[Alliaria petiolata|garlic mustard]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|Eurasian buckthorns]], and [[honeysuckle]]s.<ref name=\"Coastal\"/>

===Climate===
Mequon experiences four distinct [[season]]s, with variation in precipitation and temperature being very wide. The overall climate of the city is moderated by nearby [[Lake Michigan]], which causes temperatures to be cooler in summer and especially spring, and which keeps overnight temperatures warmer in winter. In March and April, the temperature in Mequon can be 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 8 degrees Celsius) cooler than temperatures in towns just 15 miles (25 kilometers) farther from the lake.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} In December and January, the effect is reversed, with temperatures in inland towns falling much lower.

In Mequon, the warmest month of the year is July, when the high temperature averages 81&nbsp;°F (27&nbsp;°C), with low temperatures of approximately 59&nbsp;°F (15&nbsp;°C). June and July are the wettest months of the year, with the majority of [[rain]] falling in short-lived [[thunderstorm]]s. January is the coldest month in Mequon, with average high temperatures averaging only 27&nbsp;°F (-3&nbsp;°C), and lows averaging 11&nbsp;°F (-12&nbsp;°C).<ref name=TWC>{{cite web|title=Average Weather for Mequon, WI - Temperature and Precipitation|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USWI0443|work=weather.com|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> February is the driest month, with almost all precipitation falling in the form of [[snow]]. In an average winter, 47.0 in (1.3m) of snow falls. The city's proximity to Lake Michigan often [[lake-effect snow|increases]] the snow received by the city. Most of the city's snowfall comes from systems such as [[Alberta clipper]]s and [[Panhandle hook]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The highest temperature ever recorded in Mequon was 105&nbsp;°F (41&nbsp;°C) on July 24, 1935, and again on July 17, 1995. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was -40&nbsp;°F (-40&nbsp;°C), on January 17, 1982, also known as [[Cold Sunday]].<ref name=TWC/>

==Economy==
[[File:O'Brien-Peuschel Farmstead Mequon WI May-09.jpg|thumb|Located in rural northwest Mequon, the [[O'Brien-Peuschel Farmstead]] was settled in 1846 and has extant buildings dating to as early as 1850. It is [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|listed]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]

[[File:Frank Vocke Octagonal Barn.jpg|thumb|Farmers in eastern Mequon built [[Round barn#Octagonal|octagonal barns]], believing the shape to be better suited to the winds coming off nearby Lake Michigan.

Mequon's economy was primarily agricultural. Some farmsteads from as early as the 1840s and 1850s still stand in the community and are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The first major businesses were hydropowered mills on the Milwaukee River and other businesses that served local farmers, many of which concentrated in Thiensville.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schnell|first1=Traci E.|last2=Faltinson|first2=Brian J.|title=Main Street Historic District|url={{NRHP url|id=04001279}}|accessdate=2017-02-03|work=[[NRHP]] Inventory-Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|date=May 2003}}</ref>

Beginning in the 1920s, the Nieman and Fromm families began [[fur farming]] [[Silver fox (animal)|silver foxes]] in Mequon. Several companies, including Fromm Bros., Nieman & Co.; Federal Silver Fox Farms, Inc.; Ozaukee Fur Farms Co.; Herbert A. Nieman & Co.; and Cedarburg Fox Farms, Inc. all began operating in Mequon and southern Cedarburg in the 1920s. In 1928, 6600 of the 8841 pelts sold by the New York Auction Co. came from the Fromm and Nieman operations in Wisconsin for a record-breaking sum of $1,021,000. In 1929, the Nieman and Fromm operations broke their own record with auction sales of $1,331,679, making them a leader in the national fur industry. By 1937, the farms were selling 30,000 pelts per year. After World War II, changing consumer tastes caused the farms to begin breeding [[mink]] in addition to silver fox. Fur sales declined later in the 20th century, and farms sold their last pelts in 1985.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Heggland|first1=Timothy F.|title=Nieman, Edwin J. Sr., House|url={{NRHP url|id=96000418}}|accessdate=2017-02-11|work=[[NRHP]] Inventory-Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|date=1995-01-05}}</ref>

The mid-to-late 20th century saw diversification in Mequon's economy. Retail stores opened to serve the increasingly suburban community, and manufacturers opened plants. In 1983, [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] moved from its campus in Milwaukee to a newly acquired campus in Mequon. In 1994, St. Mary's Hospital Ozaukee opened. As of 2015, the two institutions—both located in close proximity to [[Interstate 43]]—were among the largest employers in Ozaukee County. Despite the growth of new industries, half of Mequon's land remains undeveloped and agriculture continues to play a significant role in the local economy.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>

'''Mequon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|k|w|ɒ|n}}) is a city in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], United States. Located on [[Interstate 43]], the community is a [[suburb]] in the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. It [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of Wisconsin#City|city]] in 1957 to avoid annexation by the City of [[Milwaukee]]. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 23,132.

==Toponymy==
\"Mequon\" may have come from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word \"Emikwaan\" or \"Miguan\", meaning ladle, referring to the shape of the river in the area.<ref>\"[http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm \"Yankee Settler's Cottage.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420074506/http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm |date=2006-04-20}} [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]] website</ref> Alternatively, the name may come from an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquin]] word meaning \"feather\", as suggested by the current [[Menominee]] name of the town: ''Mēkon''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Isham Day House Mequon WI May09.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Isham Day House]] is now a museum located in Settlers Park.]]

The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Sauk people]]. In the early 19th century, the   Potawatomi had a village in present-day [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road. In 1831, The Menominee surrendered the land between the [[Milwaukee River]] and [[Lake Michigan]] to the United States Federal Government through the [[Treaty of Washington, with Menominee (1831)|Treaty of Washington]].<ref name= \"corrigan\">Walter D. Corrigan, ''History of the Town of Mequon, Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, Brought Down to about 1870''. Mequon: Mequon Club, 1950.</ref> The Potawatomi surrendered the area of Mequon west of the Milwaukee River in 1833 through the [[Treaty of Chicago]], which required them to leave the area by 1838.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=article&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&id=WI.OzEarlyHist&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref> While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to [[Kansas]], some chose to remain, and were known as \"strolling Potawatomi\" because they were migrant [[Squatting|squatters]]. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the [[Forest County Potawatomi Community]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Potawatomi History|url=https://www.mpm.edu/content/wirp/ICW-152|publisher=Milwaukee Public Museum|accessdate=February 20, 2020}}</ref>

White trappers, explorers, and traders used the Milwaukee River through the middle of what is now Mequon as a means of transportation. The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

===Freistadt===
In October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County. [http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/777/Trinity-Evangelical-Lutheran-Church---Fr Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church - Freistadt]</ref> In German, \"Freistadt\" means \"Free City\".<ref>*[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=5544 Freistadt] in ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History''</ref>

In 1840, they built a log cabin church, which they named Trinity Lutheran Church. It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo]] was organized in Freistadt. However, the Freistadt church became a part of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&entity=WI.OzEarlyHist.p0103&id=WI.OzEarlyHist&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref> The wooden church was replaced with a limestone building in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|title=Property Record: 10729 W Freistadt Rd.|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Property/HI13485|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

===Thiensville===
Joachim Heinrich Thien moved to the area in 1842 from [[Oldenburg]], [[Prussia]], and helped design a plan for the settlement that would become [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]]. A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.

Thien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

Thiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.

In 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A. Nieman Canning Company in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD-kby0LiuEC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123|title=Stalag Wisconsin: Inside WW II Prisoner-of-war Camps|last=Cowley|first=Betty|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Badger Books Inc.|isbn=9781878569837|pages=120–25|language=en}}</ref> German prisoners from Camp Rockfield in [[Rockfield, Wisconsin]], (located in present-day [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Germantown]]) also worked at the Fromm Bros., Nieman & Co.

In the 20th century, Mequon and the village of Theinsville developed a close relationship,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ci.mequon.wi.us/econdev/page/city-mequon-and-village-thiensville-community-gateway-features|title=City of Mequon and Village of Thiensville Community Gateway Features {{!}} Mequon Wisconsin|website=www.ci.mequon.wi.us|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> with shared schools,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtsd.k12.wi.us/|title=Mequon-Thiensville School District {{!}} The Launchpad to Success|website=www.mtsd.k12.wi.us|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> animal clinics,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thiensvillemequonsac.com/|title=Homepage {{!}} Thiensville-Mequon Small Animal Clinic|website=www.thiensvillemequonsac.com|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> fire departments, libraries,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flwlib.org/|title=Frank L.

===City of Mequon===
The Town of Mequon experienced significant population growth during the [[suburbanization]] that followed World War II. Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>

The city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier. Despite being a city, much of Mequon remains rural, and nearly half of the land in the community in undeveloped.

==Geography==
Mequon is located at {{coord|43|13|27|N|87|57|36|W|type:city}} (43.224243, &minus;87.960094), about {{convert|15|mi}} north of Milwaukee and is part of the [[Milwaukee–Racine–Waukesha Metropolitan Area|Milwaukee metropolitan area]].<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|48.77|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|46.28|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-24}}</ref> As of 2005, Mequon was the third-largest city in terms of land area in the state of [[Wisconsin]].<ref>[http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/Sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/%7B3468C14F-4B58-4594-9571-E14499B23DD9%7D.PDF Estimated Population per Square Mile of Land Area, Wisconsin Municipalities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005025257/http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/Sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/%7B3468C14F-4B58-4594-9571-E14499B23DD9%7D.PDF |date=2011-10-05 }}. The cities of [[Milwaukee]] (96.14 sq mi) and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] (75.40 sq mi) are larger. Green Bay (45.53 sq mi) is the next largest city. The village of [[Kronenwetter, Wisconsin|Kronenwetter]] is also larger, as are more than 200 [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Town|towns]].</ref> Though much of the population lives in residential areas, approximately half of the land within the city's boundaries is undeveloped or farmed.<ref name=Citywebsite>{{cite web|title=Home - City of Mequon website|url=http://www.ci.mequon.wi.us/|work=City of Mequon website|publisher=City of Mequon|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

The [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Village of Thiensville]] is an [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] in central Mequon. The city is also bordered by the [[Cedarburg (town), Wisconsin|Town of Cedarburg]], [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin|City of Cedarburg]], and [[Grafton (town), Wisconsin|Town of Grafton]] to the north; [[Lake Michigan]] to the east; the [[Bayside, Wisconsin|Village of Bayside]], [[River Hills, Wisconsin|Village of River Hills]], [[Brown Deer, Wisconsin|Village of Brown Deer]], and [[Milwaukee|City of Milwaukee]] to the south; and the [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Village of Germantown]] to the west.

[[File:MequonLakeMichigan.jpg|thumb|The clay bluffs in Virmond Park along Lake Michigan]]

The city is located on the western shore of [[Lake Michigan]], and the coastline is characterized by clay [[Cliff|bluffs]] ranging from 80 feet (24 meters) to 140 feet (43 meters) in height with deep [[ravine]]s where streams flow into the lake. Clay bluffs are a geological formation characteristic of the Lake Michigan shoreline, and are found in few other areas of the world. Much of the coast has mixed gravel and sand beaches.<ref name=\"Resources\">{{cite web|title=Inventory of Agricultural, Natural, and Cultural Resources|url=https://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/DocumentCenter/View/813/Comprehensive-Plan-2035-Chapter-3?bidId=|publisher=Ozaukee County|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Coastal\">{{cite web|title=Central Lake Michigan Coastal Ecological Landscape|url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Landscapes/documents/1805Ch8.pdf#view=Fit|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>

The city is located in the [[Southeastern Wisconsin Till Plains (ecoregion)|Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains]] that were created by the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] during the most recent ice age. The soil is clayey glacial [[till]] with a thin layer of [[loess]] on the surface. The town has some [[limestone]] deposits, including the [[Devonian]] Thiensville formation in north-central Mequon and the [[Silurian]] Little Menomonee River Reef District, which contains [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] marine fossils. The [[Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources]] considers the eastern part of the city along the lake to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape, while the western part of the city is in the Southern Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape.<ref name=\"Resources\"/>

The [[Milwaukee River]] and its [[tributary]] Pigeon Creek flow through the eastern part of the city. Little Menomonee Creek and the Little Menomonee River, which are tributaries of the [[Menomonee River]], flow through western Mequon.<ref name=\"GR3\"/>

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Mequon was an upland forest dominated by [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]] and [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]] trees. There is also a large [[Larix laricina|tamarack]] swamp along the Little Menomonee River. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture.<ref name=Resources />

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Grafton. Large mammals, including [[white-tailed deer]], [[coyotes]], and [[red fox]]es can be seen in the city. Many birds, including [[great blue heron]]s and [[wild turkey]]s are found in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ecological Landscapes of Wisconsin |url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Landscapes/documents/1805Ch18.pdf#view=Fit |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=February 13, 2020}}</ref> The city is also home to many rare and notable species, including the state-designated endangered [[Pterospora|pinedrops]] and [[Plantago cordata|heartleaf plantain]]; threatened [[Eurybia furcata|forked aster]], [[Trillium nivale|snow trillium]], and [[Gentiana alba|yellow gentian]]; as well as [[Lithospermum latifolium|American gromwell]] and [[Jeffersonia|twinleaf]], which are state-designated special concern plant species.<ref name=Resources />

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the [[emerald ash borer]], [[common carp]], [[Phalaris arundinacea|reed canary grass]], the [[Phragmites|common reed]], [[Lythrum salicaria|purple loosestrife]], [[Alliaria petiolata|garlic mustard]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|Eurasian buckthorns]], and [[honeysuckle]]s.<ref name=\"Coastal\"/>

===Climate===
Mequon experiences four distinct [[season]]s, with variation in precipitation and temperature being very wide. The overall climate of the city is moderated by nearby [[Lake Michigan]], which causes temperatures to be cooler in summer and especially spring, and which keeps overnight temperatures warmer in winter. In March and April, the temperature in Mequon can be 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 8 degrees Celsius) cooler than temperatures in towns just 15 miles (25 kilometers) farther from the lake.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} In December and January, the effect is reversed, with temperatures in inland towns falling much lower.

In Mequon, the warmest month of the year is July, when the high temperature averages 81&nbsp;°F (27&nbsp;°C), with low temperatures of approximately 59&nbsp;°F (15&nbsp;°C). June and July are the wettest months of the year, with the majority of [[rain]] falling in short-lived [[thunderstorm]]s. January is the coldest month in Mequon, with average high temperatures averaging only 27&nbsp;°F (-3&nbsp;°C), and lows averaging 11&nbsp;°F (-12&nbsp;°C).<ref name=TWC>{{cite web|title=Average Weather for Mequon, WI - Temperature and Precipitation|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USWI0443|work=weather.com|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> February is the driest month, with almost all precipitation falling in the form of [[snow]]. In an average winter, 47.0 in (1.3m) of snow falls. The city's proximity to Lake Michigan often [[lake-effect snow|increases]] the snow received by the city. Most of the city's snowfall comes from systems such as [[Alberta clipper]]s and [[Panhandle hook]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The highest temperature ever recorded in Mequon was 105&nbsp;°F (41&nbsp;°C) on July 24, 1935, and again on July 17, 1995. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was -40&nbsp;°F (-40&nbsp;°C), on January 17, 1982, also known as [[Cold Sunday]].<ref name=TWC/>

==Economy==
[[File:O'Brien-Peuschel Farmstead Mequon WI May-09.jpg|thumb|Located in rural northwest Mequon, the [[O'Brien-Peuschel Farmstead]] was settled in 1846 and has extant buildings dating to as early as 1850. It is [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|listed]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]

[[File:Frank Vocke Octagonal Barn.jpg|thumb|Farmers in eastern Mequon built [[Round barn#Octagonal|octagonal barns]], believing the shape to be better suited to the winds coming off nearby Lake Michigan. The 1891 Frank Vocke barn is a surviving example of these once-common barns.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nina Jo|last=Look|title=The Clausing Octagon Barns of Ozaukee County: An In-Depth Study|url=https://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/DocumentCenter/View/471/In-Depth-Study-of-Octagon-Barns?bidId= |publisher=Ozaukee County|accessdate=April 12, 2020}}</ref>]]

Mequon's economy was primarily agricultural. Some farmsteads from as early as the 1840s and 1850s still stand in the community and are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The first major businesses were hydropowered mills on the Milwaukee River and other businesses that served local farmers, many of which concentrated in Thiensville.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schnell|first1=Traci E.|last2=Faltinson|first2=Brian J.|title=Main Street Historic District|url={{NRHP url|id=04001279}}|accessdate=2017-02-03|work=[[NRHP]] Inventory-Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|date=May 2003}}</ref>

Beginning in the 1920s, the Nieman and Fromm families began [[fur farming]] [[Silver fox (animal)|silver foxes]] in Mequon. Several companies, including Fromm Bros., Nieman & Co.; Federal Silver Fox Farms, Inc.; Ozaukee Fur Farms Co.; Herbert A. Nieman & Co.; and Cedarburg Fox Farms, Inc. all began operating in Mequon and southern Cedarburg in the 1920s. In 1928, 6600 of the 8841 pelts sold by the New York Auction Co. came from the Fromm and Nieman operations in Wisconsin for a record-breaking sum of $1,021,000. In 1929, the Nieman and Fromm operations broke their own record with auction sales of $1,331,679, making them a leader in the national fur industry. By 1937, the farms were selling 30,000 pelts per year. After World War II, changing consumer tastes caused the farms to begin breeding [[mink]] in addition to silver fox. Fur sales declined later in the 20th century, and farms sold their last pelts in 1985.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Heggland|first1=Timothy F.|title=Nieman, Edwin J. Sr., House|url={{NRHP url|id=96000418}}|accessdate=2017-02-11|work=[[NRHP]] Inventory-Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|date=1995-01-05}}</ref>

The mid-to-late 20th century saw diversification in Mequon's economy. Retail stores opened to serve the increasingly suburban community, and manufacturers opened plants. In 1983, [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] moved from its campus in Milwaukee to a newly acquired campus in Mequon. In 1994, St. Mary's Hospital Ozaukee opened. As of 2015, the two institutions—both located in close proximity to [[Interstate 43]]—were among the largest employers in Ozaukee County. Despite the growth of new industries, half of Mequon's land remains undeveloped and agriculture continues to play a significant role in the local economy.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/>

{{short description|Depopulation in humans is a reduction in a human population caused by events such as long-term demographic trends}}

A '''population decline''' (or '''depopulation''') in [[human]]s is a reduction in a human population caused by events such as long-term demographic trends, as in [[sub-replacement fertility]], emigration, for example as a result of [[Recession|economic recession]], [[urban decay]], [[rural flight]], food resource decline<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/bystrc/pub/pimentel.pdf|title=Human population numbers as a function of food supply|work=Russel Hopfenburg, David Pimentel, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA;2Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA}}</ref> or high death rates due to violence, disease, or other catastrophes.<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/depopulation Depopulate] - Webster's Online Dictionary</ref> Depopulation in humans can be largely beneficial for a region, allocating more resources with less or no competition for the new population.

From Countdown by Professor Alan Weisman</ref> with benefits being similar to the [[Reconstruction era|post-Civil War]] [[Gilded Age]], [[Roaring Twenties|post-World War I economic boom]], and the [[Post–World War II economic expansion|post-World War II economic boom]].

==Causes==
A reduction over time in a region's population can be caused by several factors including [[sub-replacement fertility]] (along with limited [[immigration]]), heavy [[emigration]], [[disease]], [[famine]], and [[war]]. History is replete with examples of large-scale depopulations. Many wars, for example, have been accompanied by significant depopulations. Before the 20th century, population decline was mostly due to disease, starvation, epidemic or emigration. The [[Black Death]] in Europe, the arrival of [[Old World]] diseases to the [[Americas]], the [[tsetse fly]] invasion of the [[Waterberg Massif]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] all caused sizable population declines. In modern times, the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] caused declines in the population of some African countries. Less frequently, population declines are caused by [[genocide]] or mass [[execution]]; for example, in the 1970s, the population of [[Cambodia]] declined because of wide-scale executions by the [[Khmer Rouge]].

==Underpopulation==
Sometimes the term '''underpopulation''' is applied to a specific economic system does not refer to [[carrying capacity]], and is not a term in opposition to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], which deals with the total possible population  can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. \"Underpopulation\" is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic employed to imply that the [[transfer payment]] schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a [[social security]] system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Positive effects of a population decline==
A long-term decline in birth rates has a positive effect on the labour market due a decreasing number of job applicants. A phenomenon of a declining youth unemployment was observed in Germany in 2010 and 2011.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/jobundberuf/0,1518,755427,00.html ''Geburtenrückgang entspannt Ausbildungsmarkt.''] at: ''Spiegel Online.'' Apr 6, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.bmbf.de/de/berufsbildungsbericht.php ''Berufsbildungsbericht 2012: Ausbildungslage für junge Menschen hat sich weiter verbessert''] at: ''[[Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung]].'' Oct 15, 2011.</ref>
From population decline the competition for resources within the population is reduced. Population decline also can rise the income per capita.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/human-sacrifice-may-have-helped-societies-become-more-complex</ref><ref>http://msh.councilforeconed.org/documents/978-1-56183-758-8-activity-lesson-15.pdf</ref> Additionally, the life quality increases due to lower motorised traffic, less environmental destruction, reduced carbon and nitrogen emissions, reduced pollution, [[reforestation]] and better air and water quality due to industries operating for fewer hours and increased carbon sinks. <ref>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/31/european-colonization-of-americas-helped-cause-climate-change</ref>

The human [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth is estimated to 500 million according to the [[National Strategy for a Sustainable America]], other authors estimate 1 to 12 billion. According to these studies, the human carrying capacity is already exceeded or would be exceeded by 2100,<ref>http://lab.rockefeller.edu/cohenje/PDFs/226CohenHumanCacience19951.pdf<nowiki/>Joel E. Cohen: Population Growth and Earth's Human Carrying Capacity. In: Science. 269 (1995), S. 341–346.</ref> therefore a global population decline would counteract the negative effects of [[human overpopulation]].

==Changing historic trends in world population growth==
{{Main|World population estimates}}
From pre-history (cir 10,000 BC) to the beginning of the [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] Period (generally 1500 – 1800), [[World population estimates|world population]] grew very slowly, around 0.04% per year.  During that period, population growth was governed by conditions now labeled the “[[Malthusian trap|Malthusian Trap]]”.

After 1700, driven by increases in human productivity produced by the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[World population estimates|population growth]] accelerated to around 0.6% per year, a rate that was over ten times the rate of population growth of the previous 12,000 years. This rapid increase in global population caused Malthus and others to raise the first concerns about “[[Human overpopulation#History%20of%20concern|overpopulation]]”.

After World War I birth rates in the United States and many European countries fell below replacement level.  This prompted concern about population decline.<ref name=\":2\" /> The recovery of the birth rate in most western countries around 1940 that produced the “baby boom”, with growth rates in the 1.0 – 1.5% range, and which peaked in 1962 at 2.1% per year,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=How The World Survived the Population Bomb: Lessons From 50 Years of Extraordinary Demographic History|last=Lam|first=David|journal = Demography|volume = 48|issue = 4|pages = 1231–1262|date=Nov 2011|pmc = 3777609|pmid = 22005884|doi = 10.1007/s13524-011-0070-z}}</ref> temporarily dispelled prior concerns about population decline, and the world was once again fearful of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

But, after 1962 the global population growth rate started a long decline and today (the period 2015-2020) is estimated to be about 1.1%,<ref name=\":3\" /> half of its peak in 1962. Although [[Population momentum|still growing]], global population is predicted to level out around the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century,<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/|title=World Population Prospects 2019, Population Data, File: Population Growth Rate, Medium Variant Fertility tab|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Population Division|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and some sources predict the start of a decline before then.<ref name=\":2\" />  The principle cause of this phenomenon is the abrupt decline in the global [[total fertility rate]], from 5.0 in 1960 to 2.5 in 2016. The decline in the total fertility rate has occurred in every region of the world and has brought renewed concern for population decline.<ref name=\":2\" />

The era of rapid global population increase, and concomitant concern about a population explosion, has been a relative short one compared with the span of human history.  It began roughly at the beginning of the industrial revolution and appears to be now drawing to a close in the [[Western world]].<ref name=\":2\" />

==Interpretation of statistical data==
Statistical data, especially those comparing only two sets of figures, can be misleading and may require careful interpretation. For instance a nation's population could have been increasing, but a one-off event could have resulted in a short-term decline; or vice versa. Nations can acquire territory or lose territory, and groups of people can acquire or lose citizenship, e.g. [[statelessness|stateless]] persons, indigenous people, and illegal immigrants or long-stay foreign residents. Political instability can make it difficult to conduct a census in certain regions. Further, a country's population could rise in summer and decline in winter as deaths increase in winter in cold regions; a long census interval could show a rise in population when the population has already tipped into decline.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Contemporary decline by country==
The table below shows that a number of countries are declining in population, in particular [[Puerto Rico]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Venezuela]]. 

The term population used here is based on the ''de facto'' definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship, except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of the country of origin. This means that population growth in this table includes net changes from immigration and emigration. For a table of natural population changes, see [[list of countries by natural increase]].

==Long-term future trends==
{{Main|Projections of population growth}}
A long-term population decline is typically caused by [[sub-replacement fertility]], coupled with a net immigration rate that fails to compensate the excess of deaths over births.<ref name=\"Bonin\">{{cite book|last=Bonin|first=Holger|title=Generational accounting: theory and application|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-3-540-42266-2|location=https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=isbn:9783540422662|pages=}}</ref> A long-term decline is accompanied by [[population aging]] and creates an increase in the ratio of [[Pensioner|retirees]] to workers and children.<ref name=\"Bonin\"/> When a sub-replacement fertility rate remains constant, population decline accelerates over the long term.<ref name=\"Bonin\"/> 

Because of the global decline in the fertility rate, projections of future global population show a marked slowing of population growth and the possibility of long-term decline.<ref name=\":4\" />

The table below summarizes the United Nations' predictions of future population growth.  The UN divides the world into six regions.  Their forecast shows that during the period 2045-2050 Europe's population will be in decline and all other regions will experience significant reductions in growth.  Furthermore, the UN predicts that by the end of the 21st century (the period 2095-2100) three of these regions will be showing population decline and global population growth will be zero.

The table shows that the UN predicts long-term decline of population growth rates in every region; however, short-term baby booms and healthcare improvements, among other factors, can cause reversals of trends. Population declines in Russia (1995-2010), Germany (1975-1985), and Ireland (1950-1960) have seen long-term reversals.<ref name=\":3\" />  The UK, having seen almost zero growth during the period 1975-1985, is now (2015-2020) growing at 0.6% per year.<ref name=\":3\" />  
===United States===
Despite ever increasing population in the United States, some American municipalities have shrunk due to [[urban decay]] in large cities and [[rural flight]] in smaller towns. [[Detroit#Demographics|Detroit]] is the most notable of a number of cities with population smaller than in 1950 and whose population shrinkage has been the most dramatic; Detroit's population was almost 1.85 million as of the 1950 census but has plummeted to 677,000 as of 2015, with the most rapid decline occurring between 2000 and 2010.

Other American cities whose populations have shrunk substantially since the 1950s—although some have begun to grow again—include [[New Orleans]]; [[St. Louis]]; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; [[Philadelphia]]; [[Baltimore]]; [[Chicago]]; [[Cleveland]]; [[Pittsburgh]]; and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington (Delaware)]].

===Japan===
{{main|Aging of Japan}}
Though Japan's population has been predicted to decline for years, and its monthly and even annual estimates have shown a decline in the past, the 2010 census result figure was slightly higher, at just above 128 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/Csvdl.do?sinfid=000008640423|title=政府統計の総合窓口　GL08020104|website=www.e-stat.go.jp}}</ref> than the 2005 census. Factors implicated in the higher figures were more Japanese returnees than expected as well as changes to the methodology of data collection. The official count put the population as of October 1, 2015, at 127.1 million, down by 947,000 or 0.7% from the previous census in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-shrinking-of-japan-1456482692|title=Japan's Net Loss: 947,000 People|first=Jun|last=Hongo|date=26 February 2016|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/jinsui/tsuki/index.htm|title=Statistics Bureau Home Page/Population Estimates Monthly Report|website=www.stat.go.jp|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref> The gender ratio is increasingly skewed; some 106 women per 100 men live in Japan.

===Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics===
{{main|Aging of Europe|Russian Cross}}
Population is falling due to health factors and low replacement, as well as emigration of ethnic Russians to Russia. Exceptions to this rule are in those ex-Soviet states that have a Muslim majority ([[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Azerbaijan]]), where high birth rates are traditional. Much of Eastern Europe has lost population due to migration to Western Europe. In [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Russia]], [[Wiktionary:natality|natality]] fell abruptly after [[History of Russia (1991–present)|the end of the Soviet Union]], and death rates generally rose. Together these nations occupy over {{convert|8|e6mi2|e6km2|order=flip|abbr=unit}} and are home to over 400 million people (less than six percent of the world population), but if current trends continue, more of the developed world and some of the developing world could join this trend.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Belarus's population peaked at 10,151,806 in 1989 Census, and declined to 9,480,868 as of 2015 as estimated by the state statistical service.<ref>http://news.belta.by/en/news/society?id=688366</ref> This represents a 7.1% decline since the peak census figure.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
Bosnia and Herzegovina's population is thought to have peaked at 4,377,033 in 1991 Census, shortly before splitting from [[Yugoslavia]] before the ensuing war.

The main reasons for the decline since 1991 are: low birth rates, emigration and [[war in Croatia]]. From 2001 and 2011 main reason for the drop in population is due to a difference in definition of permanent residency used in censuses till 2001 (censuses of 1948, 1953, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001) and the one used in 2011.<ref name=\"Notes on methodology Census 2011\"/>

This represents a 25.5% decline since the peak census figure, only one of two nations worldwide falling below 1950 levels. The decline is caused by both a negative natural population growth (more deaths than births) and a negative [[net migration rate]].

===Halted declines===

====Russia====
{{Further|Russian Cross}}
The decline in Russia's total population is among the largest in numbers, but not in percentage. After having peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, the population then decreased, falling to 142,737,196 by 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbsd.gks.ru/|title=Интерактивная витрина|website=cbsd.gks.ru|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref> This represents a 4.0% decrease in total population since the peak census figure. However, since then the Russian population has risen to 146,870,000 in 2018. This recent trend can be attributed to a lower death rate, higher birth rate, the annexation of Crimea and continued immigration, mostly from Ukraine and Armenia. It is some 40% above the 1950 population.<ref name=\"geohive\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tass.com/society/1041670|title=How Russia's population changed over the years|website=TASS}}</ref>

====Ireland====
In the current area of the [[Republic of Ireland]], the population has fluctuated dramatically. The population of Ireland was 8 million in 1841, but it dropped due to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] and later emigration. The population of the Republic of Ireland hit bottom at 2.8 million in the 1961 census, but it then rose and in 2011 it was 4.58 million. As of 2020 it is estimated to be just under 5 million according to the country's Central Statistics Office <ref>https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/pme/populationandmigrationestimatesapril2019/</ref>

Possible benefits include:

*Higher wages due to more demand for fewer workers.
*More [[Automation|labor-saving technologies]] to make up for the shortfall in workers
*More money available for investment in [[human capital]]
*Lower rents and commodity prices, which benefits lower-class consumers

Conversely, the effects of a declining population can be positive. The single best gauge of economic success is the growth of GDP per person, not total GDP.<ref name=\":1\" /> GDP per person (also known as GDP per capita or per capita GDP) is a rough proxy for average living standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth|title=Economic Growth|last=Roser|first=Max|date=2019|website=Our World In Data|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A country can both increase its average living standard and grow total GDP even though its population growth is low or even negative. The economies of both [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] went into recovery around the time their populations began to decline (2003–2006). In other words, both the total and per capita GDP in both countries grew more rapidly after 2005 than before. [[Russia]]'s economy also began to grow rapidly from 1999 onward, even though its population had been shrinking since 1992–93.<ref>Nicholas Eberstadt. 2005. \"Russia, the Sick Man of Europe\".

Such renewed growth calls into question the conventional wisdom that economic growth requires population growth, or that economic growth is impossible during a population decline. 

More recently (2009–2017) Japan has experienced a higher growth of GDP per capita than the United States, even though its population declined over that period.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=10852462|title=Grossly distorted picture|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=The Economist}}</ref> In the United States, the relationship between population growth and growth of GDP per capita has been found to be empirically insignificant.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Florida |first1=Richard |title=The Great Growth Disconnect: Population Growth Does Not Equal Economic Growth |url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2013/09/great-growth-disconnect-population-growth-does-not-equal-economic-growth/5860/ |website=CityLab}}</ref> All of this is further proof that individual prosperity can grow during periods of population decline.

Predictions of the ''net'' economic (and other) effects from a slow and continuous population decline (e.g. due to low fertility rates) are mainly theoretical since such a phenomenon is a relatively new and unprecedented one. A recent meta-study found no relationship between population growth and economic growth.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Derek D.

In an attempt to better understand the economic impact of these pluses and minuses, Lee et al. analyzed data from 40 countries. They found that fertility well above replacement and population growth would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and population stability would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labor force is taken into account.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Ronald|last2=Mason|first2=Andrew|last3=members of the NTA Network|title=Is Low Fertility Really a Problem?

A smaller national population can also have geo-strategic effects, but the correlation between population and [[power (international relations)|power]] is a tenuous one. Technology and resources often play more significant roles.  Since WWII the “static” theory saw a population's absolute size as being one of the components of a country’s national power.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1088/MR1088.chap2.html|title=The Evolving View of Population as a National Security Variable|last=|first=|date=2000|website=Rand Corporation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> More recently, the \"human capital\" theory has emerged.  This view holds that the quality and skill level of a labor force and the technology and resources available to it are more important than simply a nation's population size.<ref name=\":5\" />

Many European countries, including [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Elterngeld|Germany]] and [[Poland]], have offered some combination of bonuses and monthly payments to families.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Paid [[Parental leave|maternity and paternity leave policies]] can also be used as an incentive. Sweden built up an extensive [[welfare state]] from the 1930s and onward, partly as a consequence of the debate following ''[[Crisis in the Population Question]]'', published in 1934. Today, Sweden has extensive parental leave where parents are entitled to share 16 months' paid leave per child, the cost divided between both employer and State.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Many nations that are currently witnessing depopulation with fertility rates below sub-placement (like the west) are recommending [[quantitative easing]] to combat deflation, while other economists, such as Paul Krugman, believe governments should prioritize [[fiscal policy]], such as bringing back [[Keynesian]] policies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Alternative concept relative to skills==
{{main|Brain drain}}
Sometimes the concept of population decline is applied where there has been considerable emigration of skilled professionals. In such a case, the government may have ceased to reward or value certain skills (e.g. science, medicine and engineering), and sectors of the economy such as health care and technology may go into decline. Such characterizations have been made of [[Italy]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Russia]] in the period starting about 1990.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

{{short description|Depopulation in humans is a reduction in a human population caused by events such as long-term demographic trends}}

A '''population decline''' (or '''depopulation''') in [[human]]s is a reduction in a human population caused by events such as long-term demographic trends, as in [[sub-replacement fertility]], emigration, for example as a result of [[Recession|economic recession]], [[urban decay]], [[rural flight]], food resource decline<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/bystrc/pub/pimentel.pdf|title=Human population numbers as a function of food supply|work=Russel Hopfenburg, David Pimentel, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA;2Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA}}</ref> or high death rates due to violence, disease, or other catastrophes.<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/depopulation Depopulate] - Webster's Online Dictionary</ref> Depopulation in humans can be largely beneficial for a region, allocating more resources with less or no competition for the new population.

==Causes==
A reduction over time in a region's population can be caused by several factors including [[sub-replacement fertility]] (along with limited [[immigration]]), heavy [[emigration]], [[disease]], [[famine]], and [[war]]. History is replete with examples of large-scale depopulations. Many wars, for example, have been accompanied by significant depopulations. Before the 20th century, population decline was mostly due to disease, starvation, epidemic or emigration. The [[Black Death]] in Europe, the arrival of [[Old World]] diseases to the [[Americas]], the [[tsetse fly]] invasion of the [[Waterberg Massif]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] all caused sizable population declines. In modern times, the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] caused declines in the population of some African countries. Less frequently, population declines are caused by [[genocide]] or mass [[execution]]; for example, in the 1970s, the population of [[Cambodia]] declined because of wide-scale executions by the [[Khmer Rouge]].

==Underpopulation==
Sometimes the term '''underpopulation''' is applied to a specific economic system does not refer to [[carrying capacity]], and is not a term in opposition to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], which deals with the total possible population  can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. \"Underpopulation\" is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic employed to imply that the [[transfer payment]] schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a [[social security]] system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Positive effects of a population decline==
A long-term decline in birth rates has a positive effect on the labour market due a decreasing number of job applicants. A phenomenon of a declining youth unemployment was observed in Germany in 2010 and 2011.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/jobundberuf/0,1518,755427,00.html ''Geburtenrückgang entspannt Ausbildungsmarkt.''] at: ''Spiegel Online.'' Apr 6, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.bmbf.de/de/berufsbildungsbericht.php ''Berufsbildungsbericht 2012: Ausbildungslage für junge Menschen hat sich weiter verbessert''] at: ''[[Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung]].'' Oct 15, 2011.</ref>
From population decline the competition for resources within the population is reduced. Population decline also can rise the income per capita.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/human-sacrifice-may-have-helped-societies-become-more-complex</ref><ref>http://msh.councilforeconed.org/documents/978-1-56183-758-8-activity-lesson-15.pdf</ref> Additionally, the life quality increases due to lower motorised traffic, less environmental destruction, reduced carbon and nitrogen emissions, reduced pollution, [[reforestation]] and better air and water quality due to industries operating for fewer hours and increased carbon sinks. <ref>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/31/european-colonization-of-americas-helped-cause-climate-change</ref>

The human [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth is estimated to 500 million according to the [[National Strategy for a Sustainable America]], other authors estimate 1 to 12 billion. According to these studies, the human carrying capacity is already exceeded or would be exceeded by 2100,<ref>http://lab.rockefeller.edu/cohenje/PDFs/226CohenHumanCacience19951.pdf<nowiki/>Joel E. Cohen: Population Growth and Earth's Human Carrying Capacity. In: Science. 269 (1995), S. 341–346.</ref> therefore a global population decline would counteract the negative effects of [[human overpopulation]].

==Changing historic trends in world population growth==
{{Main|World population estimates}}
From pre-history (cir 10,000 BC) to the beginning of the [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] Period (generally 1500 – 1800), [[World population estimates|world population]] grew very slowly, around 0.04% per year.  During that period, population growth was governed by conditions now labeled the “[[Malthusian trap|Malthusian Trap]]”.

After 1700, driven by increases in human productivity produced by the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[World population estimates|population growth]] accelerated to around 0.6% per year, a rate that was over ten times the rate of population growth of the previous 12,000 years. This rapid increase in global population caused Malthus and others to raise the first concerns about “[[Human overpopulation#History%20of%20concern|overpopulation]]”.

After World War I birth rates in the United States and many European countries fell below replacement level.  This prompted concern about population decline.<ref name=\":2\" /> The recovery of the birth rate in most western countries around 1940 that produced the “baby boom”, with growth rates in the 1.0 – 1.5% range, and which peaked in 1962 at 2.1% per year,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=How The World Survived the Population Bomb: Lessons From 50 Years of Extraordinary Demographic History|last=Lam|first=David|journal = Demography|volume = 48|issue = 4|pages = 1231–1262|date=Nov 2011|pmc = 3777609|pmid = 22005884|doi = 10.1007/s13524-011-0070-z}}</ref> temporarily dispelled prior concerns about population decline, and the world was once again fearful of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

But, after 1962 the global population growth rate started a long decline and today (the period 2015-2020) is estimated to be about 1.1%,<ref name=\":3\" /> half of its peak in 1962. Although [[Population momentum|still growing]], global population is predicted to level out around the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century,<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/|title=World Population Prospects 2019, Population Data, File: Population Growth Rate, Medium Variant Fertility tab|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Population Division|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and some sources predict the start of a decline before then.<ref name=\":2\" />  The principle cause of this phenomenon is the abrupt decline in the global [[total fertility rate]], from 5.0 in 1960 to 2.5 in 2016. The decline in the total fertility rate has occurred in every region of the world and has brought renewed concern for population decline.<ref name=\":2\" />

The era of rapid global population increase, and concomitant concern about a population explosion, has been a relative short one compared with the span of human history.  It began roughly at the beginning of the industrial revolution and appears to be now drawing to a close in the [[Western world]].<ref name=\":2\" />

==Interpretation of statistical data==
Statistical data, especially those comparing only two sets of figures, can be misleading and may require careful interpretation. For instance a nation's population could have been increasing, but a one-off event could have resulted in a short-term decline; or vice versa. Nations can acquire territory or lose territory, and groups of people can acquire or lose citizenship, e.g. [[statelessness|stateless]] persons, indigenous people, and illegal immigrants or long-stay foreign residents. Political instability can make it difficult to conduct a census in certain regions. Further, a country's population could rise in summer and decline in winter as deaths increase in winter in cold regions; a long census interval could show a rise in population when the population has already tipped into decline.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Contemporary decline by country==
The table below shows that a number of countries are declining in population, in particular [[Puerto Rico]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Venezuela]]. 

The term population used here is based on the ''de facto'' definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship, except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of the country of origin. This means that population growth in this table includes net changes from immigration and emigration. For a table of natural population changes, see [[list of countries by natural increase]].

==Long-term future trends==
{{Main|Projections of population growth}}
A long-term population decline is typically caused by [[sub-replacement fertility]], coupled with a net immigration rate that fails to compensate the excess of deaths over births.<ref name=\"Bonin\">{{cite book|last=Bonin|first=Holger|title=Generational accounting: theory and application|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-3-540-42266-2|location=https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=isbn:9783540422662|pages=}}</ref> A long-term decline is accompanied by [[population aging]] and creates an increase in the ratio of [[Pensioner|retirees]] to workers and children.<ref name=\"Bonin\"/> When a sub-replacement fertility rate remains constant, population decline accelerates over the long term.<ref name=\"Bonin\"/> 

Because of the global decline in the fertility rate, projections of future global population show a marked slowing of population growth and the possibility of long-term decline.<ref name=\":4\" />

The table below summarizes the United Nations' predictions of future population growth.  The UN divides the world into six regions.  Their forecast shows that during the period 2045-2050 Europe's population will be in decline and all other regions will experience significant reductions in growth.  Furthermore, the UN predicts that by the end of the 21st century (the period 2095-2100) three of these regions will be showing population decline and global population growth will be zero.

The table shows that the UN predicts long-term decline of population growth rates in every region; however, short-term baby booms and healthcare improvements, among other factors, can cause reversals of trends. Population declines in Russia (1995-2010), Germany (1975-1985), and Ireland (1950-1960) have seen long-term reversals.<ref name=\":3\" />  The UK, having seen almost zero growth during the period 1975-1985, is now (2015-2020) growing at 0.6% per year.<ref name=\":3\" />  
===United States===
Despite ever increasing population in the United States, some American municipalities have shrunk due to [[urban decay]] in large cities and [[rural flight]] in smaller towns. [[Detroit#Demographics|Detroit]] is the most notable of a number of cities with population smaller than in 1950 and whose population shrinkage has been the most dramatic; Detroit's population was almost 1.85 million as of the 1950 census but has plummeted to 677,000 as of 2015, with the most rapid decline occurring between 2000 and 2010.

Other American cities whose populations have shrunk substantially since the 1950s—although some have begun to grow again—include [[New Orleans]]; [[St. Louis]]; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; [[Philadelphia]]; [[Baltimore]]; [[Chicago]]; [[Cleveland]]; [[Pittsburgh]]; and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington (Delaware)]].

===Japan===
{{main|Aging of Japan}}
Though Japan's population has been predicted to decline for years, and its monthly and even annual estimates have shown a decline in the past, the 2010 census result figure was slightly higher, at just above 128 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/Csvdl.do?sinfid=000008640423|title=政府統計の総合窓口　GL08020104|website=www.e-stat.go.jp}}</ref> than the 2005 census.

===Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics===
{{main|Aging of Europe|Russian Cross}}
Population is falling due to health factors and low replacement, as well as emigration of ethnic Russians to Russia. Exceptions to this rule are in those ex-Soviet states that have a Muslim majority ([[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Azerbaijan]]), where high birth rates are traditional. Much of Eastern Europe has lost population due to migration to Western Europe. In [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Russia]], [[Wiktionary:natality|natality]] fell abruptly after [[History of Russia (1991–present)|the end of the Soviet Union]], and death rates generally rose. Together these nations occupy over {{convert|8|e6mi2|e6km2|order=flip|abbr=unit}} and are home to over 400 million people (less than six percent of the world population), but if current trends continue, more of the developed world and some of the developing world could join this trend.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The main reasons for the decline since 1991 are: low birth rates, emigration and [[war in Croatia]]. From 2001 and 2011 main reason for the drop in population is due to a difference in definition of permanent residency used in censuses till 2001 (censuses of 1948, 1953, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001) and the one used in 2011.<ref name=\"Notes on methodology Census 2011\"/>

===Halted declines===

====Russia====
{{Further|Russian Cross}}
The decline in Russia's total population is among the largest in numbers, but not in percentage. After having peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, the population then decreased, falling to 142,737,196 by 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbsd.gks.ru/|title=Интерактивная витрина|website=cbsd.gks.ru|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref> This represents a 4.0% decrease in total population since the peak census figure. However, since then the Russian population has risen to 146,870,000 in 2018. This recent trend can be attributed to a lower death rate, higher birth rate, the annexation of Crimea and continued immigration, mostly from Ukraine and Armenia.

====Ireland====
In the current area of the [[Republic of Ireland]], the population has fluctuated dramatically. The population of Ireland was 8 million in 1841, but it dropped due to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] and later emigration. The population of the Republic of Ireland hit bottom at 2.8 million in the 1961 census, but it then rose and in 2011 it was 4.58 million. As of 2020 it is estimated to be just under 5 million according to the country's Central Statistics Office <ref>https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/pme/populationandmigrationestimatesapril2019/</ref>

Possible benefits include:

*Higher wages due to more demand for fewer workers.
*More [[Automation|labor-saving technologies]] to make up for the shortfall in workers
*More money available for investment in [[human capital]]
*Lower rents and commodity prices, which benefits lower-class consumers

Conversely, the effects of a declining population can be positive. The single best gauge of economic success is the growth of GDP per person, not total GDP.<ref name=\":1\" /> GDP per person (also known as GDP per capita or per capita GDP) is a rough proxy for average living standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth|title=Economic Growth|last=Roser|first=Max|date=2019|website=Our World In Data|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A country can both increase its average living standard and grow total GDP even though its population growth is low or even negative. The economies of both [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] went into recovery around the time their populations began to decline (2003–2006). In other words, both the total and per capita GDP in both countries grew more rapidly after 2005 than before. [[Russia]]'s economy also began to grow rapidly from 1999 onward, even though its population had been shrinking since 1992–93.<ref>Nicholas Eberstadt. 2005. \"Russia, the Sick Man of Europe\".

Such renewed growth calls into question the conventional wisdom that economic growth requires population growth, or that economic growth is impossible during a population decline.

Predictions of the ''net'' economic (and other) effects from a slow and continuous population decline (e.g. due to low fertility rates) are mainly theoretical since such a phenomenon is a relatively new and unprecedented one. A recent meta-study found no relationship between population growth and economic growth.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Derek D. Headey|author2=Andrew Hodge|date=2009|title=The Effect of Population Growth on Economic Growth: A Meta-Regression Analysis of the Macroeconomic Literature|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=35|issue=2|pages=221–248|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2009.00274.x|jstor=25487661}}</ref>

In an attempt to better understand the economic impact of these pluses and minuses, Lee et al. analyzed data from 40 countries. They found that fertility well above replacement and population growth would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and population stability would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labor force is taken into account.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Ronald|last2=Mason|first2=Andrew|last3=members of the NTA Network|title=Is Low Fertility Really a Problem?

A smaller national population can also have geo-strategic effects, but the correlation between population and [[power (international relations)|power]] is a tenuous one. Technology and resources often play more significant roles.  Since WWII the “static” theory saw a population's absolute size as being one of the components of a country’s national power.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1088/MR1088.chap2.html|title=The Evolving View of Population as a National Security Variable|last=|first=|date=2000|website=Rand Corporation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> More recently, the \"human capital\" theory has emerged.  This view holds that the quality and skill level of a labor force and the technology and resources available to it are more important than simply a nation's population size.<ref name=\":5\" />

Many European countries, including [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Elterngeld|Germany]] and [[Poland]], have offered some combination of bonuses and monthly payments to families.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Paid [[Parental leave|maternity and paternity leave policies]] can also be used as an incentive. Sweden built up an extensive [[welfare state]] from the 1930s and onward, partly as a consequence of the debate following ''[[Crisis in the Population Question]]'', published in 1934. Today, Sweden has extensive parental leave where parents are entitled to share 16 months' paid leave per child, the cost divided between both employer and State.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Many nations that are currently witnessing depopulation with fertility rates below sub-placement (like the west) are recommending [[quantitative easing]] to combat deflation, while other economists, such as Paul Krugman, believe governments should prioritize [[fiscal policy]], such as bringing back [[Keynesian]] policies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Alternative concept relative to skills==
{{main|Brain drain}}
Sometimes the concept of population decline is applied where there has been considerable emigration of skilled professionals. In such a case, the government may have ceased to reward or value certain skills (e.g. science, medicine and engineering), and sectors of the economy such as health care and technology may go into decline. Such characterizations have been made of [[Italy]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Russia]] in the period starting about 1990.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The '''Ark of the Covenant''' ({{Hebrew Name|אָרוֹן הַבְּרִית|Arōn Ha'brēt|ʾĀrôn Habbərîṯ}}; {{Lang-grc-x-koine|Κιβωτός της διαθήκης}}), also known as the '''Ark of the Testimony''', and in a few verses across various translations as the '''Ark of God''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Chronicles+16-18&version=NLT|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Chronicles 16-18 - New Living Translation|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+3%3A3&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Samuel 3:3 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> is a gold-covered wooden chest with lid cover described in the [[Book of Exodus]] as containing the two [[Tablets of Stone|stone tablets]] of the [[Ten Commandments]].

===Construction and description===
According to the [[Book of Exodus]], God instructed [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] during his 40-day stay upon the mountain where God was<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|19:20|HE}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|24:18|HE}}</ref> and he was shown the pattern for the tabernacle and furnishings of the Ark to be made of [[shittim wood]] to house the [[Tablets of Stone]]. Moses instructed [[Bezalel]] and [[Oholiab]] to construct the Ark.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|31|HE}}</ref><ref>Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt, ''Moses and The Torah: Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy'', pages 85-86 (Emmaus Road Publishing, 2007). {{ISBN|978-1-931018-45-6}}</ref>  In [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] the Ark is said to have been built specifically by Moses himself without reference of Bezalel or Oholiab.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deu+10%3A1-5&version=NIV|title=Deu 10:1-5 NIV - Tablets Like the First Ones - At that - Bible Gateway|work=Bible Gateway}}</ref>

The Book of Exodus gives detailed instructions on how the Ark is to be constructed. It is to be 2{{frac|2}} [[cubit]]s in length, 1{{frac|2}} in breadth, and 1{{frac|2}} in height (approximately {{convert|131|*|79|*|79|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Then it is to be gilded entirely with [[gold]], and a crown or molding of gold is to be put around it. Four rings of gold are to be attached to its four corners, two on each side—and through these rings staves of shittim-wood overlaid with gold for carrying the Ark are to be inserted; and these are not to be removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/25-12-compare.html |title=\"Four feet\"; see Exodus 25:12, majority of translations. \"Four corners\" in KJV |publisher=Biblestudytools.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> A golden lid, the ''[[Mercy seat|kapporet]]'' (translated as \"mercy seat\" or \"cover\") which is covered with 2 golden [[cherub]]im, is to be placed above the Ark. Missing from the account are instructions concerning the thickness of the mercy seat and details about the cherubim other than that the cover be beaten out the ends of the Ark and that they form the space where God will appear. The Ark is finally to be placed under the veil of the covering.

The biblical account continues that, after its creation by Moses, the Ark was carried by the [[Israelites]] during their 40 years of wandering in the desert. Whenever the Israelites camped, the Ark was placed in a separate room in a sacred [[tent]], called the [[Tabernacle]].

When the Israelites, led by [[Joshua]] toward the Promised Land, arrived at the banks of the [[Jordan river]], the Ark was carried in the lead preceding the people and was the signal for their advance.<ref>{{bible|Joshua|3:3}}</ref><ref>{{bible|Joshua|6}}</ref> During the crossing, the river grew dry as soon as the feet of the priests carrying the Ark touched its waters, and remained so until the priests—with the Ark—left the river after the people had passed over.<ref>{{bible|Josh|3:15-17}}</ref><ref>{{bible|Josh|4:10}}</ref><ref>{{bible|Josh|11}}</ref><ref>{{bible|Josh|18}}</ref> As memorials, [[Twelve Stones|twelve stones]] were taken from the Jordan at the place where the priests had stood.<ref>{{bible|Josh|4:1-9}}</ref>

In the [[Battle of Jericho]], the Ark was carried round the city once a day for six days, preceded by the armed men and seven priests sounding seven [[shofar|trumpets of rams' horns]].<ref>{{bible|Josh|6:4-15}}</ref> On the seventh day, the seven priests sounding the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark compassed the city seven times and, with a great shout, Jericho's wall fell down flat and the people took the city.<ref>{{bible|Josh|6:16-20}}</ref> After the defeat at [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]], Joshua lamented before the Ark.<ref>{{bible|Josh|7:6-9}}</ref> When Joshua read the Law to the people between [[Mount Gerizim]] and [[Mount Ebal]], they stood on each side of the Ark. We next hear of the Ark in [[Bethel]] where it was being cared for by the priest [[Phineas]] the grandson of [[Aaron]] (where 'Bethel' is translated 'the House of God' in the King James Version).<ref>{{bible|Judges|20:6f}}</ref> According to this verse it was consulted by the people of Israel when they were planning to attack the Benjaminites at the [[battle of Gibeah]]. Later the Ark was kept at [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]], another religious centre some {{convert|16|km|abbr=on|0}} north of Bethel, at the time of the prophet [[Samuel]]'s apprenticeship,<ref>{{bible|1 Samuel|3:3}}</ref> where it was cared for by [[Hophni and Phinehas]], two sons of [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]].<ref>{{bible|1 Samuel|4:3f}}</ref>

===Capture by the Philistines===
[[File:Figures The erection of the Tabernacle and the Sacred vessels.jpg|thumb|1728 illustration of the Ark at the erection of the Tabernacle and the sacred vessels, as in Exodus 40:17-19]]
{{Main|Philistine captivity of the Ark}}
According to the Biblical narrative, a few years later the elders of Israel decided to take the Ark out onto the battlefield to assist them against the [[Philistines]], after being defeated at the battle of [[Eben-Ezer]].<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|4:3-11}}</ref> They were heavily defeated with the loss of 30,000 men. The Ark was captured by the Philistines and Hophni and Phinehas were killed. The news of its capture was at once taken to Shiloh by a messenger \"with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.\" The old priest, Eli, fell dead when he heard it; and his daughter-in-law, bearing a son at the time the news of the capture of the Ark was received, named him [[Ichabod]]—explained as \"The glory has departed Israel\" in reference to the loss of the Ark.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|4:12-22}}</ref> The mother of the child Ichabod died at his birth.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|4:20}}</ref>

The Philistines took the Ark to several places in their country, and at each place misfortune befell them.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|5:1-6}}</ref> At [[Ashdod]] it was placed in the temple of [[Dagon]]. The next morning Dagon was found prostrate, bowed down, before it; and on being restored to his place, he was on the following morning again found prostrate and broken. The people of Ashdod were smitten with tumors; a plague of mice was sent over the land.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|6:5}}</ref> The affliction of boils was also visited upon the people of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and of [[Ekron]], whither the Ark was successively removed.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|5:8-12}}</ref>

After the Ark had been among them for seven months, the Philistines, on the advice of their diviners, returned it to the Israelites, accompanying its return with an offering consisting of golden images of the tumors and mice wherewith they had been afflicted. The Ark was set up in the field of Joshua the [[Beth-shemesh|Beth-shemite]], and the Beth-shemites offered sacrifices and burnt offerings.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|6:1-15}}</ref> Out of curiosity the men of [[Beth-shemesh]] gazed at the Ark; and as a punishment, seventy of them (fifty thousand and seventy in some translations) were smitten by the Lord.<ref>{{bible|1 Samuel|6:19}}</ref> The Bethshemites sent to [[Kirjath-jearim]], or Baal-Judah, to have the Ark removed;<ref>{{bible|1 Samuel|6:21}}</ref> and it was taken to the house of [[Abinadab]], whose son [[Eleazar (son of Aminadab)|Eleazar]] was sanctified to keep it. Kirjath-jearim remained the abode of the Ark for twenty years. Under Saul, the Ark was with the army before he first met the Philistines, but the king was too impatient to consult it before engaging in battle. In [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 13:3 it is stated that the people were not accustomed to consulting the Ark in the days of [[Saul]].<ref>{{bible|1 Chronicles|13:3}}</ref>

===In the days of King David===
{{One source|section|date=January 2020}}
[[File:Morgan-bible-fl-39.jpg|thumb|left|290px|Illustration from the 13th century [[Morgan Bible]] of David bringing the Ark into Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6).]]
In the Biblical narrative, at the beginning of his reign over the [[United Monarchy of Israel|United Monarchy]], King [[David]] removed the Ark from [[Kirjath-jearim]] amid great rejoicing. On the way to [[Zion]], [[Uzzah]], one of the drivers of the cart that carried the Ark, put out his hand to steady the Ark, and was struck dead by God for touching it. The place was subsequently named \"[[Perez-uzzah|Perez-Uzzah]]\", literally \"Outburst Against Uzzah\",<ref>{{bible|2 Samuel|6:8|NKJV}}</ref> as a result. David, in fear, carried the Ark aside into the house of [[Obed-edom]] the [[Gath (city)|Gittite]], instead of carrying it on to Zion, and it stayed there for three months.<ref>{{bible|2 Samuel|6:1-11}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chronicles|13:1-13}}</ref>

On hearing that God had blessed Obed-edom because of the presence of the Ark in his house, David had the Ark brought to Zion by the Levites, while he himself, \"girded with a linen [[ephod]] ... danced before the Lord with all his might\" and in the sight of all the public gathered in Jerusalem, a performance which caused him to be scornfully rebuked by his first wife, Saul's daughter [[Michal]].<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|6:12-16}}</ref><ref>{{bible|2 Sam|6:20-22}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chron|15}}</ref> In Zion, David put the Ark in the tent he had prepared for it, offered sacrifices, distributed food, and blessed the people and his own household.<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|6:17-20}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chronicles|16:1-3}}</ref><ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|1:4}}</ref> David used the tent as a personal place of prayer.<ref>{{bible|1 Chronicles|17:16}}</ref><ref>Barnes, W. E. (1899), [https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/17.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools on 1 Chronicles 17], accessed 22 February 2020</ref>

The Levites were appointed to minister before the Ark.<ref>{{bible|1 Chron|16:4}}</ref> David's plan of building a temple for the Ark was stopped on the advice of the [[biblical prophet|prophet]] [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]].<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|7:1-17}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chron|17:1-15}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chron|28:2}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chron|3}}</ref> The Ark was with the army during the siege of [[Rabbah]];<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|11:11}}</ref> and when David fled from Jerusalem at the time of [[Absalom]]'s conspiracy, the Ark was carried along with him until he ordered [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]] the priest to return it to Jerusalem.<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|15:24-29}}</ref>

===In Solomon's Temple===
[[File:Folio 29r - The Ark of God Carried into the Temple.jpg|thumb|The Ark carried into the Temple from the early 15th century ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]
According to the Biblical narrative, when [[Abiathar]] was dismissed from the priesthood by King [[Solomon]] for having taken part in [[Adonijah]]'s [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against David, his life was spared because he had formerly borne the Ark.<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|2:26}}</ref> Solomon worshipped before the Ark after his dream in which God promised him wisdom.<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|3:15}}</ref>

During the construction of [[Solomon's Temple]], a special inner room, named ''[[Kodesh Hakodashim]]'' (Eng. [[Holy of Holies]]), was prepared to receive and house the Ark;<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|6:19}}</ref> and when the Temple was dedicated, the Ark—containing the original [[Tablets of Stone|tablets]] of the [[Ten Commandments]]—was placed therein.<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|8:6-9}}</ref> When the priests emerged from the holy place after placing the Ark there, the Temple was filled with a cloud, \"for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord\".<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|8:10-11}}</ref><ref>{{bible|2 Chron|5:13}}</ref><ref>{{bible|2 Chron|14}}</ref>

When Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter, he caused her to dwell in a house outside [[Zion]], as Zion was consecrated because it contained the Ark.<ref>{{bible|2 Chron|8:11}}</ref> King Josiah also had the Ark returned to the Temple,<ref>{{bible|2 Chron|35:3}}</ref> from which it appears to have been removed by one of his predecessors (cf. 2 Chron. 33-34 and 2 Kings 21-23).

===The Babylonian Conquest and aftermath===
In 587 BC, the [[Babylonia]]ns [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|destroyed Jerusalem]] and Solomon's Temple. There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>
{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}

In [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.

==Archaeology==
Archaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas Römer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>

Thomas Römer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas Römer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E. Levy, Thomas Schneider, and William H.C. Propp (eds.), '', Israel’s Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective'' (Springer, 2015), 223-242.</ref>

[[File:Royal Arch Room Ark replica 2.jpg|thumb|185px|Replica of the Ark of the Covenant in George Washington Masonic National Memorial]]
The Ark is first mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]], and then numerous times in [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[I Samuel]], [[II Samuel]], [[I Kings]], [[I Chronicles]], [[II Chronicles]], [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].

In the [[Book of Jeremiah]], it is referenced by [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], who, speaking in the days of [[Josiah]],<ref>{{bible|Jer|3:16}}</ref> prophesied a future time, possibly the [[Jewish eschatology|end of days]], when the Ark will no longer be talked about or be made again:

{{quote|And it shall be that when you multiply and become fruitful in the land, in those days—the word of the LORD—they will no longer say, 'The Ark of the Covenant of the LORD' and it will not come to mind; they will not mention it, and will not recall it, and it will not be used any more.}}

[[Rashi]] comments on this verse that \"The entire people will be so imbued with the spirit of sanctity that God's Presence will rest upon them collectively, as if the congregation itself was the Ark of the Covenant.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Jeremiah 3:16, Tanach|publisher=ArtScroll|location=Brooklyn, New York|page=1078}}</ref>

===Second Book of Maccabees===
{{See also|2 Maccabees}}
According to [[Second Maccabees]], at the beginning of chapter 2:<ref>{{bible|2 Maccabees|2:4-8|DRA}}</ref>

{{quote|1=The records show that it was the prophet Jeremiah who ... prompted by a divine message ... gave orders that the Tent of Meeting and the ark should go with him.  Then he went away to the mountain from the top of which Moses saw God's promised land.  When he reached the mountain, Jeremiah found a cave-dwelling; he carried the tent, the ark, and the incense-altar into it, then blocked up the entrance.  Some of his companions came to mark out the way, but were unable to find it.  When Jeremiah learnt of this he reprimanded them. \"The place shall remain unknown\", he said, \"until God finally gathers his people together and shows mercy to them. The Lord will bring these things to light again, and the glory of the Lord will appear with the cloud, as it was seen both in the time of Moses and when Solomon prayed that the shrine might be worthily consecrated.\"}}

The \"mountain from the top of which Moses saw God's promised land\" would be [[Mount Nebo]], located in what is now [[Jordan]].

===New Testament===
[[File:Cathédrale d'Auch 20.jpg|thumb|right|Carrying the Ark of the Covenant: gilded bas-relief at [[Auch Cathedral]], [[France]]]]

In the [[New Testament]], the Ark is mentioned in the [[Letter to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation to St. John]]. {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:4|NIV}} states that the Ark contained \"the golden pot that had [[manna]], and [[Aaron's rod]] that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.\" {{bibleverse||Revelation|11:19|NIV}} says the prophet saw God's temple in heaven opened, \"and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple.\"

[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] scholars connect this verse with the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] in {{bibleverse||Revelation|12:1|NRSV}}, which immediately follows, and say that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] is identified as the \"Ark of the New Covenant.\"<ref name=\"Answers\">{{cite journal|last=Ray |first=Steve |title=Mary, the Ark of the New Covenant |journal=[[This Rock]] |date=October 2005 |volume=16 |issue=8 |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2005/0510fea5.asp |accessdate=2 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002717/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2005/0510fea5.asp |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>David Michael Lindsey, ''The Woman and The Dragon: Apparitions of Mary'', page 21 (Pelican Publishing Company, Inc., 2000) {{ISBN|1-56554-731-4}}</ref> Carrying the saviour of mankind within her, she herself became the [[Holy of Holies]].

In the [[Gospel of Luke]], the author's accounts of the [[Annunciation]] and [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] are constructed using eight points of literary parallelism to compare Mary to the Ark.<ref name=\"Answers\" /><ref>https://stpaulcenter.com/studies/lesson/lesson-three-the-ark-of-the-new-covenant</ref>

[[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius]], the bishop of Alexandria, is credited with writing about the connections between the Ark and the Virgin Mary: \"O noble Virgin, truly you are greater than any other greatness. For who is your equal in greatness, O dwelling place of God the Word? To whom among all creatures shall I compare you, O Virgin? You are greater than them all O (Ark of the) Covenant, clothed with purity instead of gold! You are the Ark in which is found the golden vessel containing the true manna, that is, the flesh in which Divinity resides\" (''Homily of the Papyrus of Turin'').<ref name=\"Answers\" />

===The Ark in Islamic sources===
Chapter 2 (''Sura'' 2) of the [[Quran]] (Verse 248), is believed to refer to the Ark:

{{quote|And their prophet said to them, \"Indeed, a sign of his kingship is that the chest (''tābūt'') will come to you in which is assurance (''sakīnatun'') from your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Moses (''Mūsā'') and the family of Aaron (''Hārūn'') had left, carried by the angels.

The Arabic word ''[[Sakina|sakīna]]'' (variously translated \"peace of reassurance\" or \"spirit of tranquility\") is related to the post-Biblical Hebrew [[shekhinah]], meaning \"dwelling or presence of God\".

The Islamic scholar [[Baidawi|Al Baidawi]] mentioned that the ''sakina'' could be [[Tawrat]], the Books of Moses.<ref name=\"dict\">{{Cite book |first1=Patrick |last1=Hughes |first2=Thomas Patrick |last2=Hughes |year=1995 |orig-year=1885 |title=A Dictionary of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/?id=O84eYLVHvB0C&pg=PA624 |page=624 |location=New Delhi |publisher=Asian Educational Services |access-date=April 12, 2017 |isbn=9788120606722}}</ref> According to Al-Jalalan, the relics in the Ark were the fragments of the two tablets, rods, robes, shoes, [[mitre]] of Moses and the vase of manna.<ref name=\"dict\"/> Al-Tha'alibi, in ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'' (The Stories of the Prophets), has given an earlier and later history of the Ark.

==Possible locations==
Since its disappearance from the Biblical narrative, there have been a number of claims of having discovered or of having possession of the Ark, and several possible places have been suggested for its location.

===Mount Nebo===
[[2 Maccabees]] 2:4-10, written around 100 BC, says that the prophet [[Jeremiah]], \"being warned by God\" before the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Babylonian invasion]], took the Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Altar of Incense, and buried them in a cave on [[Mount Nebo]], informing those of his followers who wished to find the place that it should remain unknown \"until the time that God should gather His people again together, and receive them unto mercy.\"<ref>Cf. [http://bibref.hebtools.com/bibref.php?book=Deuteronomy&verse=34%3A1-3&src=1000 Deuteronomy 34:1-3] and [http://bibref.hebtools.com/bibref.php?book=2Maccabees&verse=2%3A4-8&src=1000 2 Maccabees 2:4-8].</ref>
Mount Nebo is also described in the Bible (Deuteronomy 34) as the site from which Moses views the [[Promised Land]], and apparently also is his final burial place. Mount Nebo is approximately 47&nbsp;km (29 miles) slightly south of due east from Jerusalem, near the east bank of the Jordan River.

===Ethiopia===
[[File:Ark of the Covenant church in Axum Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|right|The Chapel of the Tablet at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in [[Axum]] allegedly houses the original Ark of the Covenant.]]
The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant, or ''[[Tabot]]'', in [[Axum, Ethiopia|Axum]]. The object is currently kept under guard in a treasury near the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]]. Replicas of the Axum ''tabot'' are kept in every Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo church, each with its own dedication to a particular saint; the most popular of these include Mary, George and Michael.<ref name=\"munro-hay\">Stuart Munro-Hay, 2005, ''The Quest for the Ark of the Covenant'', Tauris (reviewed in ''Times Literary Supplement'' 19 August 2005 p. 36)</ref>

The ''[[Kebra Nagast]]'' was composed to legitimise the [[Solomonic dynasty]], which ruled the [[Ethiopian Empire]] following its establishment in 1270. It narrates how the real Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by [[Menelik I]] with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem. Although the ''Kebra Nagast'' is the best-known account of this belief, it predates the document. [[Abu al-Makarim]], writing in the last quarter of the twelfth century, makes one early reference to this belief that they possessed the Ark. \"The Abyssinians possess also the Ark of the Covenant\", he wrote, and, after a description of the object, describes how the liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times a year, \"on the feast of the great nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of the holy Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating Cross.\"<ref>B.T.A. Evetts (translator), ''The Churches and Monasteries of Egypt and Some Neighboring Countries attributed to Abu Salih, the Armenian'', with added notes by Alfred J. Butler (Oxford, 1895), pp. 287f</ref>

In his 1992 book ''[[The Sign and the Seal]]'', British writer [[Graham Hancock]] suggests, contrary to the ''Kebra Nagast'', that the ark spent several years in [[Egypt]] before it came to Ethiopia via the [[Nile River]], where it was kept in the islands of [[Lake Tana]] for about four hundred years and finally taken to Axum.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hancock | first = Graham | title = The Sign and the Seal: The Quest for the Lost Ark of the Covenant | publisher = Crown | location = New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 0517578131 | url = https://archive.org/details/signsealquestfor00hanc_0 }}</ref> Archaeologist John Holladay of the [[University of Toronto]] called Hancock's theory \"garbage and hogwash,\" while [[Edward Ullendorff]], a former Professor of Ethiopian Studies at the [[University of London]], said he \"wasted a lot of time reading it.\" In a 1992 interview, Ullendorff says that he personally examined the ark held within the church in Axum in 1941 while a British army officer. Describing the ark there, he says, \"They have a wooden box, but it's empty. Middle- to late-medieval construction, when these were fabricated ad hoc.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hiltzik |first1=Michael |title=Documentary : Does Trail to Ark of Covenant End Behind Aksum Curtain? : A British author believes the long-lost religious object may actually be inside a stone chapel in Ethiopia. |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-09-wr-237-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Jarus |first1=Owen |title=Sorry Indiana Jones, the Ark of the Covenant Is Not Inside This Ethiopian Church |url=https://www.livescience.com/64256-ark-of-the-covenant-location.html |website=Live Science |accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>

On 25 June 2009, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia, [[Abune Paulos]], said he would announce to the world the next day the unveiling of the Ark of the Covenant, which he said had been kept safe and secure in a church in Axum, Ethiopia.<ref>Fendel, Hillel (2009-06-25).

===Southern Africa===
The [[Lemba people]] of South Africa and Zimbabwe have claimed that their ancestors carried the Ark south, calling it the ''[[ngoma lungundu]]'' or \"voice of God\", eventually hiding it in a deep cave in the Dumghe mountains, their spiritual home.<ref>''The Lost Ark of the Covenant'' by Tudor Parfitt, published by HarperCollins 2008.</ref><ref name=\"time\">[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1715337,00.html ''A Lead on the Ark of the Covenant''], by David Van Biema Thursday, Time.com, Feb. 21, 2008.</ref>

On 14 April 2008, in a UK [[Channel 4]] documentary, [[Tudor Parfitt]], taking a literalist approach to the Biblical story, described his research into this claim. He says that the object described by the Lemba has attributes similar to the Ark. It was of similar size, was carried on poles by priests, was not allowed to touch the ground, was revered as a voice of their God, and was used as a weapon of great power, sweeping enemies aside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/lostark.html|title=Debates & Controversies - Quest for the Lost Ark|publisher=Channel4.com|date= 2008-04-14|accessdate=2010-03-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513034056/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/lostark.html|archivedate=May 13, 2008}}</ref>

In his book ''The Lost Ark of the Covenant'' (2008), Parfitt also suggests that the Ark was taken to Arabia following the events depicted in the [[Second Book of Maccabees]], and cites Arabic sources which maintain it was brought in distant times to [[Yemen]]. One Lemba clan, the Buba, which was supposed to have brought the Ark to Africa, have a genetic signature called the [[Cohen Modal Haplotype]]. This suggests a male Semitic link to the [[Levant]]. Lemba tradition maintains that the Ark spent some time in [[Sena, Yemen|Sena]] in Yemen. Later, it was taken across the sea to East Africa and may have been taken inland at the time of the [[Great Zimbabwe civilization]]. According to their oral traditions, some time after the arrival of the Lemba with the Ark, it self-destructed. Using a core from the original, the Lemba priests constructed a new one. This replica was discovered in a cave by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Germany|German]] missionary named Harald von Sicard in the 1940s and eventually found its way to the Museum of Human Science in [[Harare]].<ref name=\"time\"/>  Parfitt had this artifact radio-[[carbon dating|carbon dated]] to about 1350, which coincided with the sudden end of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe|Great Zimbabwe civilization]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Van Biema |first1=David |title=A Lead on the Ark of the Covenant |url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1715337,00.html |website=TIME |accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
In 2003, author [[Graham Phillips (author)|Graham Phillips]] hypothetically concluded that the Ark was taken to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the Valley of [[Edom]] by the [[Maccabees]]. Phillips claims it remained there until the 1180s, when [[Ralph de Sudeley]], the leader of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], found the Maccabean treasure at [[Jebel al-Madhbah]], and returned home to his estate at Herdewyke in [[Warwickshire, England]] taking the treasure with him.<ref>Phillips, G., [http://www.grahamphillips.net/ark/ark1.html The Templars and the Ark of the Covenant], accessed 25 December 2017</ref>

====Ireland====
At the turn of the 20th century [[British Israelism|British Israelites]] carried out some excavations of the [[Hill of Tara]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] looking for the Ark of the Covenant—the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] campaigned successfully to have them stopped before they destroyed the hill.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ivan McAvinchey |url=http://www.rsai.ie/index.cfm?action=obj.display&obj_id=153 |title=News 2006 (March 9) |publisher=Rsai.ie |accessdate=2010-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308031115/http://www.rsai.ie/index.cfm?action=obj.display&obj_id=153 |archivedate=2009-03-08 }}</ref>

===Egypt===

====Tutankhamun's tomb====
{{main|Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun}}
[[File:Arkofthecovenantatkingtutstomb.jpg|right|thumb|1922 photograph of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Photograph by [[Harry Burton (Egyptologist)|Harry Burton]] (1879-1940)]]
In 1922 in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in Egypt, the royal tomb of the [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] ([[KV62]]) was opened by [[Howard Carter]] and [[Lord Carnarvon]]. Among the artifacts was a processional ark, listed as Shrine 261, the [[Anubis Shrine]]. Almost immediately after publication of the photographs<ref>[http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/carter/gallery/HomePage.html Photographs by Harry Burton], The Griffith Institute, ''Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation: The Howard Carter Archives''.</ref> of this sensational archaeological find, some claimed that the Anubis Shrine could be the Ark of the Covenant. John M. Lundquist, author of ''The Temple of Jerusalem: Past, Present, and Future'' (2008), discounts this idea. The Anubis Shrine measures {{convert|95|cm|in}} long, {{convert|37|cm|in}} wide, and {{convert|54.3|cm|in}} high in the shape of a [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]]. The Biblical Ark of the Covenant is approximately {{convert|133|cm|in}} long, {{convert|80|cm|in}} wide, and {{convert|80|cm|in}} high in the shape of a rectangular [[chest (furniture)|chest]].

Lundquist observes that the Anubis Shrine is not strictly analogous to the Ark of the Covenant; it can only be said that it is \"ark-like\", constructed of wood,  [[gesso]]ed and gilded, stored within a sacred tomb, \"guarding\" the treasury of the tomb (and not the primary focus of that environment), that it contains compartments within it that store and hold sacred objects, that it has a figure of Anubis on its lid, and that it was carried by two staves permanently inserted into rings at its base and borne by eight priests in the funerary procession to Tutankhamun's tomb. Its value is the insight it provides to the ancient culture of Egypt.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&pg=PA67&dq=%22+ark+of+the+covenant%22+Tutankhamun#v=onepage&q=%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20Tutankhamun Lundquist, John M.

God was said to have spoken with Moses \"from between the two [[cherub]]im\" on the Ark's cover.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|25:22|HE}}</ref> When at rest the tabernacle was set up and the holy Ark was placed in it under the veil of the covering, the staves of it crossing the middle side bars to hold it up off the ground.

===Construction and description===
According to the [[Book of Exodus]], God instructed [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] during his 40-day stay upon the mountain where God was<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|19:20|HE}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|24:18|HE}}</ref> and he was shown the pattern for the tabernacle and furnishings of the Ark to be made of [[shittim wood]] to house the [[Tablets of Stone]]. Moses instructed [[Bezalel]] and [[Oholiab]] to construct the Ark.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|31|HE}}</ref><ref>Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt, ''Moses and The Torah: Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy'', pages 85-86 (Emmaus Road Publishing, 2007). {{ISBN|978-1-931018-45-6}}</ref>  In [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] the Ark is said to have been built specifically by Moses himself without reference of Bezalel or Oholiab.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deu+10%3A1-5&version=NIV|title=Deu 10:1-5 NIV - Tablets Like the First Ones - At that - Bible Gateway|work=Bible Gateway}}</ref>

The Book of Exodus gives detailed instructions on how the Ark is to be constructed. It is to be 2{{frac|2}} [[cubit]]s in length, 1{{frac|2}} in breadth, and 1{{frac|2}} in height (approximately {{convert|131|*|79|*|79|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Then it is to be gilded entirely with [[gold]], and a crown or molding of gold is to be put around it. Four rings of gold are to be attached to its four corners, two on each side—and through these rings staves of shittim-wood overlaid with gold for carrying the Ark are to be inserted; and these are not to be removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/25-12-compare.html |title=\"Four feet\"; see Exodus 25:12, majority of translations. \"Four corners\" in KJV |publisher=Biblestudytools.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> A golden lid, the ''[[Mercy seat|kapporet]]'' (translated as \"mercy seat\" or \"cover\") which is covered with 2 golden [[cherub]]im, is to be placed above the Ark. Missing from the account are instructions concerning the thickness of the mercy seat and details about the cherubim other than that the cover be beaten out the ends of the Ark and that they form the space where God will appear. The Ark is finally to be placed under the veil of the covering.

The biblical account continues that, after its creation by Moses, the Ark was carried by the [[Israelites]] during their 40 years of wandering in the desert. Whenever the Israelites camped, the Ark was placed in a separate room in a sacred [[tent]], called the [[Tabernacle]].

When the Israelites, led by [[Joshua]] toward the Promised Land, arrived at the banks of the [[Jordan river]], the Ark was carried in the lead preceding the people and was the signal for their advance.<ref>{{bible|Joshua|3:3}}</ref><ref>{{bible|Joshua|6}}</ref> During the crossing, the river grew dry as soon as the feet of the priests carrying the Ark touched its waters, and remained so until the priests—with the Ark—left the river after the people had passed over.<ref>{{bible|Josh|3:15-17}}</ref><ref>{{bible|Josh|4:10}}</ref><ref>{{bible|Josh|11}}</ref><ref>{{bible|Josh|18}}</ref> As memorials, [[Twelve Stones|twelve stones]] were taken from the Jordan at the place where the priests had stood.<ref>{{bible|Josh|4:1-9}}</ref>

In the [[Battle of Jericho]], the Ark was carried round the city once a day for six days, preceded by the armed men and seven priests sounding seven [[shofar|trumpets of rams' horns]].<ref>{{bible|Josh|6:4-15}}</ref> On the seventh day, the seven priests sounding the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark compassed the city seven times and, with a great shout, Jericho's wall fell down flat and the people took the city.<ref>{{bible|Josh|6:16-20}}</ref> After the defeat at [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]], Joshua lamented before the Ark.<ref>{{bible|Josh|7:6-9}}</ref> When Joshua read the Law to the people between [[Mount Gerizim]] and [[Mount Ebal]], they stood on each side of the Ark. We next hear of the Ark in [[Bethel]] where it was being cared for by the priest [[Phineas]] the grandson of [[Aaron]] (where 'Bethel' is translated 'the House of God' in the King James Version).<ref>{{bible|Judges|20:6f}}</ref> According to this verse it was consulted by the people of Israel when they were planning to attack the Benjaminites at the [[battle of Gibeah]]. Later the Ark was kept at [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]], another religious centre some {{convert|16|km|abbr=on|0}} north of Bethel, at the time of the prophet [[Samuel]]'s apprenticeship,<ref>{{bible|1 Samuel|3:3}}</ref> where it was cared for by [[Hophni and Phinehas]], two sons of [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]].<ref>{{bible|1 Samuel|4:3f}}</ref>

===Capture by the Philistines===
[[File:Figures The erection of the Tabernacle and the Sacred vessels.jpg|thumb|1728 illustration of the Ark at the erection of the Tabernacle and the sacred vessels, as in Exodus 40:17-19]]
{{Main|Philistine captivity of the Ark}}
According to the Biblical narrative, a few years later the elders of Israel decided to take the Ark out onto the battlefield to assist them against the [[Philistines]], after being defeated at the battle of [[Eben-Ezer]].<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|4:3-11}}</ref> They were heavily defeated with the loss of 30,000 men. The Ark was captured by the Philistines and Hophni and Phinehas were killed. The news of its capture was at once taken to Shiloh by a messenger \"with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.\" The old priest, Eli, fell dead when he heard it; and his daughter-in-law, bearing a son at the time the news of the capture of the Ark was received, named him [[Ichabod]]—explained as \"The glory has departed Israel\" in reference to the loss of the Ark.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|4:12-22}}</ref> The mother of the child Ichabod died at his birth.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|4:20}}</ref>

The Philistines took the Ark to several places in their country, and at each place misfortune befell them.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|5:1-6}}</ref> At [[Ashdod]] it was placed in the temple of [[Dagon]]. The next morning Dagon was found prostrate, bowed down, before it; and on being restored to his place, he was on the following morning again found prostrate and broken. The people of Ashdod were smitten with tumors; a plague of mice was sent over the land.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|6:5}}</ref> The affliction of boils was also visited upon the people of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and of [[Ekron]], whither the Ark was successively removed.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|5:8-12}}</ref>

After the Ark had been among them for seven months, the Philistines, on the advice of their diviners, returned it to the Israelites, accompanying its return with an offering consisting of golden images of the tumors and mice wherewith they had been afflicted. The Ark was set up in the field of Joshua the [[Beth-shemesh|Beth-shemite]], and the Beth-shemites offered sacrifices and burnt offerings.<ref>{{bible|1 Sam|6:1-15}}</ref> Out of curiosity the men of [[Beth-shemesh]] gazed at the Ark; and as a punishment, seventy of them (fifty thousand and seventy in some translations) were smitten by the Lord.<ref>{{bible|1 Samuel|6:19}}</ref> The Bethshemites sent to [[Kirjath-jearim]], or Baal-Judah, to have the Ark removed;<ref>{{bible|1 Samuel|6:21}}</ref> and it was taken to the house of [[Abinadab]], whose son [[Eleazar (son of Aminadab)|Eleazar]] was sanctified to keep it. Kirjath-jearim remained the abode of the Ark for twenty years. Under Saul, the Ark was with the army before he first met the Philistines, but the king was too impatient to consult it before engaging in battle. In [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 13:3 it is stated that the people were not accustomed to consulting the Ark in the days of [[Saul]].<ref>{{bible|1 Chronicles|13:3}}</ref>

===In the days of King David===
{{One source|section|date=January 2020}}
[[File:Morgan-bible-fl-39.jpg|thumb|left|290px|Illustration from the 13th century [[Morgan Bible]] of David bringing the Ark into Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6).]]
In the Biblical narrative, at the beginning of his reign over the [[United Monarchy of Israel|United Monarchy]], King [[David]] removed the Ark from [[Kirjath-jearim]] amid great rejoicing. On the way to [[Zion]], [[Uzzah]], one of the drivers of the cart that carried the Ark, put out his hand to steady the Ark, and was struck dead by God for touching it. The place was subsequently named \"[[Perez-uzzah|Perez-Uzzah]]\", literally \"Outburst Against Uzzah\",<ref>{{bible|2 Samuel|6:8|NKJV}}</ref> as a result. David, in fear, carried the Ark aside into the house of [[Obed-edom]] the [[Gath (city)|Gittite]], instead of carrying it on to Zion, and it stayed there for three months.<ref>{{bible|2 Samuel|6:1-11}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chronicles|13:1-13}}</ref>

On hearing that God had blessed Obed-edom because of the presence of the Ark in his house, David had the Ark brought to Zion by the Levites, while he himself, \"girded with a linen [[ephod]] ... danced before the Lord with all his might\" and in the sight of all the public gathered in Jerusalem, a performance which caused him to be scornfully rebuked by his first wife, Saul's daughter [[Michal]].<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|6:12-16}}</ref><ref>{{bible|2 Sam|6:20-22}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chron|15}}</ref> In Zion, David put the Ark in the tent he had prepared for it, offered sacrifices, distributed food, and blessed the people and his own household.<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|6:17-20}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chronicles|16:1-3}}</ref><ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|1:4}}</ref> David used the tent as a personal place of prayer.<ref>{{bible|1 Chronicles|17:16}}</ref><ref>Barnes, W. E. (1899), [https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_chronicles/17.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools on 1 Chronicles 17], accessed 22 February 2020</ref>

The Levites were appointed to minister before the Ark.<ref>{{bible|1 Chron|16:4}}</ref> David's plan of building a temple for the Ark was stopped on the advice of the [[biblical prophet|prophet]] [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]].<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|7:1-17}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chron|17:1-15}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chron|28:2}}</ref><ref>{{bible|1 Chron|3}}</ref> The Ark was with the army during the siege of [[Rabbah]];<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|11:11}}</ref> and when David fled from Jerusalem at the time of [[Absalom]]'s conspiracy, the Ark was carried along with him until he ordered [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]] the priest to return it to Jerusalem.<ref>{{bible|2 Sam|15:24-29}}</ref>

===In Solomon's Temple===
[[File:Folio 29r - The Ark of God Carried into the Temple.jpg|thumb|The Ark carried into the Temple from the early 15th century ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]
According to the Biblical narrative, when [[Abiathar]] was dismissed from the priesthood by King [[Solomon]] for having taken part in [[Adonijah]]'s [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against David, his life was spared because he had formerly borne the Ark.<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|2:26}}</ref> Solomon worshipped before the Ark after his dream in which God promised him wisdom.<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|3:15}}</ref>

During the construction of [[Solomon's Temple]], a special inner room, named ''[[Kodesh Hakodashim]]'' (Eng. [[Holy of Holies]]), was prepared to receive and house the Ark;<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|6:19}}</ref> and when the Temple was dedicated, the Ark—containing the original [[Tablets of Stone|tablets]] of the [[Ten Commandments]]—was placed therein.<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|8:6-9}}</ref> When the priests emerged from the holy place after placing the Ark there, the Temple was filled with a cloud, \"for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord\".<ref>{{bible|1 Kings|8:10-11}}</ref><ref>{{bible|2 Chron|5:13}}</ref><ref>{{bible|2 Chron|14}}</ref>

When Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter, he caused her to dwell in a house outside [[Zion]], as Zion was consecrated because it contained the Ark.<ref>{{bible|2 Chron|8:11}}</ref> King Josiah also had the Ark returned to the Temple,<ref>{{bible|2 Chron|35:3}}</ref> from which it appears to have been removed by one of his predecessors (cf. 2 Chron. 33-34 and 2 Kings 21-23).

===The Babylonian Conquest and aftermath===
In 587 BC, the [[Babylonia]]ns [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|destroyed Jerusalem]] and Solomon's Temple. There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>
{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}

In [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.

==Archaeology==
Archaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas Römer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>

Thomas Römer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas Römer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E. Levy, Thomas Schneider, and William H.C. Propp (eds.), '', Israel’s Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective'' (Springer, 2015), 223-242.</ref>

===Tanakh===
[[File:Royal Arch Room Ark replica 2.jpg|thumb|185px|Replica of the Ark of the Covenant in George Washington Masonic National Memorial]]
The Ark is first mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]], and then numerous times in [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[I Samuel]], [[II Samuel]], [[I Kings]], [[I Chronicles]], [[II Chronicles]], [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].

In the [[Book of Jeremiah]], it is referenced by [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], who, speaking in the days of [[Josiah]],<ref>{{bible|Jer|3:16}}</ref> prophesied a future time, possibly the [[Jewish eschatology|end of days]], when the Ark will no longer be talked about or be made again:

{{quote|And it shall be that when you multiply and become fruitful in the land, in those days—the word of the LORD—they will no longer say, 'The Ark of the Covenant of the LORD' and it will not come to mind; they will not mention it, and will not recall it, and it will not be used any more.}}

[[Rashi]] comments on this verse that \"The entire people will be so imbued with the spirit of sanctity that God's Presence will rest upon them collectively, as if the congregation itself was the Ark of the Covenant.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Jeremiah 3:16, Tanach|publisher=ArtScroll|location=Brooklyn, New York|page=1078}}</ref>

===Second Book of Maccabees===
{{See also|2 Maccabees}}
According to [[Second Maccabees]], at the beginning of chapter 2:<ref>{{bible|2 Maccabees|2:4-8|DRA}}</ref>

{{quote|1=The records show that it was the prophet Jeremiah who ... prompted by a divine message ... gave orders that the Tent of Meeting and the ark should go with him.  Then he went away to the mountain from the top of which Moses saw God's promised land.  When he reached the mountain, Jeremiah found a cave-dwelling; he carried the tent, the ark, and the incense-altar into it, then blocked up the entrance.  Some of his companions came to mark out the way, but were unable to find it.  When Jeremiah learnt of this he reprimanded them. \"The place shall remain unknown\", he said, \"until God finally gathers his people together and shows mercy to them. The Lord will bring these things to light again, and the glory of the Lord will appear with the cloud, as it was seen both in the time of Moses and when Solomon prayed that the shrine might be worthily consecrated.\"}}

The \"mountain from the top of which Moses saw God's promised land\" would be [[Mount Nebo]], located in what is now [[Jordan]].

===New Testament===
[[File:Cathédrale d'Auch 20.jpg|thumb|right|Carrying the Ark of the Covenant: gilded bas-relief at [[Auch Cathedral]], [[France]]]]

In the [[New Testament]], the Ark is mentioned in the [[Letter to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation to St. John]]. {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:4|NIV}} states that the Ark contained \"the golden pot that had [[manna]], and [[Aaron's rod]] that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.\" {{bibleverse||Revelation|11:19|NIV}} says the prophet saw God's temple in heaven opened, \"and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple.\"

[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] scholars connect this verse with the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] in {{bibleverse||Revelation|12:1|NRSV}}, which immediately follows, and say that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] is identified as the \"Ark of the New Covenant.\"<ref name=\"Answers\">{{cite journal|last=Ray |first=Steve |title=Mary, the Ark of the New Covenant |journal=[[This Rock]] |date=October 2005 |volume=16 |issue=8 |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2005/0510fea5.asp |accessdate=2 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002717/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2005/0510fea5.asp |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>David Michael Lindsey, ''The Woman and The Dragon: Apparitions of Mary'', page 21 (Pelican Publishing Company, Inc., 2000) {{ISBN|1-56554-731-4}}</ref> Carrying the saviour of mankind within her, she herself became the [[Holy of Holies]].

In the [[Gospel of Luke]], the author's accounts of the [[Annunciation]] and [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] are constructed using eight points of literary parallelism to compare Mary to the Ark.<ref name=\"Answers\" /><ref>https://stpaulcenter.com/studies/lesson/lesson-three-the-ark-of-the-new-covenant</ref>

[[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius]], the bishop of Alexandria, is credited with writing about the connections between the Ark and the Virgin Mary: \"O noble Virgin, truly you are greater than any other greatness. For who is your equal in greatness, O dwelling place of God the Word? To whom among all creatures shall I compare you, O Virgin? You are greater than them all O (Ark of the) Covenant, clothed with purity instead of gold! You are the Ark in which is found the golden vessel containing the true manna, that is, the flesh in which Divinity resides\" (''Homily of the Papyrus of Turin'').<ref name=\"Answers\" />

===The Ark in Islamic sources===
Chapter 2 (''Sura'' 2) of the [[Quran]] (Verse 248), is believed to refer to the Ark:

{{quote|And their prophet said to them, \"Indeed, a sign of his kingship is that the chest (''tābūt'') will come to you in which is assurance (''sakīnatun'') from your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Moses (''Mūsā'') and the family of Aaron (''Hārūn'') had left, carried by the angels.

The Arabic word ''[[Sakina|sakīna]]'' (variously translated \"peace of reassurance\" or \"spirit of tranquility\") is related to the post-Biblical Hebrew [[shekhinah]], meaning \"dwelling or presence of God\".

The Islamic scholar [[Baidawi|Al Baidawi]] mentioned that the ''sakina'' could be [[Tawrat]], the Books of Moses.<ref name=\"dict\">{{Cite book |first1=Patrick |last1=Hughes |first2=Thomas Patrick |last2=Hughes |year=1995 |orig-year=1885 |title=A Dictionary of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/?id=O84eYLVHvB0C&pg=PA624 |page=624 |location=New Delhi |publisher=Asian Educational Services |access-date=April 12, 2017 |isbn=9788120606722}}</ref> According to Al-Jalalan, the relics in the Ark were the fragments of the two tablets, rods, robes, shoes, [[mitre]] of Moses and the vase of manna.<ref name=\"dict\"/> Al-Tha'alibi, in ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'' (The Stories of the Prophets), has given an earlier and later history of the Ark.

According to [[Uri Rubin]] the Ark of the Covenant has a religious basis in Islam, and Islam gives it special significance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.urirubin.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Ark_of_Covenant.86223711.pdf |title=Traditions in Transformation: The Ark of the Covenant and the Golden Calf in Biblical and Islamic Historiography |last=Rubin |first=Uri |date=2001 |access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref>

==Possible locations==
Since its disappearance from the Biblical narrative, there have been a number of claims of having discovered or of having possession of the Ark, and several possible places have been suggested for its location.

===Mount Nebo===
[[2 Maccabees]] 2:4-10, written around 100 BC, says that the prophet [[Jeremiah]], \"being warned by God\" before the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Babylonian invasion]], took the Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Altar of Incense, and buried them in a cave on [[Mount Nebo]], informing those of his followers who wished to find the place that it should remain unknown \"until the time that God should gather His people again together, and receive them unto mercy.\"<ref>Cf. [http://bibref.hebtools.com/bibref.php?book=Deuteronomy&verse=34%3A1-3&src=1000 Deuteronomy 34:1-3] and [http://bibref.hebtools.com/bibref.php?book=2Maccabees&verse=2%3A4-8&src=1000 2 Maccabees 2:4-8].</ref>
Mount Nebo is also described in the Bible (Deuteronomy 34) as the site from which Moses views the [[Promised Land]], and apparently also is his final burial place. Mount Nebo is approximately 47&nbsp;km (29 miles) slightly south of due east from Jerusalem, near the east bank of the Jordan River.

===Ethiopia===
[[File:Ark of the Covenant church in Axum Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|right|The Chapel of the Tablet at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in [[Axum]] allegedly houses the original Ark of the Covenant.]]
The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant, or ''[[Tabot]]'', in [[Axum, Ethiopia|Axum]]. The object is currently kept under guard in a treasury near the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]]. Replicas of the Axum ''tabot'' are kept in every Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo church, each with its own dedication to a particular saint; the most popular of these include Mary, George and Michael.<ref name=\"munro-hay\">Stuart Munro-Hay, 2005, ''The Quest for the Ark of the Covenant'', Tauris (reviewed in ''Times Literary Supplement'' 19 August 2005 p. 36)</ref>

The ''[[Kebra Nagast]]'' was composed to legitimise the [[Solomonic dynasty]], which ruled the [[Ethiopian Empire]] following its establishment in 1270. It narrates how the real Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by [[Menelik I]] with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem. Although the ''Kebra Nagast'' is the best-known account of this belief, it predates the document. [[Abu al-Makarim]], writing in the last quarter of the twelfth century, makes one early reference to this belief that they possessed the Ark. \"The Abyssinians possess also the Ark of the Covenant\", he wrote, and, after a description of the object, describes how the liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times a year, \"on the feast of the great nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of the holy Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating Cross.\"<ref>B.T.A. Evetts (translator), ''The Churches and Monasteries of Egypt and Some Neighboring Countries attributed to Abu Salih, the Armenian'', with added notes by Alfred J. Butler (Oxford, 1895), pp. 287f</ref>

In his 1992 book ''[[The Sign and the Seal]]'', British writer [[Graham Hancock]] suggests, contrary to the ''Kebra Nagast'', that the ark spent several years in [[Egypt]] before it came to Ethiopia via the [[Nile River]], where it was kept in the islands of [[Lake Tana]] for about four hundred years and finally taken to Axum.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hancock | first = Graham | title = The Sign and the Seal: The Quest for the Lost Ark of the Covenant | publisher = Crown | location = New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 0517578131 | url = https://archive.org/details/signsealquestfor00hanc_0 }}</ref> Archaeologist John Holladay of the [[University of Toronto]] called Hancock's theory \"garbage and hogwash,\" while [[Edward Ullendorff]], a former Professor of Ethiopian Studies at the [[University of London]], said he \"wasted a lot of time reading it.\" In a 1992 interview, Ullendorff says that he personally examined the ark held within the church in Axum in 1941 while a British army officer. Describing the ark there, he says, \"They have a wooden box, but it's empty. Middle- to late-medieval construction, when these were fabricated ad hoc.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hiltzik |first1=Michael |title=Documentary : Does Trail to Ark of Covenant End Behind Aksum Curtain? : A British author believes the long-lost religious object may actually be inside a stone chapel in Ethiopia. |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-09-wr-237-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Jarus |first1=Owen |title=Sorry Indiana Jones, the Ark of the Covenant Is Not Inside This Ethiopian Church |url=https://www.livescience.com/64256-ark-of-the-covenant-location.html |website=Live Science |accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>

On 25 June 2009, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia, [[Abune Paulos]], said he would announce to the world the next day the unveiling of the Ark of the Covenant, which he said had been kept safe and secure in a church in Axum, Ethiopia.<ref>Fendel, Hillel (2009-06-25).

===Southern Africa===
The [[Lemba people]] of South Africa and Zimbabwe have claimed that their ancestors carried the Ark south, calling it the ''[[ngoma lungundu]]'' or \"voice of God\", eventually hiding it in a deep cave in the Dumghe mountains, their spiritual home.<ref>''The Lost Ark of the Covenant'' by Tudor Parfitt, published by HarperCollins 2008.</ref><ref name=\"time\">[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1715337,00.html ''A Lead on the Ark of the Covenant''], by David Van Biema Thursday, Time.com, Feb. 21, 2008.</ref>

On 14 April 2008, in a UK [[Channel 4]] documentary, [[Tudor Parfitt]], taking a literalist approach to the Biblical story, described his research into this claim. He says that the object described by the Lemba has attributes similar to the Ark. It was of similar size, was carried on poles by priests, was not allowed to touch the ground, was revered as a voice of their God, and was used as a weapon of great power, sweeping enemies aside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/lostark.html|title=Debates & Controversies - Quest for the Lost Ark|publisher=Channel4.com|date= 2008-04-14|accessdate=2010-03-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513034056/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/lostark.html|archivedate=May 13, 2008}}</ref>

In his book ''The Lost Ark of the Covenant'' (2008), Parfitt also suggests that the Ark was taken to Arabia following the events depicted in the [[Second Book of Maccabees]], and cites Arabic sources which maintain it was brought in distant times to [[Yemen]]. One Lemba clan, the Buba, which was supposed to have brought the Ark to Africa, have a genetic signature called the [[Cohen Modal Haplotype]]. This suggests a male Semitic link to the [[Levant]]. Lemba tradition maintains that the Ark spent some time in [[Sena, Yemen|Sena]] in Yemen. Later, it was taken across the sea to East Africa and may have been taken inland at the time of the [[Great Zimbabwe civilization]]. According to their oral traditions, some time after the arrival of the Lemba with the Ark, it self-destructed. Using a core from the original, the Lemba priests constructed a new one. This replica was discovered in a cave by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Germany|German]] missionary named Harald von Sicard in the 1940s and eventually found its way to the Museum of Human Science in [[Harare]].<ref name=\"time\"/>  Parfitt had this artifact radio-[[carbon dating|carbon dated]] to about 1350, which coincided with the sudden end of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe|Great Zimbabwe civilization]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Van Biema |first1=David |title=A Lead on the Ark of the Covenant |url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1715337,00.html |website=TIME |accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
In 2003, author [[Graham Phillips (author)|Graham Phillips]] hypothetically concluded that the Ark was taken to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the Valley of [[Edom]] by the [[Maccabees]]. Phillips claims it remained there until the 1180s, when [[Ralph de Sudeley]], the leader of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], found the Maccabean treasure at [[Jebel al-Madhbah]], and returned home to his estate at Herdewyke in [[Warwickshire, England]] taking the treasure with him.<ref>Phillips, G., [http://www.grahamphillips.net/ark/ark1.html The Templars and the Ark of the Covenant], accessed 25 December 2017</ref>

At the turn of the 20th century [[British Israelism|British Israelites]] carried out some excavations of the [[Hill of Tara]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] looking for the Ark of the Covenant—the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] campaigned successfully to have them stopped before they destroyed the hill.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ivan McAvinchey |url=http://www.rsai.ie/index.cfm?action=obj.display&obj_id=153 |title=News 2006 (March 9) |publisher=Rsai.ie |accessdate=2010-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308031115/http://www.rsai.ie/index.cfm?action=obj.display&obj_id=153 |archivedate=2009-03-08 }}</ref>

===Egypt===

====Tutankhamun's tomb====
{{main|Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun}}
[[File:Arkofthecovenantatkingtutstomb.jpg|right|thumb|1922 photograph of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Photograph by [[Harry Burton (Egyptologist)|Harry Burton]] (1879-1940)]]
In 1922 in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in Egypt, the royal tomb of the [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] ([[KV62]]) was opened by [[Howard Carter]] and [[Lord Carnarvon]]. Among the artifacts was a processional ark, listed as Shrine 261, the [[Anubis Shrine]]. Almost immediately after publication of the photographs<ref>[http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/carter/gallery/HomePage.html Photographs by Harry Burton], The Griffith Institute, ''Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation: The Howard Carter Archives''.</ref> of this sensational archaeological find, some claimed that the Anubis Shrine could be the Ark of the Covenant. John M. Lundquist, author of ''The Temple of Jerusalem: Past, Present, and Future'' (2008), discounts this idea. The Anubis Shrine measures {{convert|95|cm|in}} long, {{convert|37|cm|in}} wide, and {{convert|54.3|cm|in}} high in the shape of a [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]]. The Biblical Ark of the Covenant is approximately {{convert|133|cm|in}} long, {{convert|80|cm|in}} wide, and {{convert|80|cm|in}} high in the shape of a rectangular [[chest (furniture)|chest]].

Lundquist observes that the Anubis Shrine is not strictly analogous to the Ark of the Covenant; it can only be said that it is \"ark-like\", constructed of wood,  [[gesso]]ed and gilded, stored within a sacred tomb, \"guarding\" the treasury of the tomb (and not the primary focus of that environment), that it contains compartments within it that store and hold sacred objects, that it has a figure of Anubis on its lid, and that it was carried by two staves permanently inserted into rings at its base and borne by eight priests in the funerary procession to Tutankhamun's tomb. Its value is the insight it provides to the ancient culture of Egypt.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&pg=PA67&dq=%22+ark+of+the+covenant%22+Tutankhamun#v=onepage&q=%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20Tutankhamun Lundquist, John M.

'''Altagracia Ugalde Mota''' (born January 10, 1971), better known as '''Ana Bárbara''', is a Mexican singer, actress, television personality and model.<ref>[http://www.anabarbaramusic.com Ana Bárbara Official Website]</ref> She has become a prominent figure within Latin entertainment since her professional debut in 1994 and is one of the leading female figures in [[regional Mexican]] music.

She is recognized for her musical talent as well as her sex appeal. With a distinct vocal range, songwriting and producing talent, Bárbara has defined the modern [[Grupero]] performance and is one of the few regional Mexican acts to garner an international following that extends beyond México and the United States.

In the past two decades, Bárbara has released eleven [[studio albums]], eighteen [[compilation album]]s, over thirty music videos, and four music video DVDs. She has sold over 6 million records in Mexico, Central America, South America, and the United States; she is also the recipient of Latin music's most prestigious accolades.<ref name=\"anabarbaramusic.com\">[http://www.anabarbaramusic.com/#!biografia/c12p9 Ana Bárbara Biography Official Website]</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
Bárbara showed immense musical potential from an early age. She was particularly influenced and inspired by her older sister, Viviana Ugalde, who was a popular singer locally. Today, Ugalde represents Bárbara as part of her management team.<ref name=\"tvazteca.com\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1pkMZQ80bc Ana Bárbara – Historias engarzadas]. tvazteca.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref>

In 1988, Bárbara entered the local [[Miss Universe]]-sponsored [[Nuestra Belleza México|Miss Mexico]] beauty pageant representing her native state of San Luis Potosí and won; however, she lost at the national level.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} By then, an unknown Altagracia Ugalde moved forward and began to seize any opportunity to sing at local talent shows, and at times professionally at variety of music events and festivals. In 1990s she had the opportunity to tour overseas in [[Colombia]] and represent Mexico's [[mariachi]] music.<ref name=AllMusicBio>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p195170|pure_url=yes}} Ana Bárbara AllMusic Bio]</ref>

In 1993, Bárbara was proclaimed the ''Ambassador of Ranchera Music.'' She also earned the ''El Rostro Bonito de El Heraldo de México'' (\"The Heraldo's Beautiful Face\") award. As a result, she was invited to perform for [[Pope John Paul II]] during a Mass at The Vatican. When Mass neared its close; however, she still hadn't been given an opportunity to sing, so she interrupted the proceedings, commanded the attention of the Pope, and began to sing. After mass [[Pope John Paul II]] approached her, blessed her, and wished her luck in her career.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In 1994, she was noticed by record executives from [[Fonovisa]], one of the top labels in the [[regional Mexican]] market. After signing with Fonovisa, she created artistic stage name \"Ana Bárbara\" and launched her self-titled debut album ''[[Ana Bárbara (Ana Bárbara album)|Ana Bárbara]]''. The album was produced and largely written by Aníbal Pastor; it also included songwriting from fellow Mexican singer [[Joan Sebastian]]. Songs like ''Sacúdeme'' and ''Nada'' helped Bárbara establish herself as a Grupero star.<ref>[http://www.fonovisa.com Fonovisa]. Fonovisa. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref> Bárbara released her second album titled ''[[La Trampa (Ana Bárbara album)|La Trampa]]'' in July 1995, also produced by Aníbal Pastor. ''La Trampa'' catapulted her popularity and immediately became a commercial and radio hit. Bárbara received industry accolades as well as invitations to tour and open for some of the biggest regional Mexican artists, such as [[Vicente Fernandez]] and [[Los Tigres del Norte]]. She has appeared on important Latin American television shows such as ''[[Sabado Gigante]]'' and ''[[Siempre en Domingo]]''. Consecutive hits and popular music videos, such as ''Me Asusta Pero Me Gusta'' and ''La Trampa'', topped [[Hot Latin Tracks|''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks]] and established her as ''La Reina Grupera'' (The Queen of Grupero Music).

===International stardom===
By the summer of 1996, Bárbara broke through to mainstream international success with third album ''Ay, Amor''. The album solidified her as a successful Latin recording artist and also became her best album debut on the Latin ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"Ana Bárbara, bárbaramente sensual\">[http://www.laopinion.com/ana-barbara-baila-sensual-fans Ana Bárbara, bárbaramente sensual]. Terra.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref> ''Ay, Amor'' offered a wider appeal to her music by offering some alternate takes on Grupero, and even some ranchero flavored ballads like ''No Ha Sido Facil'', and ''Entre Ella y Yo''.<ref name=\"Ana Bárbara, bárbaramente sensual\"/> Her attractive appearance and sensual dancing style captivated [[Latin America]] audiences during promotional tours with hit singles and music videos of ''No Lloraré'' and ''Ya No Te Creo Nada''. In 1997 she released her first and only calendar. ''[[Coors Light]]'' beer also selected Bárbara as their Hispanic promotional figure for marketing and advertising. Later that year she returned to [[Miami]], Florida for the annual ''Calle 8 Music Festival'' where she was crowned \"Queen\" of the 1997 parade. In 1998, she released her fourth studio album produced by Mexican singer-songwriter [[Marco Antonio Solís]]. The album, titled ''Los Besos No Se Dan En La Camisa'', was largely a ballads album with only one Grupero-style song. It included a duet and background vocals by Solís, as well as a 1982 [[Los Bukis]] cover of \"Como Me Haces Falta\", which quickly became a popular hit. The song also dominated airwaves across [[Latin America]], [[México]], and the [[United States]]. Ana Bárbara kept up the momentum of her previous release as her popularity continued to grow. In 1999, she released fifth studio album ''Tu Decisión,'' produced by Aníbal Pastor.  One of his two songwriting credits, \"Engañada\", became the album's lead single and most popular hit. ''Tu Decisión'' was also notable in songwriting terms because it marked Ana Bárbara's debut as a songwriter.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In the same year she also debuted as an actress, starring in the made-for-TV film ''Todo Contigo,'' via Hispanic networks [[Televisa]] and [[Univision]]. The film's song \"Todo Contigo\" was included in album ''Tu Decisión.'' Music videos like \"Quise Olvidar\" grew in popularity on television shows like ''Onda Max'' and other [[music video]] television networks. The following year Bárbara became the first solo grupero act recognized by The [[Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences]] for album ''Tu Decisión,'' which received a Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Grupero Album|Best Grupero Album]].

In 2000, Bárbara took a short maternity leave when her first child, Emiliano, was born. She returned in 2001 with her sixth studio album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia.'' The Mariachi-ballad effort was a challenge to her custom Grupero style; however, industry critics who had written off Bárbara as simply \"a grupero novelty built chiefly upon sex appeal\" consequently took her and her music a bit more seriously. In the fall, she received her second Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Ranchero Album|Best Ranchero Album]]. She  participated in \"[[El Último Adiós]] (The Last Goodbye)\", a song written in memory of the [[9/11]] attacks, which included other artists, such as [[Alejandro Fernández]], [[Marco Antonio Solís]], [[Thalía]], and [[Ricky Martin]], among others. As Bárbara promoted her album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia'', she began preparations for a Grupero-style album.<ref name=AllMusicBio/>

After several years as a recording artist, Bárbara began to produce her own material. She took control of the direction of her music and began to compose, arrange, and select her own lyrics and melodies, yet followed patterns of earlier albums.

In September 2003, ''Te Atraparé...Bandido'' was released; it became one of her most successful albums to date. Soon record executives pushed for a follow-up album, and in May 2005 she produced and released ''Loca de Amar''.  She continued booking success with popular chart-topping singles like ''Bandido'', ''Deja'', ''Loca'', and ''Lo Busqué'', which dominated airwaves across South America, Mexico, and the United States, as well as on ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks.

===Selena tribute concert===
In April 2005, she participated in ''[[Selena ¡VIVE!]]'', an anniversary tribute concert held in honor of Latin music icon [[Selena]]. The star-studded event was held on April 7, 2005 at [[Reliant Stadium]] in Houston, Texas and included mainstream acts, such as [[Thalía]], [[Ana Gabriel]], [[Alejandra Guzman]], [[Olga Tanon]], [[Pepe Aguilar]], and [[Banda el Recodo]], among others. The iconic tribute was produced by Spanish-language network [[Univision]], and made history by becoming the most watched Spanish-language television special in the US. Bárbara produced and co-wrote a new version of \"[[La Carcacha]]\", which mixed Selena's original version with her Grupero signature style.

===2010–2011 car accidents===
In recent years, Bárbara remained a fixture of celebrity gossip more so because of her personal life than her talent. In July 2010, she was involved in a car accident in [[Cancún]] that left a 79-year-old woman dead; the incident sparked a media circus. Authorities arrested Bárbara's driver (bodyguard and family friend). Some eyewitnesses, however, speculated that it was Bárbara who was driving. She denied the accusations and any wrongdoing. Due to immense media pressure, Bárbara granted network [[Televisa]] an exclusive interview where she broke down in tears and offered the victim's family an apology about the accident. She also stated that on-scene police authorities allowed her to leave the scene because they had apprehended her driver. To add fuel to the fire, the victim's daughter used several media outlets to blast Bárbara and presume that it was she that was driving. Bárbara was exonerated after Mexican authorities found no evidence that could have linked her behind the wheel.<ref>[http://www.peopleenespanol.com/pespanol/articles/0,22490,2008481,00.html Ana Bárbara es exonerada de toda culpa].

'''Altagracia Ugalde Mota''' (born January 10, 1971), better known as '''Ana Bárbara''', is a Mexican singer, actress, television personality and model.<ref>[http://www.anabarbaramusic.com Ana Bárbara Official Website]</ref> She has become a prominent figure within Latin entertainment since her professional debut in 1994 and is among one of the leading female figures in [[regional Mexican]] music.

She is recognized for her musical talent as well as her sex appeal. With a distinct vocal range, songwriting and producing talent, Bárbara has defined the modern [[Grupero]] performance and is one of the few regional Mexican acts to garner an international following that extends beyond México and the United States.

In the past two decades, Bárbara has released eleven [[studio albums]], eighteen [[compilation album]]s, over thirty music videos, and four music video DVDs. She has sold over 6 million records in Mexico, Central America, South America, and the United States; she is also the recipient of Latin music's most prestigious accolades.<ref name=\"anabarbaramusic.com\">[http://www.anabarbaramusic.com/#!biografia/c12p9 Ana Bárbara Biography Official Website]</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
Bárbara showed immense musical potential from an early age. She was particularly influenced and inspired by her older sister, Viviana Ugalde, who was a popular singer locally. Today, Ugalde represents Bárbara as part of her management team.<ref name=\"tvazteca.com\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1pkMZQ80bc Ana Bárbara – Historias engarzadas]. tvazteca.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref>

In 1988, Bárbara entered the local [[Miss Universe]]-sponsored [[Nuestra Belleza México|Miss Mexico]] beauty pageant representing her native state of San Luis Potosí and won; however, she lost at the national level.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} By then, an unknown Altagracia Ugalde moved forward and began to seize any opportunity to sing at local talent shows, and at times professionally at variety of music events and festivals. In 1990s she had the opportunity to tour overseas in [[Colombia]] and represent Mexico's [[mariachi]] music.<ref name=AllMusicBio>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p195170|pure_url=yes}} Ana Bárbara AllMusic Bio]</ref>

In 1993, Bárbara was proclaimed the ''Ambassador of Ranchera Music.'' She also earned the ''El Rostro Bonito de El Heraldo de México'' (\"The Heraldo's Beautiful Face\") award. As a result, she was invited to perform for [[Pope John Paul II]] during a Mass at The Vatican. When Mass neared its close; however, she still hadn't been given an opportunity to sing, so she interrupted the proceedings, commanded the attention of the Pope, and began to sing. After mass [[Pope John Paul II]] approached her, blessed her, and wished her luck in her career.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In 1994, she was noticed by record executives from [[Fonovisa]], one of the top labels in the [[regional Mexican]] market. After signing with Fonovisa, she created artistic stage name \"Ana Bárbara\" and launched her self-titled debut album ''[[Ana Bárbara (Ana Bárbara album)|Ana Bárbara]]''. The album was produced and largely written by Aníbal Pastor; it also included songwriting from fellow Mexican singer [[Joan Sebastian]]. Songs like ''Sacúdeme'' and ''Nada'' helped Bárbara establish herself as a Grupero star.<ref>[http://www.fonovisa.com Fonovisa]. Fonovisa. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref> Bárbara released her second album titled ''[[La Trampa (Ana Bárbara album)|La Trampa]]'' in July 1995, also produced by Aníbal Pastor. ''La Trampa'' catapulted her popularity and immediately became a commercial and radio hit. Bárbara received industry accolades as well as invitations to tour and open for some of the biggest regional Mexican artists, such as [[Vicente Fernandez]] and [[Los Tigres del Norte]]. She has appeared on important Latin American television shows such as ''[[Sabado Gigante]]'' and ''[[Siempre en Domingo]]''. Consecutive hits and popular music videos, such as ''Me Asusta Pero Me Gusta'' and ''La Trampa'', topped [[Hot Latin Tracks|''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks]] and established her as ''La Reina Grupera'' (The Queen of Grupero Music).

===International stardom===
By the summer of 1996, Bárbara broke through to mainstream international success with third album ''Ay, Amor''. The album solidified her as a successful Latin recording artist and also became her best album debut on the Latin ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"Ana Bárbara, bárbaramente sensual\">[http://www.laopinion.com/ana-barbara-baila-sensual-fans Ana Bárbara, bárbaramente sensual]. Terra.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref> ''Ay, Amor'' offered a wider appeal to her music by offering some alternate takes on Grupero, and even some ranchero flavored ballads like ''No Ha Sido Facil'', and ''Entre Ella y Yo''.<ref name=\"Ana Bárbara, bárbaramente sensual\"/> Her attractive appearance and sensual dancing style captivated [[Latin America]] audiences during promotional tours with hit singles and music videos of ''No Lloraré'' and ''Ya No Te Creo Nada''. In 1997 she released her first and only calendar. ''[[Coors Light]]'' beer also selected Bárbara as their Hispanic promotional figure for marketing and advertising. Later that year she returned to [[Miami]], Florida for the annual ''Calle 8 Music Festival'' where she was crowned \"Queen\" of the 1997 parade. In 1998, she released her fourth studio album produced by Mexican singer-songwriter [[Marco Antonio Solís]]. The album, titled ''Los Besos No Se Dan En La Camisa'', was largely a ballads album with only one Grupero-style song. It included a duet and background vocals by Solís, as well as a 1982 [[Los Bukis]] cover of \"Como Me Haces Falta\", which quickly became a popular hit. The song also dominated airwaves across [[Latin America]], [[México]], and the [[United States]]. Ana Bárbara kept up the momentum of her previous release as her popularity continued to grow. In 1999, she released fifth studio album ''Tu Decisión,'' produced by Aníbal Pastor.  One of his two songwriting credits, \"Engañada\", became the album's lead single and most popular hit. ''Tu Decisión'' was also notable in songwriting terms because it marked Ana Bárbara's debut as a songwriter.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In the same year she also debuted as an actress, starring in the made-for-TV film ''Todo Contigo,'' via Hispanic networks [[Televisa]] and [[Univision]]. The film's song \"Todo Contigo\" was included in album ''Tu Decisión.'' Music videos like \"Quise Olvidar\" grew in popularity on television shows like ''Onda Max'' and other [[music video]] television networks. The following year Bárbara became the first solo grupero act recognized by The [[Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences]] for album ''Tu Decisión,'' which received a Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Grupero Album|Best Grupero Album]].

In 2000, Bárbara took a short maternity leave when her first child, Emiliano, was born. She returned in 2001 with her sixth studio album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia.'' The Mariachi-ballad effort was a challenge to her custom Grupero style; however, industry critics who had written off Bárbara as simply \"a grupero novelty built chiefly upon sex appeal\" consequently took her and her music a bit more seriously. In the fall, she received her second Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Ranchero Album|Best Ranchero Album]]. She  participated in \"[[El Último Adiós]] (The Last Goodbye)\", a song written in memory of the [[9/11]] attacks, which included other artists, such as [[Alejandro Fernández]], [[Marco Antonio Solís]], [[Thalía]], and [[Ricky Martin]], among others. As Bárbara promoted her album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia'', she began preparations for a Grupero-style album.<ref name=AllMusicBio/>

After several years as a recording artist, Bárbara began to produce her own material. She took control of the direction of her music and began to compose, arrange, and select her own lyrics and melodies, yet followed patterns of earlier albums.

In September 2003, ''Te Atraparé...Bandido'' was released; it became one of her most successful albums to date. Soon record executives pushed for a follow-up album, and in May 2005 she produced and released ''Loca de Amar''.  She continued booking success with popular chart-topping singles like ''Bandido'', ''Deja'', ''Loca'', and ''Lo Busqué'', which dominated airwaves across South America, Mexico, and the United States, as well as on ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks.

===Selena tribute concert===
In April 2005, she participated in ''[[Selena ¡VIVE!]]'', an anniversary tribute concert held in honor of Latin music icon [[Selena]].

==Personal life==

===Marriage and divorce===
In July 2005, Ana Bárbara began a relationship with [[Mariana Levy]]'s widower José María Fernández, an architect commonly known as Pirru.

===2010–2011 car accidents===
In recent years, Bárbara remained a fixture of celebrity gossip more so because of her personal life than her talent. In July 2010, she was involved in a car accident in [[Cancún]] that left a 79-year-old woman dead; the incident sparked a media circus. Authorities arrested Bárbara's driver (bodyguard and family friend). Some eyewitnesses, however, speculated that it was Bárbara who was driving. She denied the accusations and any wrongdoing. Due to immense media pressure, Bárbara granted network [[Televisa]] an exclusive interview where she broke down in tears and offered the victim's family an apology about the accident. She also stated that on-scene police authorities allowed her to leave the scene because they had apprehended her driver. To add fuel to the fire, the victim's daughter used several media outlets to blast Bárbara and presume that it was she that was driving.

===2011 third pregnancy===
After divorcing, Pirru for nearly two years, Bárbara announced in August 2011 that she was pregnant via [[artificial insemination]]. She decided to undergo the procedure after her children Emiliano and José María suggested they wanted a bigger family. She said she expected to be criticized for deciding to have a child without a father, but she would not let the criticism bother her. \"I felt my puzzle was missing a piece and now it's complete,\" she told the Méxican edition of ''¡Hola!'' magazine. Her third child was named Jerónimo and he was born in December 2011 in México City. During an exclusive interview in March 2012, Bárbara revealed the identity of Jeronimo's father to ''¡Hola!'' magazine... none other than longtime best friend, singer-songwriter [[Reyli]].<ref>[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=417379&CategoryId=13003 Singer Ana Bárbara Pregnant by Artificial Insemination].

This is a list of actors who have appeared in [[Carry On (franchise)|''Carry On'' films]].

== Regular cast ==
The following actors are considered to be the core members of the ''Carry On'' team:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewhippitinn.com/carry_on_people/|title=The Whippit Inn :  Carry On People|website=Thewhippitinn.com|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref>
* [[Kenneth Williams]] (1926–1988) (25 films, and co-presenting ''[[That's Carry On!]]'') played a range of character types, nearly always a lead character. Early roles were rather strait-laced; he then sometimes played his ''snide'' character: quite slimy and smarmy with a distinctive nasal voice. Later the haughty, proud and easily outraged elitist became more frequent and Williams' best known character type. Williams sometimes played characters of other nationalities, such as in ''Up the Khyber''. In some roles, when not actually playing his role in ''snide'' mode, Williams might deliver a single joke using his snide voice.  A running gag in many of the films was that Williams' character would be embroiled in an extra-marital affair with that of Hattie Jacques—this plot device was used to greatest effect in the hospital-based films, which gave rise to Williams' famous catchphrase \"ohhh Matron!\".
* [[Joan Sims]] (1930–2001) (24) had the longest uninterrupted run of roles in ''Carry On'' films, being in all 20 films (excluding ''That's Carry On'') from ''Carry On Cleo'' to ''Carry On Emmannuelle''. She  played a range of characters from jolly and assertive young women with sturdy moral standards (''Camping'', ''Loving'') to sexy and lusty matrons – either desired (''At Your Convenience'') or coarse and unattractive (''Henry'', ''Up the Khyber''), to a chatty glutton (in ''Matron''), a battleaxe wife (''Cleo'', ''Screaming'') and an unattractive spinster (''Doctor''). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eleven episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.
* [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] (1914–1988) (23) often played a meek, rather effete 'mummy's boy' who could suddenly erupt into riotous behaviour.  Other roles were as a strict, officious and prissy person in an authority role.  Hawtrey's characters were often bumbling and accident prone, and the victim of various mishaps and complex misunderstandings. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials.
* [[Sid James]] (1913–1976) (19) always played a lead character, usually a laconic member of the working class. His characters were often lecherous womanisers, something that caused problems in James' private life. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and four episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.
* [[Kenneth Connor]] (1918–1993) (17) often played put-upon men ranging in character from pompous to meek, and often leering.  He also provided some additional voice-work in ''Emmannuelle'' when he dubbed the dialogue of Howard Nelson (Harry Hernia). He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Peter Butterworth]] (1919–1979) (16) frequently played major roles in the films, often as a generally benign, unflappable but bumbling assistant or servant unable to see the chaos around him. Unusually for a regular, in some films, including ''Again Doctor'', ''Henry'' and ''Loving'', his role consists of a cameo appearance in a single scene. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and nine episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Hattie Jacques]] (1922–1980) (14) played the haughty matron, school senior mistress or other archetypal authority figure in several films. Later she branched out into more varied comic roles (e.g. ''At Your Convenience'', ''Loving'' and ''Abroad'', in which she played a chef embroiled in a constant battle with the stove). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Bernard Bresslaw]] (1934–1993) (14) varied between playing the clumsy dimwit or the heavy, or the lusty and bombastic \"foreigner\". In the later films his characterisation developed greater depth, such as in ''Dick'', ''Behind''. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and five episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Jim Dale]] (1935-) (11) joined the series with support roles, but quickly progressed to playing the younger, sympathetic male lead, often in the film's romance plot strand. From his debut had an uninterrupted nine-film run. After a two-film absence (''Camping'' and ''Up The Khyber'') returned for ''Again Doctor'', his final ''Carry On'' until taking the lead role in the 1992 revival film ''Carry On Columbus''.
* [[Barbara Windsor]] (b.1937) (10, including co-presenting ''That's Carry On'' with Williams) played main roles in all her ''Carry On'' appearances. Her characters were always the cheeky and saucy young blonde, often in revealing costumes. Sometimes her characters were chaste (and very often chased), some were easily swayed. She also appeared in all four of the ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eight episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Patsy Rowlands]] (1931–2005) (9) started in support roles, often as undervalued, meek and mousey secretary or assistant who undergoes transformation into a more assertive and sexually aware woman. She also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]] (1927–2008) (8) joined the series with a cameo appearance in ''Matron'', where he appears in one scene with a single line of dialogue. After an only slightly larger role in the following film ''Abroad'', where he again plays his established ''Alf Ippititimus''-type character, his roles increased in size and increasingly diverged from the familiar Alf performance. After his début Douglas appeared in all subsequent films in the original series, and was one of the few returners for ''Columbus''. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Terry Scott]] (1927–1994) (7) appeared briefly in the first film ''Sergeant'' and returned 10 years later when he played, among others, the put-upon husband (''Camping''), the barking sergeant (''Up the Khyber'') and lusty doctor (''Matron'').  Additionally, he appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials. He also filmed a scene for ''At Your Convenience'' as union big-wig Mr Allcock, which was not used in the finished film.<ref>Robert Ross, ITV-DVD edition (Trivia Notes)</ref>
* [[Leslie Phillips]] (b.1924) (4) appeared in three early films – ''Nurse'', ''Teacher'' and ''Constable'' – after which he left the series only to return 32 years later for ''Columbus'' as the King of Spain.

She appeared uncredited in ''Regardless'' and ''Behind'', while her scene was cut out of ''Loving'' before release.

== Other actors in supporting and minor roles ==
'''(In alphabetical order)'''
* [[Vincent Ball]] (2) had supporting roles in ''Cruising'' and ''Follow that Camel''
* [[Bruce Boa]] (1) ''Emmannuelle''.
* [[Martin Boddey]] (2) appears in avuncular mode in ''Sergeant'' and ''Nurse''.
* [[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]] (3) had small, unaccredited roles in ''Up The Khyber'' and ''Behind'' (in which the role of his Plasterer mostly hit the cutting room floor).  He had a larger role as Melly's Driver in ''England''.  He also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Ronnie Brody]] (2) made his first unaccredited appearance in ''Don't Lose Your Head'', followed up by the small role of Henry in ''Loving''.  Brody also appeared in 2 episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Abroad''.
* [[Jeremy Bulloch]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance as a schoolboy in ''Teacher''.
* [[Gerald Campion]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Sergeant''.
* [[Brian Capron]] (0), the future ''Coronation Street'' baddie does not appear in any ''Carry On'' films.  He does, however, feature in two episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Patrick Cargill]] (2) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack''.  ''Carry On Nurse'' is based in part on the stage play ''Ring For Catty'' which he co-wrote with [[Jack Beale (writer)|Jack Beale]].  Three years later [[Peter Rogers]] used the same play as the basis for his film ''Twice Round The Daffodils''.
* [[John Carlin (actor)|John Carlin]] (2) made just two small appearances in the film series (in ''England'' and ''Emmannuelle'').  However, before these roles he had been seen as a semi-regular performer (frequently 'camping it up') in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series, notching up six episodes.
* [[Norman Chappell]] (2) made his ''Carry On'' debut in ''Cabby'' in a role originally offered to [[Kenneth Williams]].  When Williams refused it, the part of the Shop Steward was decreased and offered to Chappell.  His other appearance was in ''Henry''.  He was also to appear in ''Loving'', but his part was edited out of the film before release.  He was more of a regular performer in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series where he made 7 appearances.
* [[Peggy Ann Clifford]] (1) was [[Tony Hancock]]'s regular, female, television sparring partner, and makes an unaccredited guest appearance in ''Cleo''.
* [[David Davenport]] (3) was a former ballet dancer whose major ''Carry On'' contribution was in the significant supporting role of Bilius the bodyguard in ''Cleo''.  He also appeared in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' and ''Henry''.
* [[Francis de Wolff]] (1) put in a supporting role in ''Cleo''.
* [[Noel Dyson]] (2) was everyone's favourite nanny in ''[[Father, Dear Father]]'', and a founder cast member in ''[[Coronation Street]]''.  She appeared in ''Constable'' and ''Cabby''.
* [[E. V. H. Emmett]] (1) brought his newsreading authority to the narrator of ''Cleo''.  Although several other films in the series used a narrator, none used them as effectively as ''Cleo'' where the conceit runs throughout the film.  Emmett was the only person to get credited for narrating a ''Carry On'' film.  He had previously been a [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont British News]] newsreader and commentator, and also provided narration for the first series of ''[[Dad's Army]]''.
* [[Hilda Fenemore]] (2) had a main part in ''Nurse'' as a snob's loud-mouthed wife, and had a cameo appearance in ''Constable'' as a woman who wanted to use the public convenience. She is best remembered as Ivy, the cleaner in ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''.
* [[Charles Fleischer]] (1) ''Columbus''.
* [[Joanna Ford]] (2) added some unaccredited sex-appeal to ''Cabby'' and ''Cleo''.
* [[Gloria Best]] (3) added some unaccredited glamour to ''Spying'', ''Cleo'' and ''Cowboy''.
* [[Judith Furse]] (3) brought her personality to ''Regardless'', ''Cabby'', and, most memorably, as Dr Crow in ''Spying'', the film's take on the traditional [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villain]].  For the latter role her voice was redubbed by [[John Bluthal]] in order to give the character a more asexual sound.
* [[Fred Griffiths (actor)|Fred Griffiths]] (3) appears as an ambulance man in ''Nurse'', and as a taxi driver in ''Regardless'' and ''Loving''.
* [[Sheila Hancock]] (1) lends her comic support to ''Cleo'' as Hengist Pod's wife Senna.
* [[Irene Handl]] (2) appeared in ''Nurse'' and ''Constable''.
* [[Sherrie Hewson]] (1) appeared in the large supporting role of Carol in ''Behind''.  However, she also made 4 appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Linda Hooks]] (3) the former Miss Great Britain had small glamorous roles in 3 later films, plus two appearances in episodes on the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Laraine Humphrys]] (2) brought glamour to ''Girls'' and ''Dick''.  Laraine also appeared in the 1975 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.
* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] (1) has a significant guest role in ''Nurse''.
* [[Vivienne Johnson]] (1) is only credited with appearing in ''England''.  However, the previous year had seen her make three significant appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Elizabeth Knight]] (2) makes eye-catching appearances in ''Camping'' (as Jane), and ''Again Doctor'' (as Nurse Willing).
* [[Ian Lavender]] (1) has a large supporting role in ''Behind''.
* [[George Layton]] (1) was probably best known at the time for playing Dr Paul Collier in the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV)|Doctor...]]'' TV series. In ''Behind'' he makes a 'gag' appearance as a Doctor.  He also co-wrote an unused script for a potential ''Carry On'' film in the 1980s. 
* [[Tutte Lemkow]] (1) brought his distinctive face to British film and television productions for 40 years.  Sadly, his only ''Carry On'' contribution was as an unaccredited walk-on in ''Spying''.
* [[John Levene]] (0) made an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in one of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV episodes.  Best known for playing UNIT soldier Corporal Benton in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', he appears briefly as a mediaeval soldier in the episode ''The Baron Outlook''.  He did not appear in any of the films.
* [[Harry Locke]] (3) was a well-used supporting artist within the British film industry.  His 3 ''Carry On'' appearances are all in medical comedies: ''Nurse'', ''Doctor'', and ''Again Doctor''.
* [[Reuben Martin (actor)|Reuben Martin]] (2) played gorillas in both ''Up The Jungle'' and ''Emmannuelle'' (the latter unaccredited).  He also donned his gorilla suit for an episode of the TV ''Carry On Laughing'' series.
* [[Derek Martinus]] (1) appeared in just one of the series, ''Sergeant''.  He went on to become a TV director of note, directing (amongst other things) 9 episodes of [[William Hartnell]] era ''[[Doctor Who]]'', 17 further episodes of ''Doctor Who'', and 2 episodes of ''[[Blake's 7]]''.
* [[Larry Martyn]] (2) had small roles in ''Convenience'' and ''Behind''.
* [[Rik Mayall]] (1) ''Columbus''.
* [[William Mervyn]] (3) has cameo roles in ''Follow That Camel'', ''Again Doctor'', and ''Henry''.
* [[Olive Milbourne]] (1) later found fame as Terry's mum in ''[[The Likely Lads]]'' (on both TV and radio), and its sequel ''[[Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads]]'', but an early unaccredited appearance was as a sexy GlamCab driver in ''Cabby''.
* [[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]] (1) ''Columbus''.
* [[Warren Mitchell]] (1) made an entertaining, single appearance in ''Cleo''.  He went on to create the role of [[Alf Garnett]] for writer [[Johnny Speight]].
* [[Trisha Noble]] (1) had a large supporting role in ''Camping'', but her role was decreased during editing.
* [[Cecil Parker]] (1) makes a guest appearance topping-and-tailing ''Jack''.
* [[Daniel Peacock]] (1) ''Columbus''.
* [[Ambrosine Phillpotts]] (2) brings an aristocratic air to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.
* [[Eric Pohlmann]] (2) brings something sinister to ''Regardless'', and shines in the supporting role of a foreign spy in ''Spying''.
* [[Brian Rawlinson]] (3) appeared in ''Cruising'', ''Cleo'' and ''Cowboy''.
* [[Linda Regan]] (1) appears as one of the ATS girls in ''England''.  Six years earlier she had also appeared uncredited in the 1970 ''Carry On Again Christmas'' TV special.
* [[Beryl Reid]] (1) made a guest appearance in ''Emmannuelle''.
* [[Wendy Richard]] (2) made her ''Carry On'' film debut in ''Matron'', following it up with a larger supporting role in ''Girls''.  However, two years earlier she had also appeared in the 1970 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.
* [[Anton Rodgers]] (2) appeared in ''Cruising'' and ''Jack''.
* [[Carole Shelley]] (2) brought 'ditzy' glamour to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.  
* [[Vicki Smith]] (3) added unaccredited sex-appeal to ''Spying'', ''Cleo'', and ''Cowboy''.
* [[Yutte Stensgaard]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance in ''Again Doctor'' as a nurse.  She also filmed a scene for ''Loving'' alongside [[Dad's Army]] star [[James Beck]], but their scene was removed from the film before release.
* [[Jimmy Thompson (actor)|Jimmy Thompson]] (3) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack'', with a large supporting role in ''Cruising'' in the middle.
* [[Bob Todd]] (1) makes an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in ''Again Doctor''.  He also appeared in the 1970 ''Carry On Again Christmas'' TV special.
* [[Nikki van der Zyl]] (2) was one of British cinema's most prolific voice-over artistes, dubbing many of the original Bond girls (including [[Shirley Eaton]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'').  She appears unaccredited in two of the films, none of them dubbing work.  In ''Cleo'' she doubles for [[Amanda Barrie]] when Cleo is rolled out of her carpet, whilst in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' she provides stunt work and appears as the messenger who brings a letter to [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] at the start of the film when he is about to be executed.
* [[Wanda Ventham]] (2) has an unaccredited cameo in ''Cleo'', and a slightly larger role as the Khasi's first wife in ''Up The Khyber''.
* [[Kenneth Waller]] (1) stepped into the role of the Barman in ''Behind'' at the last minute replacing the now unavailable [[Chris Gannon (actor)|Chris Gannon]].
* [[Geoffrey Hughes]] (1) played Willie in ''Carry on at your convenience''.

This is a list of actors who have appeared in [[Carry On (franchise)|''Carry On'' films]].

== Regular cast ==
The following actors are considered to be the core members of the ''Carry On'' team:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewhippitinn.com/carry_on_people/|title=The Whippit Inn :  Carry On People|website=Thewhippitinn.com|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref>
* [[Kenneth Williams]] (1926–1988) (25 films, and co-presenting ''[[That's Carry On!]]'') played a range of character types, nearly always a lead character. Early roles were rather strait-laced; he then sometimes played his ''snide'' character: quite slimy and smarmy with a distinctive nasal voice. Later the haughty, proud and easily outraged elitist became more frequent and Williams' best known character type. Williams sometimes played characters of other nationalities, such as in ''Up the Khyber''. In some roles, when not actually playing his role in ''snide'' mode, Williams might deliver a single joke using his snide voice.  A running gag in many of the films was that Williams' character would be embroiled in an extra-marital affair with that of Hattie Jacques—this plot device was used to greatest effect in the hospital-based films, which gave rise to Williams' famous catchphrase \"ohhh Matron!\".
* [[Joan Sims]] (1930–2001) (24) had the longest uninterrupted run of roles in ''Carry On'' films, being in all 20 films (excluding ''That's Carry On'') from ''Carry On Cleo'' to ''Carry On Emmannuelle''. She  played a range of characters from jolly and assertive young women with sturdy moral standards (''Camping'', ''Loving'') to sexy and lusty matrons – either desired (''At Your Convenience'') or coarse and unattractive (''Henry'', ''Up the Khyber''), to a chatty glutton (in ''Matron''), a battleaxe wife (''Cleo'', ''Screaming'') and an unattractive spinster (''Doctor''). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eleven episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.
* [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] (1914–1988) (23) often played a meek, rather effete 'mummy's boy' who could suddenly erupt into riotous behaviour.  Other roles were as a strict, officious and prissy person in an authority role.  Hawtrey's characters were often bumbling and accident prone, and the victim of various mishaps and complex misunderstandings. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials.
* [[Sid James]] (1913–1976) (19) always played a lead character, usually a laconic member of the working class. His characters were often lecherous womanisers, something that caused problems in James' private life. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and four episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.
* [[Kenneth Connor]] (1918–1993) (17) often played put-upon men ranging in character from pompous to meek, and often leering.  He also provided some additional voice-work in ''Emmannuelle'' when he dubbed the dialogue of Howard Nelson (Harry Hernia). He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Peter Butterworth]] (1919–1979) (16) frequently played major roles in the films, often as a generally benign, unflappable but bumbling assistant or servant unable to see the chaos around him. Unusually for a regular, in some films, including ''Again Doctor'', ''Henry'' and ''Loving'', his role consists of a cameo appearance in a single scene. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and nine episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Hattie Jacques]] (1922–1980) (14) played the haughty matron, school senior mistress or other archetypal authority figure in several films. Later she branched out into more varied comic roles (e.g. ''At Your Convenience'', ''Loving'' and ''Abroad'', in which she played a chef embroiled in a constant battle with the stove). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Bernard Bresslaw]] (1934–1993) (14) varied between playing the clumsy dimwit or the heavy, or the lusty and bombastic \"foreigner\". In the later films his characterisation developed greater depth, such as in ''Dick'', ''Behind''. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and five episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Jim Dale]] (1935-) (11) joined the series with support roles, but quickly progressed to playing the younger, sympathetic male lead, often in the film's romance plot strand. From his debut had an uninterrupted nine-film run. After a two-film absence (''Camping'' and ''Up The Khyber'') returned for ''Again Doctor'', his final ''Carry On'' until taking the lead role in the 1992 revival film ''Carry On Columbus''.
* [[Barbara Windsor]] (b.1937) (10, including co-presenting ''That's Carry On'' with Williams) played main roles in all her ''Carry On'' appearances. Her characters were always the cheeky and saucy young blonde, often in revealing costumes. Sometimes her characters were chaste (and very often chased), some were easily swayed. She also appeared in all four of the ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eight episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Patsy Rowlands]] (1931–2005) (9) started in support roles, often as undervalued, meek and mousey secretary or assistant who undergoes transformation into a more assertive and sexually aware woman. She also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]] (1927–2008) (8) joined the series with a cameo appearance in ''Matron'', where he appears in one scene with a single line of dialogue. After an only slightly larger role in the following film ''Abroad'', where he again plays his established ''Alf Ippititimus''-type character, his roles increased in size and increasingly diverged from the familiar Alf performance. After his début Douglas appeared in all subsequent films in the original series, and was one of the few returners for ''Columbus''. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Terry Scott]] (1927–1994) (7) appeared briefly in the first film ''Sergeant'' and returned 10 years later when he played, among others, the put-upon husband (''Camping''), the barking sergeant (''Up the Khyber'') and lusty doctor (''Matron'').  Additionally, he appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials. He also filmed a scene for ''At Your Convenience'' as union big-wig Mr Allcock, which was not used in the finished film.<ref>Robert Ross, ITV-DVD edition (Trivia Notes)</ref>
* [[Leslie Phillips]] (b.1924) (4) appeared in three early films – ''Nurse'', ''Teacher'' and ''Constable'' – after which he left the series only to return 32 years later for ''Columbus'' as the King of Spain.

* [[Martin Boddey]] (2) appears in avuncular mode in ''Sergeant'' and ''Nurse''.
* [[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]] (3) had small, unaccredited roles in ''Up The Khyber'' and ''Behind'' (in which the role of his Plasterer mostly hit the cutting room floor).  He had a larger role as Melly's Driver in ''England''.  He also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Ronnie Brody]] (2) made his first unaccredited appearance in ''Don't Lose Your Head'', followed up by the small role of Henry in ''Loving''.  Brody also appeared in 2 episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.

* [[Jeremy Bulloch]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance as a schoolboy in ''Teacher''.
* [[Gerald Campion]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Sergeant''.
* [[Brian Capron]] (0), the future ''Coronation Street'' baddie does not appear in any ''Carry On'' films.  He does, however, feature in two episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Patrick Cargill]] (2) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack''.  ''Carry On Nurse'' is based in part on the stage play ''Ring For Catty'' which he co-wrote with [[Jack Beale (writer)|Jack Beale]].  Three years later [[Peter Rogers]] used the same play as the basis for his film ''Twice Round The Daffodils''.
* [[John Carlin (actor)|John Carlin]] (2) made just two small appearances in the film series (in ''England'' and ''Emmannuelle'').  However, before these roles he had been seen as a semi-regular performer (frequently 'camping it up') in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series, notching up six episodes.
* [[Norman Chappell]] (2) made his ''Carry On'' debut in ''Cabby'' in a role originally offered to [[Kenneth Williams]].  When Williams refused it, the part of the Shop Steward was decreased and offered to Chappell.  His other appearance was in ''Henry''.  He was also to appear in ''Loving'', but his part was edited out of the film before release.  He was more of a regular performer in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series where he made 7 appearances.
* [[Peggy Ann Clifford]] (1) was [[Tony Hancock]]'s regular, female, television sparring partner, and makes an unaccredited guest appearance in ''Cleo''.

* [[Francis de Wolff]] (1) put in a supporting role in ''Cleo''.
* [[Noel Dyson]] (2) was everyone's favourite nanny in ''[[Father, Dear Father]]'', and a founder cast member in ''[[Coronation Street]]''.  She appeared in ''Constable'' and ''Cabby''.
* [[E. V. H. Emmett]] (1) brought his newsreading authority to the narrator of ''Cleo''.  Although several other films in the series used a narrator, none used them as effectively as ''Cleo'' where the conceit runs throughout the film.  Emmett was the only person to get credited for narrating a ''Carry On'' film.  He had previously been a [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont British News]] newsreader and commentator, and also provided narration for the first series of ''[[Dad's Army]]''.
* [[Hilda Fenemore]] (2) had a main part in ''Nurse'' as a snob's loud-mouthed wife, and had a cameo appearance in ''Constable'' as a woman who wanted to use the public convenience. She is best remembered as Ivy, the cleaner in ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''.

For the latter role her voice was redubbed by [[John Bluthal]] in order to give the character a more asexual sound.
* [[Fred Griffiths (actor)|Fred Griffiths]] (3) appears as an ambulance man in ''Nurse'', and as a taxi driver in ''Regardless'' and ''Loving''.
* [[Sheila Hancock]] (1) lends her comic support to ''Cleo'' as Hengist Pod's wife Senna.

* [[Vivienne Johnson]] (1) is only credited with appearing in ''England''.  However, the previous year had seen her make three significant appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.
* [[Elizabeth Knight]] (2) makes eye-catching appearances in ''Camping'' (as Jane), and ''Again Doctor'' (as Nurse Willing).
* [[Ian Lavender]] (1) has a large supporting role in ''Behind''.

* [[John Levene]] (0) made an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in one of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV episodes.  Best known for playing UNIT soldier Corporal Benton in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', he appears briefly as a mediaeval soldier in the episode ''The Baron Outlook''.  He did not appear in any of the films.
* [[Harry Locke]] (3) was a well-used supporting artist within the British film industry.  His 3 ''Carry On'' appearances are all in medical comedies: ''Nurse'', ''Doctor'', and ''Again Doctor''.
* [[Reuben Martin (actor)|Reuben Martin]] (2) played gorillas in both ''Up The Jungle'' and ''Emmannuelle'' (the latter unaccredited).  He also donned his gorilla suit for an episode of the TV ''Carry On Laughing'' series.
* [[Derek Martinus]] (1) appeared in just one of the series, ''Sergeant''.  He went on to become a TV director of note, directing (amongst other things) 9 episodes of [[William Hartnell]] era ''[[Doctor Who]]'', 17 further episodes of ''Doctor Who'', and 2 episodes of ''[[Blake's 7]]''.
* [[Larry Martyn]] (2) had small roles in ''Convenience'' and ''Behind''.
* [[Rik Mayall]] (1) ''Columbus''.
* [[William Mervyn]] (3) has cameo roles in ''Follow That Camel'', ''Again Doctor'', and ''Henry''.
* [[Olive Milbourne]] (1) later found fame as Terry's mum in ''[[The Likely Lads]]'' (on both TV and radio), and its sequel ''[[Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads]]'', but an early unaccredited appearance was as a sexy GlamCab driver in ''Cabby''.

* [[Brian Rawlinson]] (3) appeared in ''Cruising'', ''Cleo'' and ''Cowboy''.

* [[Beryl Reid]] (1) made a guest appearance in ''Emmannuelle''.
* [[Wendy Richard]] (2) made her ''Carry On'' film debut in ''Matron'', following it up with a larger supporting role in ''Girls''.  However, two years earlier she had also appeared in the 1970 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.
* [[Anton Rodgers]] (2) appeared in ''Cruising'' and ''Jack''.
* [[Carole Shelley]] (2) brought 'ditzy' glamour to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.

She appears unaccredited in two of the films, none of them dubbing work.  In ''Cleo'' she doubles for [[Amanda Barrie]] when Cleo is rolled out of her carpet, whilst in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' she provides stunt work and appears as the messenger who brings a letter to [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] at the start of the film when he is about to be executed.

==Early life and education==

Garrin grew up in [[Pennsauken, New Jersey]], in what he describes as a 50's cheap housing boom neighborhood, like something out of an archetypal twilight zone landscape. His understanding of hard times has its roots in childhood experience, when it became necessary for his family to seek [[public assistance]] due to his father's joblessness. A registered nurse, his mother got his family through hard times. Surrounded by a conformist mindset that seemed to care for little beyond sports, Garrin studied art as a way out. He took night classes at the [[Philadelphia College of Art]], and worked at an [[offset printing]] shop in the day to support himself.<ref name=\"MWilson\">{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Marcia |title=Video Artist Paul Garrin |newspaper=Downtown Express|date=6 February 1991}}</ref>

Garrin began working with [[video]] while studying [[fine arts]] at the [[Cooper Union]] for the Advancement of Science and Art in [[New York City]] (1977–82) where he enrolled after two years of classical art training in painting, drawing, sculpture, materials, and printmaking at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia (1977). At Cooper Union, Garrin studied with many well-known artists including [[Hans Haacke]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Robert Breer]] and [[Martha Rosler]], all of whom had a major impact on Garrin's aesthetics and critical social content in his works.<ref name=\"MWilson\" /><ref name=\"BAdams\">{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Brooks |date= 29 September 1998 |title=More than just High-Tech Video |newspaper=Hayward Gallery |location=South Bank Centre London}}</ref><ref name=\"lyon\">{{cite journal |author1=Richard Crevier |author2=John Doherty |author3=Bernard Eisenchitz |author4=Brian Holmes |author5=Laurent Muhleism |author6=Marie-Noelle Ryan |title =3e biennale de lyon d'art contemporian (installation, cinema, video, informatique) |journal =3e Biennale de Lyo |pages =22,216–219,268,442–443,522}}</ref>{{rp|219}}

In 2001, Paul Garrin (A'82), was awarded the Cooper Union President Citation for outstanding attainments and contributions to his profession, and was inducted into the Cooper Union Alumni Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"Hallfame\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cualumni.com/s/1289/indexNoRtcol.aspx?sid=1289&gid=1&pgid=468#PG82| title=Alumni Hall of Fame Profile Archive |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=http://www.cualumni.com |publisher=The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>

==Video & Media Artworks==

===Art Videotapes===
Garrin belongs to the second generation of [[video artists]] whose works mix technological innovation with social criticism.<ref name=\"MGever\" /><ref name=\"lyon\" />{{rp|219}} Along with [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Julia Scher]], [[Lowell Darling]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Nayland Blake]] and [[Douglas Davis (artist)|Douglas Davis]], Garrin was among a promising group of autonomous artists creating far-ranging works of art within the Web, tapping into the potential of the Web as a creative medium, thereby transcending the basic nature of the medium at the time.<ref name=\"MDrier\" /><ref name=\"lyon\" />{{rp|422}}

From the time he was a student at Cooper Union, Paul's video works focused on single and double channel pieces. After graduation, Garrin's work was heavily influenced by the experimental works of [[Nam June Paik]]. This influence is seen emerging in such works as \"A Place to Hide\", 1985, and a series of pieces in collaboration with musician and composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and video artist [[Kit Fitzgerald]] sponsored by [[SONY]] Corporation, 1985–86, most notably \"A Human Tube\".<ref name=\"BAdams\" /><ref name=\"aplacetohide\">{{cite AV media| people = Garrin, Paul (Artist,Director)| title =A Place to Hide [http://replace.tv/index.php?option=com_seyret&task=videodirectlink&id=2]| medium = Art Videotape| publisher = replace.TV| location = New York City| date = 8 September 2008 }}</ref>

In 1988, Garrin created one of his most groundbreaking videos entitled \"Free Society\"<ref name=MGever /><ref name=\"dokestf\">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmladen.de/dokfest_alt/alt/2008/?page_id=3255 |title=Free Society |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=10–15 November 2009 |website=http://www.filmladen.de/dokfest |publisher=Filmladen Kassel e.V. |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> featuring original music by downtown composer and musician [[Elliott Sharp]].<ref name=\"BAdams\" /> Featuring uniquely layered digital effects and hand-cutout images edited in a staccato pace that reflects the violence and brutality of the subject matter, \"Free Society\" went on to win numerous awards, was [[#Exhibitions, Reviews, Publications|featured in video and film festivals around the world]], and is in the permanent collection of the U.S. [[Library of Congress]].<ref>{{Citation| last=Rosenblatt | first=Stephen| title=Notice for Mandatory Deposit of Motion Pictures: Free Society: Man With A Video Camera| series =Library of Congress| place =Washington D.C., U.S. | date =4 December 1992 }}</ref> It also contains footage from his 1988 video<ref name=\"TSPRiot\" /> of the [[#Tompkins Square Park Riot|Tompkins Square Park Police Riot]].

===Fashion Video===

Between the years 1984 to 1997, Garrin was among the pioneers in the field of fashion videography.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Michael Nash, Kim Harlan Tassie |year=1991 |title=Art of music video : ten years after |medium=Video, Videocassette, U-matic, Visual material |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/art-of-music-video-ten-years-after/oclc/863740148&referer=brief_results |accessdate=24 March 2014 |location=California, U.S. |publisher=Long Beach Museum of Art Video Archive, circa 1970–2000.}}</ref> He worked with a number of popular fashion designers of the day. Highly attuned to the arts, they hired Garrin because of his background in [[fine arts]], his [[#Video & Media Artworks|experimental video works]] and [[#Paul Garrin and Nam June Paik|collaborations with video artist]] [[Nam June Paik]].

Some of his fashion videos are in the collection of the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]].

===Interactive Installations===

Since 1989, Garrin has been working with interactive media, and developed three highly acclaimed works, \"Yuppie Ghetto with Watchdog\",<ref name=\"MGever\" /> 1989–90, \"White Devil\", 1992-93 and \"Border Patrol\" 1995–97, all of which were produced with the technical collaboration of friend and artist [[David Rokeby]],<ref name=\"DRokeby\" >{{cite web |last=Rokeby|first=David |title =Border Patrol (collaboration with Paul Garrin) (1995)  |url=http://www.davidrokeby.com/border_patrol.html |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>

==Paul Garrin and Nam June Paik==

Starting as his assistant in 1981,<ref name=\"zkmprizebook\" /><ref name=\"lyon\" />{{rp|219}} Garrin eventually emerged as one of Nam June Paik's most important and longtime collaborators, working closely with him from 1982 to 1966.<ref name=\"E&E\" /> Evident in Paik's later pieces, Garrin produced hundreds of works with his richly layered and textured tour-de-force imaging techniques, where images multiply and divide within the frame; temporal and spatial shifts proliferate, visuals and sound are juxtaposed in ironic contexts.<ref name=\"eai\" />

These were exhibited and remain in the collections of major museums worldwide including the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMa),<ref name=\"moma\">{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title =Nam June Paik (American, born Korea. 1932–2006) with Paul Garrin, Betsy Connors.

One such collaboration was Garrin and Paik's ''Two Channel Music Tape Spring/Fall (1986)'' comprising two different but complementary videos playing simultaneously on monitors. The visual interplay creates a rapid visual assault. Scenes are multi-layered, fleeting and hard to register. Aesthetically pleasing and amusing footage of the news, pop-culture, and art world are altered and synthesized with the pair's signature image-processing techniques. This piece was acquired by the Long Beach Museum of Art (LBMA) by museum curator Michael Nash in 1989.<ref name=\"E&E\" />

===Tompkins Square Park Riot===

As an early [[citizen journalist]], Garrin's noted video document<ref name=\"TSPRiot\">{{cite AV media|people =Garrin, Paul (Artist, Documentarist)|title =[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bunhcwSvil8&index=15&list=PL34A7380938AB79D4] |medium =Video |publisher =Garrin, Paul |location =New York City |year =1988}}</ref> of the [[Tompkins Square Park Riot]] (1998) became iconic in exposing the coverup of police misconduct.<ref name=\"RDMcFadden\">{{cite news|last=McFadden |first=Robert D. |title=Park Curfew Protest Erupts Into a Battle And 38 Are Injured  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/nyregion/park-curfew-protest-erupts-into-a-battle-and-38-are-injured.html?src=pm&pagewanted=1 |accessdate=21 March 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 April 1988}}</ref> Shot with a home video camcorder, the tape exposed through the media the willful police violence against demonstrators and bystanders,<ref name=\"Shadow\">{{cite web |last=Flash |first=Chris |title = Tompkin Square Riot Memories |url=http://www.tacticalmediafiles.net/article.jsp;jsessionid=83A77DA12BC5F865A24C6CD5011FED5A?objectnumber=51821 |accessdate = 21 March 2014}}</ref> and became known as the spark which ignited the \"camcorder revolution\".<ref>{{cite interview |last=Garrin |first=Paul |subjectlink=Paul Garrin |interviewer=Chris Flash |title=The 1988 Tompkins Square Police Riot – A Video Point of View |url=http://www.tacticalmediafiles.net/article.jsp?objectnumber=51858 |publisher =The Shadow |location=New York City |date=2008|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>

Garrin, who was taking video pictures from atop a van was clubbed by two police officers (with other officers looking on) as he pleaded that he was climbing off the vehicle at their instruction and urged not to be hit.<ref name=\"nyclu\">{{cite journal |last1 =Gevirtz |first1 =Leslie |title =Report: Police Abuse: The Need for Civilian Investigation and Oversight |journal =NYCLU |publisher =New York Civil Liberties Union |location =New York City |date =June 1990 |url =http://www.nyclu.org/publications/report-police-abuse-need-civilian-investigation-and-oversight-1990}}</ref>{{rp|2}} With his potentially incriminating video shown on many television stations, Garrin was one of the most prominent of the Tompkins Square victims. On the day after the riot, he received two anonymous threatening phone calls, and the day after that another two. He recalls the language in some of them: \"You better get the fuck away -- they're gonna get you.\" \"Paul, you stupid motherfucker, you got the whole Police Department against you.\" \"You can run, but you can't hide.\"<ref name=\"nyclu\" />{{rp|A-7}}

From the fall of 2011, Garrin participated in the Friends of Cooper Union and Free Cooper Union brainstorming events, and contributed to \"The Way Forward\"<ref name=\"cues\">{{cite journal |last=Friends of Cooper Union |title =The Way Forward|publisher =Friends of Cooper Union |location =New York City |date =26 April 2012 |url =http://friendsofcooperunion.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CooperUnion_TheWayForward.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|17}} – a document of proposals to help restructure the Cooper Union to aid it out of the [[Cooper Union financial crisis and tuition protests]], and restore full tuition scholarships to all of its students.

In 2013, Garrin co-organized a CUAA/CUES event in the Great Hall in conjunction with the MIT Enterprise Forum of NY on surveillance. Entitled \"Ethics, Law & Surveillance Culture\" the program featured author [[James Bamford]], criminal defense attorney Stanley L.

==From Media Artist to Internet Social Entrepreneur==

In 1992, Garrin was a UNESCO Fellow at the [[Academy of Media Arts Cologne]], Germany, where he was first introduced to the Internet.

===Name.Space===

Formerly PG Media, Garrin founded Name.Space in 1996, an independent [[top-level domain]] ([[TLD]]) [[Domain name registry|registry]] with a primary mission to develop, publish and provide registry services for new TLDs on the Internet, to introduce competition, diversity and localism in the [[domain name]] market, and support the balanced interests of commercial, non-commercial, and political speech on the internet.<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=Name.Space Comments on ICANN RFP for Sponsored Top Level Domain Applications |author=Paul Garrin |date=25 August 2003 |website=http://forum.icann.org |url=http://forum.icann.org/mtg-cmts/stld-rfp-comments/general/msg00058.html |accessdate=December 5, 2014}}</ref>

Through online crowd-sourcing, Name.Space was the first to create hundreds of new Internet TLDs<ref name=\"LAndersonapr12\" /><ref name=\"LAnderson\" /> including .NYC,.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patterson |first=Clayton |title='Net pioneer needs help in fight for rights to .nyc |url=http://thevillager.com/2012/05/17/net-pioneer-needs-help-in-fight-for-rights-to-nyc/ |accessdate=21 March 2014 |newspaper=[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]]|date=17 May 2012}}</ref> ART, .MUSIC,.SPACE, .SUCKS and .GREEN,<ref name=\"KMurphy\">{{cite news |last =Murphy |first =Kevin |title =Company claims ownership of 482 new gTLDs |newspaper =Domain Incite |location =London, U.K. |date =22 March 2012 |url =http://domainincite.com/8247-company-claims-ownership-of-482-new-gtlds |accessdate =24 March 2014 }}</ref> pioneering the expansion<ref name=\"DRushkoff\">{{cite web| last =Rushkoff| first =David| authorlink=| title =YOUR.NAME.HERE.

==Early life and education==

Garrin grew up in [[Pennsauken, New Jersey]], in what he describes as a 50's cheap housing boom neighborhood, like something out of an archetypal twilight zone landscape. His understanding of hard times has its roots in childhood experience, when it became necessary for his family to seek [[public assistance]] due to his father's joblessness. A registered nurse, his mother got his family through hard times. Surrounded by a conformist mindset that seemed to care for little beyond sports, Garrin studied art as a way out. He took night classes at the [[Philadelphia College of Art]], and worked at an [[offset printing]] shop in the day to support himself.<ref name=\"MWilson\">{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Marcia |title=Video Artist Paul Garrin |newspaper=Downtown Express|date=6 February 1991}}</ref>

Garrin began working with [[video]] while studying [[fine arts]] at the [[Cooper Union]] for the Advancement of Science and Art in [[New York City]] (1977–82) where he enrolled after two years of classical art training in painting, drawing, sculpture, materials, and printmaking at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia (1977). At Cooper Union, Garrin studied with many well-known artists including [[Hans Haacke]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Robert Breer]] and [[Martha Rosler]], all of whom had a major impact on Garrin's aesthetics and critical social content in his works.<ref name=\"MWilson\" /><ref name=\"BAdams\">{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Brooks |date= 29 September 1998 |title=More than just High-Tech Video |newspaper=Hayward Gallery |location=South Bank Centre London}}</ref><ref name=\"lyon\">{{cite journal |author1=Richard Crevier |author2=John Doherty |author3=Bernard Eisenchitz |author4=Brian Holmes |author5=Laurent Muhleism |author6=Marie-Noelle Ryan |title =3e biennale de lyon d'art contemporian (installation, cinema, video, informatique) |journal =3e Biennale de Lyo |pages =22,216–219,268,442–443,522}}</ref>{{rp|219}}

==Video & Media Artworks==

===Art Videotapes===
Garrin belongs to the second generation of [[video artists]] whose works mix technological innovation with social criticism.<ref name=\"MGever\" /><ref name=\"lyon\" />{{rp|219}} Along with [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Julia Scher]], [[Lowell Darling]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Nayland Blake]] and [[Douglas Davis (artist)|Douglas Davis]], Garrin was among a promising group of autonomous artists creating far-ranging works of art within the Web, tapping into the potential of the Web as a creative medium, thereby transcending the basic nature of the medium at the time.<ref name=\"MDrier\" /><ref name=\"lyon\" />{{rp|422}}

From the time he was a student at Cooper Union, Paul's video works focused on single and double channel pieces. After graduation, Garrin's work was heavily influenced by the experimental works of [[Nam June Paik]]. This influence is seen emerging in such works as \"A Place to Hide\", 1985, and a series of pieces in collaboration with musician and composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and video artist [[Kit Fitzgerald]] sponsored by [[SONY]] Corporation, 1985–86, most notably \"A Human Tube\".<ref name=\"BAdams\" /><ref name=\"aplacetohide\">{{cite AV media| people = Garrin, Paul (Artist,Director)| title =A Place to Hide [http://replace.tv/index.php?option=com_seyret&task=videodirectlink&id=2]| medium = Art Videotape| publisher = replace.TV| location = New York City| date = 8 September 2008 }}</ref>

Some of his fashion videos are in the collection of the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]].

===Interactive Installations===

Since 1989, Garrin has been working with interactive media, and developed three highly acclaimed works, \"Yuppie Ghetto with Watchdog\",<ref name=\"MGever\" /> 1989–90, \"White Devil\", 1992-93 and \"Border Patrol\" 1995-97, all of which were produced with the technical collaboration of friend and artist [[David Rokeby]],<ref name=\"DRokeby\" >{{cite web |last=Rokeby|first=David |title =Border Patrol (collaboration with Paul Garrin) (1995)  |url=http://www.davidrokeby.com/border_patrol.html |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>

==Paul Garrin and Nam June Paik==

Starting as his assistant in 1981,<ref name=\"zkmprizebook\" /><ref name=\"lyon\" />{{rp|219}} Garrin eventually emerged as one of Nam June Paik's most important and longtime collaborators, working closely with him from 1982 to 1966.<ref name=\"E&E\" /> Evident in Paik's later pieces, Garrin produced hundreds of works with his richly layered and textured tour-de-force imaging techniques, where images multiply and divide within the frame; temporal and spatial shifts proliferate, visuals and sound are juxtaposed in ironic contexts.<ref name=\"eai\" />

These were exhibited and remain in the collections of major museums worldwide including the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMa),<ref name=\"moma\">{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title =Nam June Paik (American, born Korea. 1932–2006) with Paul Garrin, Betsy Connors.

One such collaboration was Garrin and Paik's ''Two Channel Music Tape Spring/Fall (1986)'' comprising two different but complementary videos playing simultaneously on monitors. The visual interplay creates a rapid visual assault. Scenes are multi-layered, fleeting and hard to register. Aesthetically pleasing and amusing footage of the news, pop-culture, and art world are altered and synthesized with the pair's signature image-processing techniques. This piece was acquired by the Long Beach Museum of Art (LBMA) by museum curator Michael Nash in 1989.<ref name=\"E&E\" />

===Tompkins Square Park Riot===

As an early [[citizen journalist]], Garrin's noted video document<ref name=\"TSPRiot\">{{cite AV media|people =Garrin, Paul (Artist, Documentarist)|title =[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bunhcwSvil8&index=15&list=PL34A7380938AB79D4] |medium =Video |publisher =Garrin, Paul |location =New York City |year =1988}}</ref> of the [[Tompkins Square Park Riot]] (1998) became iconic in exposing the coverup of police misconduct.<ref name=\"RDMcFadden\">{{cite news|last=McFadden |first=Robert D. |title=Park Curfew Protest Erupts Into a Battle And 38 Are Injured  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/nyregion/park-curfew-protest-erupts-into-a-battle-and-38-are-injured.html?src=pm&pagewanted=1 |accessdate=21 March 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 April 1988}}</ref> Shot with a home video camcorder, the tape exposed through the media the willful police violence against demonstrators and bystanders,<ref name=\"Shadow\">{{cite web |last=Flash |first=Chris |title = Tompkin Square Riot Memories |url=http://www.tacticalmediafiles.net/article.jsp;jsessionid=83A77DA12BC5F865A24C6CD5011FED5A?objectnumber=51821 |accessdate = 21 March 2014}}</ref> and became known as the spark which ignited the \"camcorder revolution\".<ref>{{cite interview |last=Garrin |first=Paul |subjectlink=Paul Garrin |interviewer=Chris Flash |title=The 1988 Tompkins Square Police Riot - A Video Point of View |url=http://www.tacticalmediafiles.net/article.jsp?objectnumber=51858 |publisher =The Shadow |location=New York City |date=2008|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref>

Garrin, who was taking video pictures from atop a van was clubbed by two police officers (with other officers looking on) as he pleaded that he was climbing off the vehicle at their instruction and urged not to be hit.<ref name=\"nyclu\">{{cite journal |last1 =Gevirtz |first1 =Leslie |title =Report: Police Abuse: The Need for Civilian Investigation and Oversight |journal =NYCLU |publisher =New York Civil Liberties Union |location =New York City |date =June 1990 |url =http://www.nyclu.org/publications/report-police-abuse-need-civilian-investigation-and-oversight-1990}}</ref>{{rp|2}} With his potentially incriminating video shown on many television stations, Garrin was one of the most prominent of the Tompkins Square victims. On the day after the riot, he received two anonymous threatening phone calls, and the day after that another two. He recalls the language in some of them: \"You better get the fuck away -- they're gonna get you.\" \"Paul, you stupid motherfucker, you got the whole Police Department against you.\" \"You can run, but you can't hide.\"<ref name=\"nyclu\" />{{rp|A-7}}

From the fall of 2011, Garrin participated in the Friends of Cooper Union and Free Cooper Union brainstorming events, and contributed to \"The Way Forward\"<ref name=\"cues\">{{cite journal |last=Friends of Cooper Union |title =The Way Forward|publisher =Friends of Cooper Union |location =New York City |date =26 April 2012 |url =http://friendsofcooperunion.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CooperUnion_TheWayForward.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|17}} – a document of proposals to help restructure the Cooper Union to aid it out of the [[Cooper Union financial crisis and tuition protests]], and restore full tuition scholarships to all of its students.

In 2013, Garrin co-organized a CUAA/CUES event in the Great Hall in conjunction with the MIT Enterprise Forum of NY on surveillance. Entitled \"Ethics, Law & Surveillance Culture\" the program featured author [[James Bamford]], criminal defense attorney Stanley L.

==From Media Artist to Internet Social Entrepreneur==

In 1992, Garrin was a UNESCO Fellow at the [[Academy of Media Arts Cologne]], Germany, where he was first introduced to the Internet.

===Name.Space===

Formerly PG Media, Garrin founded Name.Space in 1996, an independent [[top-level domain]] ([[TLD]]) [[Domain name registry|registry]] with a primary mission to develop, publish and provide registry services for new TLDs on the Internet, to introduce competition, diversity and localism in the [[domain name]] market, and support the balanced interests of commercial, non-commercial, and political speech on the internet.<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=Name.Space Comments on ICANN RFP for Sponsored Top Level Domain Applications |author=Paul Garrin |date=25 August 2003 |website=http://forum.icann.org |url=http://forum.icann.org/mtg-cmts/stld-rfp-comments/general/msg00058.html |accessdate=December 5, 2014}}</ref>

Through online crowd-sourcing, Name.Space was the first to create hundreds of new Internet TLDs<ref name=\"LAndersonapr12\" /><ref name=\"LAnderson\" /> including .NYC,.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patterson |first=Clayton |title='Net pioneer needs help in fight for rights to .nyc |url=http://thevillager.com/2012/05/17/net-pioneer-needs-help-in-fight-for-rights-to-nyc/ |accessdate=21 March 2014 |newspaper=[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]]|date=17 May 2012}}</ref> ART, .MUSIC,.SPACE, .SUCKS and .GREEN,<ref name=\"KMurphy\">{{cite news |last =Murphy |first =Kevin |title =Company claims ownership of 482 new gTLDs |newspaper =Domain Incite |location =London, U.K. |date =22 March 2012 |url =http://domainincite.com/8247-company-claims-ownership-of-482-new-gtlds |accessdate =24 March 2014 }}</ref> pioneering the expansion<ref name=\"DRushkoff\">{{cite web| last =Rushkoff| first =David| authorlink=| title =YOUR.NAME.HERE.

===Founding===
[[File:Bank of England Charter sealing 1694.jpg|thumb|left|''Sealing of the Bank of England Charter (1694)'', by Lady Jane Lindsay, 1905]]

[[Kingdom of England|England]]'s crushing defeat by [[Kingdom of France|France]], the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Battle of Beachy Head]], became the catalyst for England rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} No public funds were available, and the credit of [[William III of England|William III]]'s government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the £1,200,000 (at 8% per annum) that the government wanted.

To induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The Bank was given exclusive possession of the government's balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank notes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bagehot |first=Walter |title=Lombard Street : a description of the money market |year=1873 |publisher=Henry S. King and Co. |location=London |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4359}}</ref> The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The £1.2 million was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the navy.

As a side effect, the huge industrial effort needed, including establishing [[ironworks]] to make more nails and advances{{clarify|date=February 2016}} in agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the navy, started to transform the economy. This helped the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] – [[Acts of Union 1707|England and Scotland were formally united in 1707]] – to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jqDMmWhPHA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191220124600/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jqDMmWhPHA&gl=US&hl=en&has_verified=1&bpctr=9999999999 |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 December 2019 |title=BBC: Empire of the Seas programme |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010 }}</ref>

The establishment of the bank was devised{{clarify|date=February 2016}} by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]], in 1694. The plan of 1691, which had been proposed by [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]] three years before, had not then been acted upon.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EkUTaZofJYEC&dq=British+Parliamentary+reports+on+international+finance&printsec=frontcover#PPA25,M1 |title=Committee of Finance and Industry 1931 (Macmillan Report) description of the founding of Bank of England |date= 1 January 1979 |accessdate=10 May 2010 |isbn=9780405112126}} \"Its foundation in 1694 arose out the difficulties of the Government of the day in securing subscriptions to State loans. Its primary purpose was to raise and lend money to the State and in consideration of this service it received under its Charter and various Act of Parliament, certain privileges of issuing bank notes. The corporation commenced, with an assured life of twelve years after which the Government had the right to annul its Charter on giving one year's notice. '&#39;'Subsequent extensions of this period coincided generally with the grant of additional loans to the State'&#39;'\"</ref> 58 years earlier, in 1636, Financier to the king, [[Philip Burlamachi]], had proposed exactly the same idea in a letter addressed to [[Sir Francis Windebank]].<ref>Calendar Of State Papers Domestic Series p. 73 1636-1637</ref> He proposed a loan of £1.2 million to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as '''The Governor and Company of the Bank of England''' with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes. The [[royal charter]] was granted on 27 July through the passage of the [[Tonnage Act 1694]].<ref>H. Roseveare, /The Financial Revolution 1660–1760/ (1991, Longman), pp. 34</ref> Public finances were in such dire condition at the time<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EdwsCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=dire+condition+of+public+finance+1694#v=onepage&q=dire%20condition%20of%20public%20finance%201694&f=false |title=The Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution in World History |last=III |first=Kenneth E.

The first governor was Sir [[John Houblon]], who is depicted in the [[Bank of England £50 note|£50 note]] issued in 1994. The charter was renewed in 1742, 1764, and 1781.

[[File:The Old Lady of Threadneedle St.png|thumb|right|Satirical cartoon protesting against the introduction of paper money, by [[James Gillray]], 1797. The \"Old Lady of Threadneedle St\" (the Bank personified) is ravished by [[William Pitt the Younger]].]]

The Bank's original home was in Walbrook, a street in the City of London, where during reconstruction in 1954 archaeologists found the remains of a Roman [[Temple of Mithras, London|temple of Mithras]] (Mithras is&nbsp;– rather fittingly&nbsp;– said to have been worshipped as, amongst other things, the God of Contracts);<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithra-i|title=MITHRA i.

The Bank moved to its current location in Threadneedle Street in 1734,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bank of England: Buildings and Architects|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Pages/history/buildings.aspx#|publisher=The Bank of England|accessdate=31 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910182914/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Pages/history/buildings.aspx|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and thereafter slowly acquired neighbouring land to create the site necessary for erecting the Bank's original home at this location, under the direction of its chief architect Sir [[John Soane]], between 1790 and 1827. (Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s rebuilding of the Bank in the first half of the 20th century, demolishing most of Soane's masterpiece, was described by architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as \"the greatest architectural crime, in the [[City of London]], of the twentieth century\".)

When the idea and reality of the [[United Kingdom national debt|national debt]] came about during the 18th century, this was also managed by the Bank. During the [[American war of independence]], business for the Bank was so good that [[George Washington]] remained a shareholder throughout the period.<ref name=\"veconomist\" >{{cite news|author=|title=The many, often competing, jobs of the Bank of England|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21728876-new-book-shows-how-hard-it-central-bankers-please-all-masters-many-often|work=[[The Economist]]|date=16 September 2017}}</ref> By the [[charter]] renewal in 1781 it was also the bankers' bank&nbsp;– keeping enough gold to pay its notes on demand until 26 February 1797 when [[French Revolution|war]] had so diminished [[gold reserves]] that – following an invasion scare caused by the [[Battle of Fishguard]] days earlier – the government prohibited the Bank from paying out in gold by the passing of the [[Bank Restriction Act 1797]]. This prohibition lasted until 1821.

[[File:Bank of England (15479206598).jpg|thumb|Bank of England (15479206598)]]
The 1844 [[Bank Charter Act]] tied the issue of notes to the gold reserves and gave the Bank sole rights with regard to the issue of banknotes. Private banks that had previously had that right retained it, provided that their headquarters were outside London and that they deposited security against the notes that they issued. A few English banks continued to issue their own notes until the last of them was taken over in the 1930s. Scottish and Northern Irish private banks still have that right.

The bank acted as [[lender of last resort]] for the first time in the [[panic of 1866]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.voxeu.org/article/lender-last-resort-global-currency-sterling-lessons-dollar| title= From lender of last resort to global currency? Sterling lessons for the US dollar| publisher=VOX| date=23 July 2011| accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>

The last private bank in England to issue its own notes was Thomas Fox's [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] bank in [[Wellington, Somerset|Wellington]], which rapidly expanded, until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927. They were legal tender until 1964. There are nine notes left in circulation; one is housed at [[Tone Dale House]] Wellington.

Britain was on the [[gold standard]] until 1931, when the Bank of England unilaterally and abruptly took Britain off the gold standard.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=James Ashley|date=2016|title=Shocking Intellectual Austerity: The Role of Ideas in the Demise of the Gold Standard in Britain|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=70|issue=1|pages=175–207|doi=10.1017/S0020818315000314|issn=0020-8183}}</ref>

During the governorship of [[Montagu Norman]], from 1920 to 1944, the Bank made deliberate efforts to move away from [[commercial bank]]ing and become a central bank. In 1946, shortly after the end of Norman's tenure, [[Bank of England Act 1946|the bank was nationalised]] by the Labour government.

The Bank pursued the multiple goals of Keynesian economics after 1945, especially \"easy money\" and low interest rates to support aggregate demand.

In 1977, the Bank set up a wholly owned subsidiary called [[Bank of England Nominees|Bank of England Nominees Limited]] (BOEN), a private limited company, with two of its hundred £1 shares issued. According to its Memorandum & Articles of Association, its objectives are: \"To act as Nominee or agent or attorney either solely or jointly with others, for any person or persons, partnership, company, corporation, government, state, organisation, sovereign, province, authority, or public body, or any group or association of them....\" Bank of England Nominees Limited was granted an exemption by [[Edmund Dell]], Secretary of State for Trade, from the disclosure requirements under Section 27(9) of the Companies Act 1976, because \"it was considered undesirable that the disclosure requirements should apply to certain categories of shareholders.\" The Bank of England is also protected by its [[royal charter]] status, and the [[Official Secrets Act]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://moneyweek.com/27-july-1694-the-bank-of-england-is-created-by-royal-charter/|title=27 July 1694: the Bank of England is created by Royal Charter |date=2015-07-27|work=MoneyWeek|access-date=2018-01-02 |language=en-GB}}</ref> BOEN is a vehicle for governments and heads of state to invest in UK companies (subject to approval from the Secretary of State), providing they undertake \"not to influence the affairs of the company\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Proceedings of the House of Commons, 21st April 1977 |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1977/apr/21/shareholdings-disclosure}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Guardian article on Queen's private wealth, 30th May 2002 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/30/jubilee.monarchy2 | location=London | work=The Guardian |date=30 May 2002}}</ref> BOEN is no longer exempt from company law disclosure requirements.<ref>{{cite web |title=Proceedings of the House of Lords, 26th April 2011 |url=http://services.parliament.uk/hansard/Lords/bydate/20110426/writtenanswers/part021.html}}</ref> Although a [[dormant company]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Bank of England Nominees Company Accounts |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/56089866/BANK-OF-ENGLAND-NOMINEES-LIMITED-Company-accounts-from-Level-Business}}</ref> dormancy does not preclude a company actively operating as a nominee shareholder.<ref>{{cite web |title=Example of a Dormant Nominee Company |url=http://www.pilling.com/Nominee-Service.htm |access-date=12 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051438/http://www.pilling.com/Nominee-Service.htm |archive-date=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> BOEN has two shareholders: the Bank of England, and the Secretary of the Bank of England.<ref>{{cite web |title=Freedom of Information Act response regarding Bank of England Nominees Limited |url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/28738/response/74019/attach/2/D.pdf}}</ref>

The [[reserve requirement]] for banks to hold a minimum fixed proportion of their deposits as reserves at the Bank of England was abolished in 1981: see [[reserve requirement#United Kingdom|reserve requirement]] for more details. The contemporary transition from Keynesian economics to Chicago economics was analysed by [[Nicholas Kaldor]] in ''The Scourge of Monetarism''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Scourge_of_Monetarism.html?id=cj6wAAAAIAAJ |title=The Scourge of Monetarism |publisher=Oxford University Press |date= 1 Jan 1982|accessdate=19 August 2016|isbn=9780198771876}}</ref>

On 6 May 1997, following the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] that brought a Labour government to power for the first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Gordon Brown]], that the Bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Sattler |first1 = Thomas |last2 = Brandt |first2 = Patrick T. |last3 = Freeman |first3 = John R. |title = Democratic accountability in open economies |journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] |volume = 5 |issue = 1 |pages = 71–97 |doi = 10.1561/100.00009031 |date = April 2010 |ref = harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.503.6174}}</ref> Under the terms of the Bank of England Act 1998 (which came into force on 1 June 1998), the Bank's [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]] (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Monetary Policy Dates Since 1990 |publisher=Bank of England |accessdate=20 September 2007 |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/history.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629143630/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/history.htm |archivedate=29 June 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> The target has changed to 2% since the [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the Treasury's inflation index.<ref>{{cite web |title=Remit of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England and the New Inflation Target |publisher=HM Treasury |accessdate=20 September 2007 |date=10 December 2003 |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pdf/chancellorletter031210.pdf| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926052337/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pdf/chancellorletter031210.pdf| archivedate= 26 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1%, the Governor has to write a letter to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] explaining why, and how he will remedy the situation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monetary Policy Framework|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/framework/framework.aspx|publisher=Bank of England|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref>

The success of [[inflation target]]ing in the United Kingdom has been attributed to the Bank's focus on transparency.<ref name=IMF01>{{cite web|title=Targeting Inflation: The United Kingdom in Retrospect|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000/targets/strach7.pdf|publisher=IMF|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> The Bank of England has been a leader in producing innovative ways of communicating information to the public, especially through its Inflation Report, which have been emulated by many other central banks.<ref name=NBER01>{{cite web|title=Inflation Targeting Has Been A Successful Monetary Policy Strategy|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/apr98/w6126.html|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]]|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref>

Independent central banks that adopt an inflation target are known as [[Milton Friedman|Friedmanite]] central banks. Inflation targets combined with central bank independence have been characterised as a \"starve the beast\" strategy creating a lack of money in the public sector. This change in Labour's politics was described by [[Robert Skidelsky|Skidelsky]] in ''The Return of the Master''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1610390032 |title=The Return of the Master  |publisher=Public Affairs |date= 2009|accessdate=19 August 2016|isbn=978-1610390033}}</ref> as a mistake and as an adoption of the [[Rational expectations|Rational Expectations Hypothesis]] as promulgated by [[Alan Walters|Walters]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Walters | first = A.A. | title = Consistent expectations, distributed lags and the quantity theory | journal = [[The Economic Journal]] | volume = 81 | issue = 322 | pages = 273–281 | doi = 10.2307/2230071 | jstor = 2230071 | date = June 1971 | ref = harv }}</ref>

The handing over of monetary policy to the Bank had been a key plank of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' economic policy since the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].<ref>Liberal Democrat election manifesto, 1992</ref> Conservative MP [[Nicholas Budgen]] had also proposed this as a [[private member's bill]] in 1996, but the bill failed as it had the support of neither the government nor the opposition.

===21st century===
[[Mark Carney]] assumed the post of [[Governor of the Bank of England]] on 1 July 2013. He succeeded [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]], who took over on 30 June 2003. Carney, a Canadian, will serve an initial five-year term rather than the typical eight.

===Monetary stability===
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2017}}<!--three consecutive paragraphs without citations-->
Note: It is important to note that \"monetary\" and \"financial\" are synonyms.

Stable prices and confidence in the currency are the two main criteria for monetary stability. Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base [[interest rate]], which is decided by the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]], and through its communications strategy, such as publishing [[yield curve]]s.<ref>Bank of England – Yield Curves by [[Internet Archive]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20110421034658/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/]</ref>

:Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and [[market intelligence]] functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations, both at home and abroad. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the [[lender of last resort]] by extending credit when no other institution will.
The Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:
* [[HM Treasury]], the Government department responsible for financial and economic policy; and
* Other central banks and international organisations, with the aim of improving the international financial system.
The 1997 [[memorandum of understanding]] describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between the HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority |accessdate=10 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203101708/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2010, the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the FSA back into the Bank. As of 2012, the current director for financial stability is [[Andy Haldane]].<ref name = \"OccupyCorrect\">{{cite news

The Bank acts as the government's banker, and it maintains the government's [[Consolidated Fund]] account. It also manages the country's [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.

The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of [[banknote]]s in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one for one with deposits at the Bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its banknote printing operations to [[De La Rue]] in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Sale of Bank Note Printing|accessdate=10 June 2006}}</ref>

Since 1998, the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new [[Debt Management Office]], which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds ([[gilt-edged security|gilt-edged securities]] or ''gilts'') from the Bank at the end of 2004.

The Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries. This responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998, but after the financial crises in 2008 new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank.

In 2011, the interim [[Financial Policy Committee]] (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the Bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.

To help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report,<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211185350/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ |date=11 February 2012 }}</ref> and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public. It currently maintains [[Bank of England Museum|a free museum]] and ran the [[Target Two Point Zero]] competition for A-level students, closing in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/index.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Bank of England: Education|accessdate=28 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070329072231/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/index.htm| archivedate= 29 March 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===Asset purchase facility {{anchor|APF|Asset purchase facility}}===
The Bank has operated, since January 2009, an Asset Purchase Facility (APF) to buy \"high-quality assets financed by the issue of Treasury bills and the [[UK Debt Management Office|DMO]]'s cash management operations\" and thereby improve liquidity in the credit markets.<ref name=\"APF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/apf/index.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Asset Purchase Facility|accessdate=12 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100726113941/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/apf/index.htm| archivedate= 26 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> It has, since March 2009, also provided the mechanism by which the Bank's policy of [[quantitative easing]] (QE) is achieved, under the auspices of the MPC. Along with the managing the £200&nbsp;billion of QE funds, the APF continues to operate its corporate facilities. Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).<ref name=\"APF\"/>

==Banknote issues==
{{Main|Bank of England note issues}}
The Bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were \"White Notes\", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in £1 and £2 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between £5 and £1000.

Until the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=£2 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies & Co|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104053/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] began the process of restricting note issue to the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] in 1921.<ref name=banknote-history>{{cite web|title=A brief history of banknotes|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/scottish_northernireland.htm|website=Bank of England website|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=fox-note>{{cite web|title=Fox, Fowler & Co. £5 note|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%C2%A35_not.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002040119/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%c2%a35_not.aspx|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]], regulated by the Bank.<ref name=scot-ni/>

At the start of the [[First World War]], the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914]] was passed, which granted temporary powers to [[HM Treasury]] for issuing banknotes to the values of £1 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the Bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of [[George V|King George V]] (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:

{{quotation|''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND – Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount – Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14)''.}}

Treasury notes were issued until 1928, when the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928]] returned note-issuing powers to the banks.<ref name=\"treasurynotes1\">

</ref> The Bank of England issued notes for ten [[shilling]]s and one pound for the first time on 22 November 1928.

During the Second World War the German [[Operation Bernhard]] attempted to counterfeit denominations between £5 and £50, producing 500,000 notes each month in 1943. The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above £5 to be removed from circulation.

In 2006, over £53&nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the Bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm|title=Record £53m stolen in depot raid|accessdate=14 September 2014|date=27 February 2006}}</ref>

===Court of Directors===
The Court of Directors is a unitary board that is responsible for setting the organisation's strategy and budget and taking key decisions on resourcing and appointments. It consists of five executive members from the Bank plus up to 9 non-executive members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown. The Chancellor selects the Chairman of the Court from among the non-executive members. The Court is required to meet at least 7 times a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/people/court-of-directors|title=Court of Directors|publisher= Bank of England|accessdate= 8 January 2018}}</ref>

The Governor serves for a period of eight years, the Deputy Governors for five years, and the non-executive members for up to four years.

The '''Bank of England''' is the [[central bank]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694 to act as the [[Kingdom of England|English Government]]'s banker, and still one of the bankers for the [[Government of the United Kingdom]], it is the [[List of oldest banks in continuous operation|world's eighth-oldest bank]]. It was privately owned by stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until it was nationalised in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1945/oct/29/bank-of-england-bill |title=House of Commons Debate 29th October 1945, Second Reading of the Bank of England Bill |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date= |accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/1998/q2/the-bank-of-england-act |title=Bank of England Act 1946 |date= |accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>

The Bank is one of eight banks authorised to issue [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes in the United Kingdom]], has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in [[England and Wales]] and regulates the issue of banknotes by commercial banks in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name=scot-ni>{{cite web|title=The Bank of England's Role in Regulating the Issue of Scottish and Northern Ireland Banknotes|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/scottish-and-northern-ireland-banknotes|website=Bank of England website|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref>

The Bank's [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] has a devolved responsibility for managing [[monetary policy]]. The Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee \"if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances\", but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980011_en_3#pt2-pb4-l1g19 |title=Act of Parliament gives devolved responsibility to the MPC with reserve powers for the Treasury |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> The Bank's [[Financial Policy Committee]] held its first meeting in June 2011 as a [[macroprudential regulation|macroprudential regulator]] to oversee regulation of the UK's financial sector.

The Bank's headquarters have been in London's main financial district, the [[City of London]], on [[Threadneedle Street]], since 1734.

==History==

===Founding===
[[File:Bank of England Charter sealing 1694.jpg|thumb|left|''Sealing of the Bank of England Charter (1694)'', by Lady Jane Lindsay, 1905]]

[[Kingdom of England|England]]'s crushing defeat by [[Kingdom of France|France]], the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Battle of Beachy Head]], became the catalyst for England rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} No public funds were available, and the credit of [[William III of England|William III]]'s government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the £1,200,000 (at 8% per annum) that the government wanted.

To induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The Bank was given exclusive possession of the government's balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank notes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bagehot |first=Walter |title=Lombard Street : a description of the money market |year=1873 |publisher=Henry S. King and Co. |location=London |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4359}}</ref> The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The £1.2 million was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the navy.

As a side effect, the huge industrial effort needed, including establishing [[ironworks]] to make more nails and advances{{clarify|date=February 2016}} in agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the navy, started to transform the economy. This helped the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] – [[Acts of Union 1707|England and Scotland were formally united in 1707]] – to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jqDMmWhPHA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191220124600/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jqDMmWhPHA&gl=US&hl=en&has_verified=1&bpctr=9999999999 |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 December 2019 |title=BBC: Empire of the Seas programme |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010 }}</ref>

The establishment of the bank was devised{{clarify|date=February 2016}} by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]], in 1694. The plan of 1691, which had been proposed by [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]] three years before, had not then been acted upon.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EkUTaZofJYEC&dq=British+Parliamentary+reports+on+international+finance&printsec=frontcover#PPA25,M1 |title=Committee of Finance and Industry 1931 (Macmillan Report) description of the founding of Bank of England |date= 1 January 1979 |accessdate=10 May 2010 |isbn=9780405112126}} \"Its foundation in 1694 arose out the difficulties of the Government of the day in securing subscriptions to State loans. Its primary purpose was to raise and lend money to the State and in consideration of this service it received under its Charter and various Act of Parliament, certain privileges of issuing bank notes. The corporation commenced, with an assured life of twelve years after which the Government had the right to annul its Charter on giving one year's notice. '&#39;'Subsequent extensions of this period coincided generally with the grant of additional loans to the State'&#39;'\"</ref> 58 years earlier, in 1636, Financier to the king, [[Philip Burlamachi]], had proposed exactly the same idea in a letter addressed to [[Sir Francis Windebank]].<ref>Calendar Of State Papers Domestic Series p. 73 1636-1637</ref> He proposed a loan of £1.2 million to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as '''The Governor and Company of the Bank of England''' with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes. The [[royal charter]] was granted on 27 July through the passage of the [[Tonnage Act 1694]].<ref>H. Roseveare, /The Financial Revolution 1660–1760/ (1991, Longman), pp. 34</ref> Public finances were in such dire condition at the time<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EdwsCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=dire+condition+of+public+finance+1694#v=onepage&q=dire%20condition%20of%20public%20finance%201694&f=false |title=The Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution in World History |last=III |first=Kenneth E. Hendrickson |date=2014-11-25 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9780810888883 |language=en}}</ref> that the terms of the loan were that it was to be serviced at a rate of 8% per annum, and there was also a service charge of £4,000 per annum for the management of the loan. The first governor was Sir [[John Houblon]], who is depicted in the [[Bank of England £50 note|£50 note]] issued in 1994. The charter was renewed in 1742, 1764, and 1781.

===18th century===
[[File:The Old Lady of Threadneedle St.png|thumb|right|Satirical cartoon protesting against the introduction of paper money, by [[James Gillray]], 1797. The \"Old Lady of Threadneedle St\" (the Bank personified) is ravished by [[William Pitt the Younger]].]]

The Bank's original home was in Walbrook, a street in the City of London, where during reconstruction in 1954 archaeologists found the remains of a Roman [[Temple of Mithras, London|temple of Mithras]] (Mithras is&nbsp;– rather fittingly&nbsp;– said to have been worshipped as, amongst other things, the God of Contracts);<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithra-i|title=MITHRA i. MITRA IN OLD INDIAN – Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-20}}</ref> the Mithraeum ruins are perhaps the most famous of all 20th-century Roman discoveries in the City of London and can be viewed by the public.

The Bank moved to its current location in Threadneedle Street in 1734,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bank of England: Buildings and Architects|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Pages/history/buildings.aspx#|publisher=The Bank of England|accessdate=31 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910182914/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Pages/history/buildings.aspx|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and thereafter slowly acquired neighbouring land to create the site necessary for erecting the Bank's original home at this location, under the direction of its chief architect Sir [[John Soane]], between 1790 and 1827. (Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s rebuilding of the Bank in the first half of the 20th century, demolishing most of Soane's masterpiece, was described by architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as \"the greatest architectural crime, in the [[City of London]], of the twentieth century\".)

When the idea and reality of the [[United Kingdom national debt|national debt]] came about during the 18th century, this was also managed by the Bank. During the [[American war of independence]], business for the Bank was so good that [[George Washington]] remained a shareholder throughout the period.<ref name=\"veconomist\" >{{cite news|author=|title=The many, often competing, jobs of the Bank of England|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21728876-new-book-shows-how-hard-it-central-bankers-please-all-masters-many-often|work=[[The Economist]]|date=16 September 2017}}</ref> By the [[charter]] renewal in 1781 it was also the bankers' bank&nbsp;– keeping enough gold to pay its notes on demand until 26 February 1797 when [[French Revolution|war]] had so diminished [[gold reserves]] that – following an invasion scare caused by the [[Battle of Fishguard]] days earlier – the government prohibited the Bank from paying out in gold by the passing of the [[Bank Restriction Act 1797]]. This prohibition lasted until 1821.

===19th century===
[[File:Bank of England 1876.JPG|thumb|Bank Stock of the Bank of England, issued 25. January 1876]]
[[File:Bank of England (15479206598).jpg|thumb|Bank of England (15479206598)]]
The 1844 [[Bank Charter Act]] tied the issue of notes to the gold reserves and gave the Bank sole rights with regard to the issue of banknotes. Private banks that had previously had that right retained it, provided that their headquarters were outside London and that they deposited security against the notes that they issued. A few English banks continued to issue their own notes until the last of them was taken over in the 1930s. Scottish and Northern Irish private banks still have that right.

The bank acted as [[lender of last resort]] for the first time in the [[panic of 1866]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.voxeu.org/article/lender-last-resort-global-currency-sterling-lessons-dollar| title= From lender of last resort to global currency? Sterling lessons for the US dollar| publisher=VOX| date=23 July 2011| accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>

The last private bank in England to issue its own notes was Thomas Fox's [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] bank in [[Wellington, Somerset|Wellington]], which rapidly expanded, until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927. They were legal tender until 1964. There are nine notes left in circulation; one is housed at [[Tone Dale House]] Wellington.

===20th century===

Britain was on the [[gold standard]] until 1931, when the Bank of England unilaterally and abruptly took Britain off the gold standard.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=James Ashley|date=2016|title=Shocking Intellectual Austerity: The Role of Ideas in the Demise of the Gold Standard in Britain|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=70|issue=1|pages=175–207|doi=10.1017/S0020818315000314|issn=0020-8183}}</ref>

During the governorship of [[Montagu Norman]], from 1920 to 1944, the Bank made deliberate efforts to move away from [[commercial bank]]ing and become a central bank. In 1946, shortly after the end of Norman's tenure, [[Bank of England Act 1946|the bank was nationalised]] by the Labour government.

The Bank pursued the multiple goals of Keynesian economics after 1945, especially \"easy money\" and low interest rates to support aggregate demand. It tried to keep a fixed exchange rate, and attempted to deal with inflation and sterling weakness by credit and exchange controls.<ref>John Fforde, ''The Role of the Bank of England, 1941–1958'' (1992)</ref>

In 1977, the Bank set up a wholly owned subsidiary called [[Bank of England Nominees|Bank of England Nominees Limited]] (BOEN), a private limited company, with two of its hundred £1 shares issued. According to its Memorandum & Articles of Association, its objectives are: \"To act as Nominee or agent or attorney either solely or jointly with others, for any person or persons, partnership, company, corporation, government, state, organisation, sovereign, province, authority, or public body, or any group or association of them....\" Bank of England Nominees Limited was granted an exemption by [[Edmund Dell]], Secretary of State for Trade, from the disclosure requirements under Section 27(9) of the Companies Act 1976, because \"it was considered undesirable that the disclosure requirements should apply to certain categories of shareholders.\" The Bank of England is also protected by its [[royal charter]] status, and the [[Official Secrets Act]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://moneyweek.com/27-july-1694-the-bank-of-england-is-created-by-royal-charter/|title=27 July 1694: the Bank of England is created by Royal Charter |date=2015-07-27|work=MoneyWeek|access-date=2018-01-02 |language=en-GB}}</ref> BOEN is a vehicle for governments and heads of state to invest in UK companies (subject to approval from the Secretary of State), providing they undertake \"not to influence the affairs of the company\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Proceedings of the House of Commons, 21st April 1977 |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1977/apr/21/shareholdings-disclosure}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Guardian article on Queen's private wealth, 30th May 2002 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/30/jubilee.monarchy2 | location=London | work=The Guardian |date=30 May 2002}}</ref> BOEN is no longer exempt from company law disclosure requirements.<ref>{{cite web |title=Proceedings of the House of Lords, 26th April 2011 |url=http://services.parliament.uk/hansard/Lords/bydate/20110426/writtenanswers/part021.html}}</ref> Although a [[dormant company]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Bank of England Nominees Company Accounts |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/56089866/BANK-OF-ENGLAND-NOMINEES-LIMITED-Company-accounts-from-Level-Business}}</ref> dormancy does not preclude a company actively operating as a nominee shareholder.<ref>{{cite web |title=Example of a Dormant Nominee Company |url=http://www.pilling.com/Nominee-Service.htm |access-date=12 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051438/http://www.pilling.com/Nominee-Service.htm |archive-date=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> BOEN has two shareholders: the Bank of England, and the Secretary of the Bank of England.<ref>{{cite web |title=Freedom of Information Act response regarding Bank of England Nominees Limited |url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/28738/response/74019/attach/2/D.pdf}}</ref>

The [[reserve requirement]] for banks to hold a minimum fixed proportion of their deposits as reserves at the Bank of England was abolished in 1981: see [[reserve requirement#United Kingdom|reserve requirement]] for more details. The contemporary transition from Keynesian economics to Chicago economics was analysed by [[Nicholas Kaldor]] in ''The Scourge of Monetarism''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Scourge_of_Monetarism.html?id=cj6wAAAAIAAJ |title=The Scourge of Monetarism |publisher=Oxford University Press |date= 1 Jan 1982|accessdate=19 August 2016|isbn=9780198771876}}</ref>

On 6 May 1997, following the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] that brought a Labour government to power for the first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Gordon Brown]], that the Bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Sattler |first1 = Thomas |last2 = Brandt |first2 = Patrick T. |last3 = Freeman |first3 = John R. |title = Democratic accountability in open economies |journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] |volume = 5 |issue = 1 |pages = 71–97 |doi = 10.1561/100.00009031 |date = April 2010 |ref = harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.503.6174}}</ref> Under the terms of the Bank of England Act 1998 (which came into force on 1 June 1998), the Bank's [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]] (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Monetary Policy Dates Since 1990 |publisher=Bank of England |accessdate=20 September 2007 |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/history.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629143630/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/history.htm |archivedate=29 June 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> The target has changed to 2% since the [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the Treasury's inflation index.<ref>{{cite web |title=Remit of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England and the New Inflation Target |publisher=HM Treasury |accessdate=20 September 2007 |date=10 December 2003 |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pdf/chancellorletter031210.pdf| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926052337/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pdf/chancellorletter031210.pdf| archivedate= 26 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1%, the Governor has to write a letter to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] explaining why, and how he will remedy the situation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monetary Policy Framework|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/framework/framework.aspx|publisher=Bank of England|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref>

The success of [[inflation target]]ing in the United Kingdom has been attributed to the Bank's focus on transparency.<ref name=IMF01>{{cite web|title=Targeting Inflation: The United Kingdom in Retrospect|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000/targets/strach7.pdf|publisher=IMF|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> The Bank of England has been a leader in producing innovative ways of communicating information to the public, especially through its Inflation Report, which have been emulated by many other central banks.<ref name=NBER01>{{cite web|title=Inflation Targeting Has Been A Successful Monetary Policy Strategy|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/apr98/w6126.html|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]]|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref>

Independent central banks that adopt an inflation target are known as [[Milton Friedman|Friedmanite]] central banks. Inflation targets combined with central bank independence have been characterised as a \"starve the beast\" strategy creating a lack of money in the public sector. This change in Labour's politics was described by [[Robert Skidelsky|Skidelsky]] in ''The Return of the Master''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1610390032 |title=The Return of the Master  |publisher=Public Affairs |date= 2009|accessdate=19 August 2016|isbn=978-1610390033}}</ref> as a mistake and as an adoption of the [[Rational expectations|Rational Expectations Hypothesis]] as promulgated by [[Alan Walters|Walters]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Walters | first = A.A. | title = Consistent expectations, distributed lags and the quantity theory | journal = [[The Economic Journal]] | volume = 81 | issue = 322 | pages = 273–281 | doi = 10.2307/2230071 | jstor = 2230071 | date = June 1971 | ref = harv }}</ref>

The handing over of monetary policy to the Bank had been a key plank of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' economic policy since the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].<ref>Liberal Democrat election manifesto, 1992</ref> Conservative MP [[Nicholas Budgen]] had also proposed this as a [[private member's bill]] in 1996, but the bill failed as it had the support of neither the government nor the opposition.

===21st century===
[[Mark Carney]] assumed the post of [[Governor of the Bank of England]] on 1 July 2013. He succeeded [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]], who took over on 30 June 2003. Carney, a Canadian, will serve an initial five-year term rather than the typical eight. He became the first Governor not to be a UK citizen, but has since been granted citizenship.<ref>{{cite news  | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20501990 | title=Mark Carney named new Bank of England governor | publisher=BBC | date=26 November 2012 | accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> At Government request, his term was extended to 2019, then again to 2020.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45482461 |title = Carney to stay at Bank of England until 2020|work = BBC News|date = 2018-09-11}}</ref> As of January 2014, the Bank also has four [[Deputy Governor of the Bank of England|Deputy Governors]].

===Monetary stability===
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2017}}<!--three consecutive paragraphs without citations-->
Note: It is important to note that \"monetary\" and \"financial\" are synonyms.

Stable prices and confidence in the currency are the two main criteria for monetary stability. Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base [[interest rate]], which is decided by the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]], and through its communications strategy, such as publishing [[yield curve]]s.<ref>Bank of England – Yield Curves by [[Internet Archive]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20110421034658/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/]</ref>

:Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and [[market intelligence]] functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations, both at home and abroad. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the [[lender of last resort]] by extending credit when no other institution will.
The Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:
* [[HM Treasury]], the Government department responsible for financial and economic policy; and
* Other central banks and international organisations, with the aim of improving the international financial system.
The 1997 [[memorandum of understanding]] describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between the HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority |accessdate=10 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203101708/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2010, the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the FSA back into the Bank. As of 2012, the current director for financial stability is [[Andy Haldane]].<ref name = \"OccupyCorrect\">{{cite news

The Bank acts as the government's banker, and it maintains the government's [[Consolidated Fund]] account. It also manages the country's [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.

The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of [[banknote]]s in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one for one with deposits at the Bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its banknote printing operations to [[De La Rue]] in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Sale of Bank Note Printing|accessdate=10 June 2006}}</ref>

Since 1998, the [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new [[Debt Management Office]], which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds ([[gilt-edged security|gilt-edged securities]] or ''gilts'') from the Bank at the end of 2004.

The Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries. This responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998, but after the financial crises in 2008 new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank.

In 2011, the interim [[Financial Policy Committee]] (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the Bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.

To help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report,<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211185350/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ |date=11 February 2012 }}</ref> and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public. It currently maintains [[Bank of England Museum|a free museum]] and ran the [[Target Two Point Zero]] competition for A-level students, closing in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/index.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Bank of England: Education|accessdate=28 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070329072231/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/index.htm| archivedate= 29 March 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===Asset purchase facility {{anchor|APF|Asset purchase facility}}===
The Bank has operated, since January 2009, an Asset Purchase Facility (APF) to buy \"high-quality assets financed by the issue of Treasury bills and the [[UK Debt Management Office|DMO]]'s cash management operations\" and thereby improve liquidity in the credit markets.<ref name=\"APF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/apf/index.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Asset Purchase Facility|accessdate=12 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100726113941/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/apf/index.htm| archivedate= 26 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> It has, since March 2009, also provided the mechanism by which the Bank's policy of [[quantitative easing]] (QE) is achieved, under the auspices of the MPC. Along with the managing the £200&nbsp;billion of QE funds, the APF continues to operate its corporate facilities. Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).<ref name=\"APF\"/>

==Banknote issues==
{{Main|Bank of England note issues}}
The Bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were \"White Notes\", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in £1 and £2 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between £5 and £1000.

Until the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=£2 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies & Co|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104053/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] began the process of restricting note issue to the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] in 1921.<ref name=banknote-history>{{cite web|title=A brief history of banknotes|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/scottish_northernireland.htm|website=Bank of England website|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=fox-note>{{cite web|title=Fox, Fowler & Co. £5 note|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%C2%A35_not.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002040119/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%c2%a35_not.aspx|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]], regulated by the Bank.<ref name=scot-ni/>

At the start of the [[First World War]], the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914]] was passed, which granted temporary powers to [[HM Treasury]] for issuing banknotes to the values of £1 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the Bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of [[George V|King George V]] (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:

{{quotation|''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND – Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount – Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14)''.}}

Treasury notes were issued until 1928, when the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928]] returned note-issuing powers to the banks.<ref name=\"treasurynotes1\">

</ref> The Bank of England issued notes for ten [[shilling]]s and one pound for the first time on 22 November 1928.

During the Second World War the German [[Operation Bernhard]] attempted to counterfeit denominations between £5 and £50, producing 500,000 notes each month in 1943. The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above £5 to be removed from circulation.

In 2006, over £53&nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the Bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm|title=Record £53m stolen in depot raid|accessdate=14 September 2014|date=27 February 2006}}</ref>

==Gold vault==
The bank is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom and around 30 other countries.

===Court of Directors===
The Court of Directors is a unitary board that is responsible for setting the organisation's strategy and budget and taking key decisions on resourcing and appointments. It consists of five executive members from the Bank plus up to 9 non-executive members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown. The Chancellor selects the Chairman of the Court from among one of the non-executive members. The Court is required to meet at least 7 times a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/people/court-of-directors|title=Court of Directors|publisher= Bank of England|accessdate= 8 January 2018}}</ref>

'''Marc Bolan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|l|ə|n}} {{respell|BOH|lən}}; born '''Mark Feld'''; 30 September 1947&nbsp;– 16 September 1977) was an English singer, songwriter, musician and poet. He was the lead singer of the band [[T. Rex (band)|T.

== Early life and career ==
[[File:Marc bolan plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque marking Marc Bolan's childhood home, 25 [[Stoke Newington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]. (November 2005)]]

Bolan was born at [[Hackney Hospital]] and grew up in Stoke Newington, in the borough of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], east London, the son of Phyllis Winifred (née Atkins) and Simeon Feld, a lorry driver. His father was an [[Ashkenazi Jew]] of Russian and Polish ancestry, while his mother was of [[English people|English]] descent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pauldunoyer.com/pages/journalism/journalism_item.asp?journalismID=289 |title=Paul Du Noyer on Marc Bolan of T.Rex |publisher=Pauldunoyer.com |accessdate=2 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314172846/http://www.pauldunoyer.com/pages/journalism/journalism_item.asp?journalismID=289 |archive-date=14 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Solid gold, easy action|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/solid-gold-easy-action-1245987.html|accessdate=6 April 2011 | location=London|work=The Independent|first=Tim|last=De Lisle|date=17 August 1997}}</ref> Moving to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], southwest London, he fell in love with the rock and roll of [[Gene Vincent]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Chuck Berry]] and hung around coffee bars such as [[The 2i's Coffee Bar|the 2i's]] in [[Soho]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

Bolan was a pupil at Northwold Primary School, Upper Clapton. He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show ''[[Orlando (TV series)|Orlando]]'', dressed as a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a [[skiffle]] band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops,\" a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old [[Helen Shapiro]]. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.<ref name=bramley>{{cite book|last=Bramley|first=John & Shan|title=Marc Bolan: The Legendary Years|year=1992|publisher=Smith Gryphon Publishers|location=London|isbn=1-85685-138-9|pages=13–14}}</ref>

Bolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows. ''Town'' magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. 

It is suggested that Bolan was in fact bisexual in his life according to those in the music scene. The Who's [[Pete Townshend]] stated in an interview; ''\"I remember Marc Bolan with full make-up on, working as a rent boy to buy clothes, in and around the Scene Club. He was about 15\".''<ref>{{cite website|publisher=Paul Du Noyer|url=https://www.pauldunoyer.com/pop-napoleon-marc-bolan-of-t-rex/|title=Marc Bolan of T. Rex}}</ref>

In 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero, [[Cliff Richard]], the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.

Bolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor [[Allan Warren]], who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear in [[boho-chic]], wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then current source of inspiration, [[Bob Dylan]]. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paytress|first=Mark|title=Bolan: The Rise and Fall of a 20th Century Superstar|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1-84609-147-0}}</ref> Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and [[Dion Di Mucci]]'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of [[Betty Everett]]'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.

Warren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for £200 to his landlord, property mogul [[David Kirch]], in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=The confessions of a society photographer|year=1976|publisher=Jupiter|location=London|isbn=978-0-904041-68-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=Dukes, Queens and Other Stories|year=1999|publisher=New Millennium Books|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Marc Bolan—The Early Years|url=http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|accessdate=6 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811221907/http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.

He signed to [[Decca Records]] in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from [[James Bolam]], a contraction of Bob Dylan, and - according to Bolan himself, that Decca Records chose the name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Marc Bolan: The Rise And Fall Of A 20th Century Superstar  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yk4U2LILeMC&pg=PT66#v=onepage&q&f=false  | pages=66–67  | author=Mark Paytress  |publisher= Omnibus Press| date= 5 Nov 2009  |isbn = 9780857120236}}</ref> He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with [[The Ladybirds]] on backing vocals (later finding fame with [[Benny Hill]]), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Big Jim Sullivan]], was produced by Jim Economides, with music director [[Mike Leander]]. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and [[Donovan]]. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In,\" written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary [[Fred Neil]], was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the [[beat poets]]. Neither song made the charts.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

In 1966, Bolan turned up at [[Simon Napier-Bell]]'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album ''The Beginning of Doves''). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death,\" was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album ''[[You Scare Me to Death]]''. Napier-Bell managed [[The Yardbirds]] and [[John's Children]] and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"[[Desdemona (Marc Bolan song)|Desdemona]]\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".

His tenure with the band was brief. When the band split following an ill-fated German gig with [[The Who]], Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (''The Krakenmist'' and ''Pictures Of Purple People'') as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth - he famously claimed to have spent time with a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that would appear on his first albums with [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

==Tyrannosaurus Rex==
When John's Children collapsed, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label Track Records. But Bolan, unperturbed, rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer [[Steve Peregrin Took]] and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"<ref name=\"TR1\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=T-Rex— Up Close And Personal|year=2007}}</ref> Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because [[Track Records|Track]] had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"<ref name=\"TR1\" />

The original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex released three albums and four singles, flirting with the charts, reaching as high as number fifteen. They were supported with airplay by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2JYRaGZ8JJIC&pg=PA122 “Stand and Deliver: The Autobiography”]. p. 122. Pan Macmillan, 2007</ref> One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free [[List of concerts in Hyde Park|Hyde Park concert]] in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled ''The Warlock of Love''. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969-70 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keatsian.co.uk/keats-and-bolan.htm|title=Bolan and Keats|publisher=Keatsian.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628225345/http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2013|title=Reprinted 'The Warlock of Love' by Marc Bolan|publisher=Connectedglobe.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>

In keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Stratocaster]] decorated with a [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] teardrop motif. After replacing Took with [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]], he let the electric influences come forward even further on ''[[A Beard of Stars]]'', the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song \"Elemental Child\", featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Bolan married his girlfriend, June Ellen Child, on 30 January 1970.<ref>{{cite news |title=My Daddy of Britpop by Marc Bolan's son |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/my-daddy-of-britpop-by-marc-bolans-son-6665946.html |accessdate=2 February 2020 |work=London Evening Standard}}</ref> She was a former secretary to the manager of another of his heroes, [[Syd Barrett]], and June was influential in raising her new husband's profile in the music industry.<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Becoming more adventurous musically, Marc bought a modified vintage [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar (featured on the cover of the album ''[[T. Rex (album)|T. Rex]]''), and then wrote and recorded his first hit \"[[Ride a White Swan]]\", which was dominated by a rolling hand-clapping back-beat, Bolan's electric guitar and Finn's percussion. At this time he also shortened the group's name to T. Rex.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

Bolan and his producer [[Tony Visconti]] oversaw the session for \"Ride a White Swan\", the single that changed Bolan's career which was inspired in part by [[Mungo Jerry]]'s success with \"[[In the Summertime (Mungo Jerry song)|In the Summertime]]\", moving Bolan away from predominantly acoustic numbers to a more electric sound.<ref name=VIS>Philip Auslander [https://books.google.com/books?id=BV6SnnkAU9IC&pg=PA84&dq=tony+visconti+t.rex&hl=en&ei=d-IETZSrNseZOouM6aYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=tony%20visconti%20t.rex&f=false Performing glam rock: gender and theatricality in popular music] University of Michigan Press, 2006</ref> Recorded on 1 July 1970 and released later that year, it made slow progress in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40]], until it finally peaked in early 1971 at number two.<ref name=\"UK Charts\">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/2746/t-rex/ |title=T.

Bolan took to wearing top hats and feather boas on stage as well as putting drops of glitter on each of his [[cheekbone]]s. Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this—some say it was introduced by his [[personal assistant]], Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then. Other performers—and their fans—soon took up variations on the idea. The era of [[glam rock|glam]] and glitter rock was born.<ref name=\"Bolan glam\"/>
[[File:Mark Bolan T-Rex (8716257007).jpg|thumb|upright|An outfit of Marc Bolan on display at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in Sydney, Australia]]
The glam era also saw the rise of Bolan's friend [[David Bowie]], whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie's 1970 single \"Prettiest Star\"; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which would continue throughout his career.

Bolan followed \"Ride a White Swan\" and ''T. Rex'' by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist [[Steve Currie]] and drummer [[Bill Legend]], and cutting a five-minute single, \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"[[Hey Jude]]\". It was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song was re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the United States, to avoid confusion with another song with the same title by the American band [[Chase (band)|Chase]]. The song reached No. 10 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in early 1972, the only top 40 single the band had in the US.<ref>Jeremy Simmonds [https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&pg=PA99&dq=get+it+on+t.rex&hl=en&ei=-t4ETejaFMyhOu6WyLIB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=get%20it%20on%20t.rex&f=false The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches (Marc Bolan)] Chicago Review Press, 2008</ref>

In November 1971, the band's record label, [[Fly Records|Fly]], released the ''[[Electric Warrior]]'' track \"[[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]]\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for [[EMI]], who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK. In 1972, Bolan achieved two more British number ones with \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Metal Guru]]\" (the latter of which stopped [[Elton John]] getting to the top with \"[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]\") and two more number twos in \"[[Children of the Revolution (song)|Children of the Revolution]]\" and \"[[Solid Gold Easy Action]]\".<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>

In the same year he appeared in [[Ringo Starr]]'s film ''[[Born to Boogie]]'', a documentary showing a concert at Wembley Empire Pool on 18 March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at [[John Lennon]]'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and Elton John on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>

In 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend [[Jeff Lynne]] on the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] songs \"[[Ma-Ma-Ma Belle]]\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from ''[[On the Third Day]]'', as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>

By late 1973, his pop star fame gradually began to wane, even though he achieved a number three hit, \"[[20th Century Boy]]\", in February and mid-year \"The Groover\" followed it to number four.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/> \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"[[Teenage Dream (Marc Bolan song)|Teenage Dream]]\" from the 1974 album ''Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow'' showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend Gloria Jones on keyboards as well as backing vocals.

Eventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Legend left in 1973 and Finn in 1975 and Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Gloria Jones. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums which, while not reaching major commercial success, were full of unusual lyrics and sometimes eccentric musical experiments. Bolan was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working, producing at least one album every year.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

== Resurgence ==
[[File:Gloria Jones with son Rolan Bolan 7972.jpg|thumb|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014]]
In September 1975 [[Gloria Jones]] gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from [[tax exile]] in the US and [[Monaco]] and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show ''Supersonic'', directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, but he never regained the success of his glory days of the early 1970s. The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album, ''Dandy in the Underworld'', and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

Later in 1977, [[Granada Television]] commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called ''[[Marc (TV series)|Marc]]'' in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former [[John's Children]]-bandmate [[Andy Ellison]], then fronting the band [[Radio Stars (band)|Radio Stars]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

Bolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival [[David Bowie]] was the final guest on the last episode of ''Marc''. The two performed Bowie's song [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]] near the end of the show, and after Bolan's signoff, they began to play a bluesy song over the closing credits. Right as the vocals were about to begin, however, Bolan stumbled off the stage and out of the camera frame. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxUAWIkiOg&list=RDkDxUAWIkiOg#t=78|title=Mark Bolan falls off stage on 'Marc' Show 6, 1977 via YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref>
The another musical guest of note for the final posthumous episode(#1.6 or episode 6) of Marc was Generation X.   Marc Bolan's quote about another artist (SNIFF!) \"Supposed To Be As Pretty As Me\" occurs during that episode while introducing Generation X and directly refers to their lead singer Billy Idol,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3863132/|title=Episode #1.6|website=IMDdb.com|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> who was still the lead singer of Generation X at the time.

On 16 September 1977, Bolan was riding in a [[Austin Mini#Mini Clubman and 1275GT: 1969–1980|Mini 1275GT]] driven by [[Gloria Jones]] as they headed home from Mortons club and restaurant in [[Berkeley Square]].

His funeral service was at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]], a secular provision in north London, where his ashes were buried. The car crash site has subsequently become a shrine to his memory, where fans leave tributes beside the tree. In 2013, the shrine was featured on the [[BBC Four]] series ''Pagans and Pilgrims: Britain's Holiest Places''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pagans and Pilgrims: Britain's Holiest Places|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rk2fp|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> The site, referred to as [[Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine]], is owned and maintained by the T.

Bolan never learned to drive, fearing a premature death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/e059d91d-1141-47e9-8c67-c779db4190b6|title=40 years on: 6 things you possibly didn't know about Marc Bolan|last=Hebblethwaite|first=Phil|date=15 September 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4728611/Behind-the-glitter.html|title=Behind the glitter|last=Brown|first=Mick|date=|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=}}</ref> Despite this fear, cars or automotive components are at least mentioned in, if not the subject of, many of his songs.

[[File:Bolan Bust.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine]] at the site where he died in a car crash in [[Barnes, London]], on what would have been his 60th birthday, 30 September 2007]]
Bolan was the early guitar idol of [[Johnny Marr]], who later found fame as the guitarist of the influential [[indie rock]] band [[the Smiths]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.johnny-marr.com/about| title=Johnny Marr biography| work=Official Johnny Marr website| access-date=19 October 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222021727/http://www.johnny-marr.com/about| archive-date=22 February 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1979, [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to the single \"[[The Staircase (Mystery)]]\". The band had played the song live for several years and on the first anniversary of Bolan's death in 1978 played the song as the encore when they performed at Aylesbury Friars.

In December 1980, \"Telegram Sam\" was the fourth single released by British gothic rock band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]. Also in 1980, [[the Bongos]] were the first American group, with \"Mambo Sun\", to enter the ''Billboard'' charts with a T.Rex cover. Since then, Bongos frontman [[Richard Barone]] has recorded several other Bolan compositions (\"The Visit,\" \"Ballrooms of Mars\"), worked with T.Rex producer [[Tony Visconti]] for his current solo album, ''Glow'' (2010, [[Bar/None Records]]) that includes a remake of Bolan's \"Girl\" from ''Electric Warrior'', and has himself produced tracks for Bolan's son Rolan.

In 1983, [[NWOBHM]] band [[Girlschool]] covered \"20th Century Boy\" on their [[Play Dirty (album)|Play Dirty]]. In 1984, [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as a B-side to the single \"[[I Will Dare]]\"; it is also included on the reissue version of their album ''[[Let It Be (The Replacements album)|Let It Be]]''.<ref>{{cite press release |title=The Replacements Remastered |url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=546 |publisher=Rhino Records |date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222093006/http://rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=546 |archivedate=22 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1985, [[Duran Duran]] splinter band [[Power Station (band)|Power Station]], with [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] as vocalist, took a version of \"Get It On\" into the UK Top 40 and to US No. 6, the first cover of a Bolan song to enter the charts since his death. They also performed the tune (with [[Michael Des Barres]] replacing Palmer) at the [[Live Aid]] concert. In 1986, [[Violent Femmes]] covered the song \"Children of the Revolution\" on their album, ''[[The Blind Leading the Naked]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first= Chris |last= Woodstra |title= Violent Femmes – The Blind Leading the Naked |publisher= AllMusic. All Media Network |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-blind-leading-the-naked-mw0000196219 |accessdate= 18 July 2013}}</ref> In 1989, [[X Japan|X]] released a live cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to their single \"[[Kurenai (song)|Kurenai]]\". In 1990, [[Baby Ford]] did a cover of \"Children of the Revolution\" that appeared on the album ''Oooh, The World of Baby For''. In 1991, [[T-Bolan]] a Japanese rock band debuted. The name of this band was inspired by T. Rex and its vocalist Marc Bolan.

In 1993, [[Guns N' Roses]] covered \"Buick MacKane\" on ''[[The Spaghetti Incident?]]'' but it was mislabelled on the album as \"Buick Makane\". Rock guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] has worn a t-shirt with an image of Bolan on the front.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]' 1994 hit song \"[[Cigarettes & Alcohol]]\" is acknowledged as drawing strongly upon \"Get It On\" in its instrumental music. In 1993, [[Adam Ant]] covered the track live on his ''[[Persuasion (Adam Ant album)|Persuasion]]'' tour.  The song was included on a private preview show on 21 February 1993 in Burbank, Los Angeles which was recorded and released, complete with the cover version, as a live bonus CD with 1994 pressings of his ''[[Antmusic: The Very Best of Adam Ant]]'' collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adam-ant.net/1993.html |title=1993 |website=Adam-ant.net |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adam-ant.net/antmusiccompdouble.html |title=Antmusic double CD |website=Adam-ant.net |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>

The Cameron Crowe-created movie ''[[Almost Famous]]'' features a scene where a Black Sabbath groupie is telling aspiring journalist William Miller (said to be created in Crowe's own image) about how, \"Marc Bolan broke her heart, man. It's famous,\" regarding the character of Penny Lane, played by [[Kate Hudson]].<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/style/la-ig-lookback10-2008aug10-story.html “T. Rex's Marc Bolan, always famous -- and flamboyant“]. ''Los Angeles Times''. Retrieved 3 February 2019</ref> In 2000, [[Naoki Urasawa]] created a Japanese [[manga]] entitled ''[[20th Century Boys]]'' that was inspired by Marc Bolan's song, \"[[20th Century Boy]]\". The series is a multiple award-winner, and has also been released in North America. The story was adopted into three successful live-action movies from 2008 to 2009, which were also released in the US, Canada and the UK.

In 2003, [[Depeche Mode]]'s [[Martin Gore]] recorded covers of \"Life Is Strange\" and \"Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys\", and included them as b-sides of the single \"Stardust\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.depmod.com/martingore/stardust/g480.htm |title=· Depeche Mode ·Stardust · CDMUTE296 |publisher=Depmod.com |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref> In 2006, [[Def Leppard]] released their album ''[[Yeah! (Def Leppard album)|Yeah!]]'', which contains covers of their favourite bands while growing up, the first song on this album is \"20th Century Boy\". Joe Elliott wanted to sing \"Metal Guru\" while Vivian Campbell wanted \"Telegram Sam\" but end up agreeing to \"20th Century Boy\". It's not the first time that Def Leppard has sung a T.Rex song; there is a live version of Get It On. \"Children of the Revolution\" was similarly performed by [[Elton John]] and [[Pete Doherty]] of [[The Libertines]] at [[Live 8]], 20 years later. [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] and [[Gavin Friday]] also covered \"Children of the Revolution\" on the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack.

\"20th Century Boy\" introduced a new generation of devotees to Bolan's work in 1991 when it was featured on a [[Levi Strauss|Levi]]'s jeans TV commercial featuring [[Brad Pitt]], and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. The song was performed by the fictional band The Flaming Creatures (performed by [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], reprised by Placebo and David Bowie at the 1999 [[BRIT Awards]]) in the 1998 film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]''. In every decade since his death, a Bolan greatest hits compilation has placed in the top 20 UK albums and periodic boosts in sales have come via cover versions from artists inspired by Bolan, including [[Morrissey]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. Similarly, \"I Love to Boogie\" was briefly used on an advert for Robinson's soft drink in 2001, bringing Bolan's music to a new generation. [[Mitsubishi]] also featured \"20th Century Boy\" in a 2002 car commercial, prompting Hip-O Records to release a best-of collection CD titled ''20th Century Boy: The Ultimate Collection''.

His music is still widely used in films, recent notable cases being ''[[Breakfast on Pluto]]'', ''[[Death Proof]]'', ''[[Lords of Dogtown]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'', ''Breaking-Up'', ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', ''[[School of Rock]]'' , ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]'' and ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Wonderland (2003)|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0335563/|accessdate=2016-11-30}}</ref> Bolan is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence ([[Joy Division]]/[[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] has said that the first single he owned was \"Ride a White Swan\".) However, he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music. The tunes were never as important as the words.

Bolan had arranged a discretionary [[trust law|trust]] to safeguard his money. A small, separate [[Jersey]]-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between £20 and £30&nbsp;million (approx $38&nbsp;– $57&nbsp;million), remains in trust. As of 2007, Bolan's family is supposed to have a house paid for by the trust, and Rolan is supposed to receive an allowance.

There are two plaques dedicated to his memory at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in [[North London]]. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on&nbsp;– his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.

In 2006, TV series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'', William Matheson portrays Marc Bolan, circa 1973, in a bar in [[Manchester]]. Time-travelling [[Sam Tyler]] recognises him, has a fan boy moment, and warns him to be careful of riding in Minis. In the [[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|American version of the series]], the character is replaced by that of [[Jim Croce]], who died later that year in a plane crash, and Sam warns him. However, the T. Rex version of \"Get It On\" is played in the New York dance club in that scene.

In 2007, the [[English Tourist Board]] included [[Bolan's Rock Shrine]] in their guide to Important Sites of Rock 'n Roll interest 'England Rocks'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/740087/Rockin-all-over-England.html|title=Rockin' all over England|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> As reported in 2011, a school is planned in his honour, to be built in Sierra Leone: The Marc Bolan School of Music and Film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/58393|title=Marc Bolan School of Music opens in Sierra Leone|date=2 August 2011|website=Nme.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> A musical, ''20th Century Boy'', based on Bolan's life, and featuring his music, premiered at the [[New Wolsey Theatre]] in [[Ipswich]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/southeast/E8831306252498/A+Show+About+Bolan+in+Ipswich.html |title=A Show About Bolan in Ipswich |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020124308/http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/southeast/E8831306252498/A+Show+About+Bolan+in+Ipswich.html |archive-date=20 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

'''Marc Bolan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|l|ə|n}} {{respell|BOH|lən}}; born '''Mark Feld'''; 30 September 1947&nbsp;– 16 September 1977) was an English singer, songwriter, musician and poet. He was the lead singer of the band [[T. Rex (band)|T.

== Early life and career ==
[[File:Marc bolan plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque marking Marc Bolan's childhood home, 25 [[Stoke Newington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]. (November 2005)]]

Bolan was born at [[Hackney Hospital]] and grew up in Stoke Newington, in the borough of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], east London, the son of Phyllis Winifred (née Atkins) and Simeon Feld, a lorry driver. His father was an [[Ashkenazi Jew]] of Russian and Polish ancestry, while his mother was of [[English people|English]] descent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pauldunoyer.com/pages/journalism/journalism_item.asp?journalismID=289 |title=Paul Du Noyer on Marc Bolan of T.Rex |publisher=Pauldunoyer.com |accessdate=2 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314172846/http://www.pauldunoyer.com/pages/journalism/journalism_item.asp?journalismID=289 |archive-date=14 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Solid gold, easy action|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/solid-gold-easy-action-1245987.html|accessdate=6 April 2011 | location=London|work=The Independent|first=Tim|last=De Lisle|date=17 August 1997}}</ref> Moving to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], southwest London, he fell in love with the rock and roll of [[Gene Vincent]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Chuck Berry]] and hung around coffee bars such as [[The 2i's Coffee Bar|the 2i's]] in [[Soho]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

Bolan was a pupil at Northwold Primary School, Upper Clapton. He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show ''[[Orlando (TV series)|Orlando]]'', dressed as a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a [[skiffle]] band. While at school, he played guitar in \"Susie and the Hula Hoops,\" a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old [[Helen Shapiro]]. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school for bad behaviour.<ref name=bramley>{{cite book|last=Bramley|first=John & Shan|title=Marc Bolan: The Legendary Years|year=1992|publisher=Smith Gryphon Publishers|location=London|isbn=1-85685-138-9|pages=13–14}}</ref>

Bolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows. ''Town'' magazine featured him as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread. 

It is suggested that Bolan was in fact bisexual in his life according to those in the music scene. The Who's [[Pete Townshend]] stated in an interview; ''\"I remember Marc Bolan with full make-up on, working as a rent boy to buy clothes, in and around the Scene Club. He was about 15\".''<ref>{{cite website|publisher=Paul Du Noyer|url=https://www.pauldunoyer.com/pop-napoleon-marc-bolan-of-t-rex/|title=Marc Bolan of T. Rex}}</ref>

In 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called \"All at Once\" (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero, [[Cliff Richard]], the \"English Elvis\"), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan's first professional recordings.

Bolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor [[Allan Warren]], who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan's potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren's floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear in [[boho-chic]], wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then current source of inspiration, [[Bob Dylan]]. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan \"left no impression\" on him at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paytress|first=Mark|title=Bolan: The Rise and Fall of a 20th Century Superstar|year=2006|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1-84609-147-0}}</ref> Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan's first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and [[Dion Di Mucci]]'s \"The Road I'm On (Gloria)\". A version of [[Betty Everett]]'s \"You're No Good\" (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.

Warren later sold Bolan's contract and recordings for £200 to his landlord, property mogul [[David Kirch]], in lieu of three months' back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan's mother pushed into Kirch's office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=The confessions of a society photographer|year=1976|publisher=Jupiter|location=London|isbn=978-0-904041-68-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Allan|title=Dukes, Queens and Other Stories|year=1999|publisher=New Millennium Books|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Marc Bolan—The Early Years|url=http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|accessdate=6 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811221907/http://members.cox.net/dregenold/marc/early.html|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan's known recordings.

He signed to [[Decca Records]] in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from [[James Bolam]], a contraction of Bob Dylan, and - according to Bolan himself, that Decca Records chose the name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Marc Bolan: The Rise And Fall Of A 20th Century Superstar  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yk4U2LILeMC&pg=PT66#v=onepage&q&f=false  | pages=66–67  | author=Mark Paytress  |publisher= Omnibus Press| date= 5 Nov 2009  |isbn = 9780857120236}}</ref> He recorded his debut single \"The Wizard\" with [[The Ladybirds]] on backing vocals (later finding fame with [[Benny Hill]]), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. \"The Wizard\", Bolan's first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Big Jim Sullivan]], was produced by Jim Economides, with music director [[Mike Leander]]. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (\"Reality\" and \"Song for a Soldier\") have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and [[Donovan]]. A third song, \"That's the Bag I'm In,\" written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary [[Fred Neil]], was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, \"The Third Degree\", backed by \"San Francisco Poet\", Bolan's paean to the [[beat poets]]. Neither song made the charts.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

In 1966, Bolan turned up at [[Simon Napier-Bell]]'s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album ''The Beginning of Doves''). Only \"Hippy Gumbo\", a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan's third unsuccessful single. One song, \"You Scare Me to Death,\" was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album ''[[You Scare Me to Death]]''. Napier-Bell managed [[The Yardbirds]] and [[John's Children]] and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967 he eventually settled instead for John's Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan's writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John's Children single written by Bolan called \"[[Desdemona (Marc Bolan song)|Desdemona]]\" was banned by the BBC for its line \"lift up your skirt and fly\".

His tenure with the band was brief. When the band split following an ill-fated German gig with [[The Who]], Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan's imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (''The Krakenmist'' and ''Pictures Of Purple People'') as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth - he famously claimed to have spent time with a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained \"mythical\". In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O'Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John's Children, Bolan's songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that would appear on his first albums with [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

==Tyrannosaurus Rex==
When John's Children collapsed, among other problems, the band's equipment had been repossessed by their label Track Records. But Bolan, unperturbed, rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer [[Steve Peregrin Took]] and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: \"He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.\"<ref name=\"TR1\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=T-Rex— Up Close And Personal|year=2007}}</ref> Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan's songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan's acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, \"He didn't have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he'd been forced into going acoustic because [[Track Records|Track]] had repossessed all his gear. In fact he'd been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.\"<ref name=\"TR1\" />

The original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex released three albums and four singles, flirting with the charts, reaching as high as number fifteen. They were supported with airplay by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2JYRaGZ8JJIC&pg=PA122 “Stand and Deliver: The Autobiography”]. p. 122. Pan Macmillan, 2007</ref> One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free [[List of concerts in Hyde Park|Hyde Park concert]] in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan's otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled ''The Warlock of Love''. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan's florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969-70 became one of Britain's best-selling books of poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keatsian.co.uk/keats-and-bolan.htm|title=Bolan and Keats|publisher=Keatsian.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628225345/http://www.connectedglobe.com/cgi-local/newamazon/cgapf.cgi?Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=0863599206&templates=millennium|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2013|title=Reprinted 'The Warlock of Love' by Marc Bolan|publisher=Connectedglobe.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>

In keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo's music, buying a white [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Stratocaster]] decorated with a [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] teardrop motif. After replacing Took with [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]], he let the electric influences come forward even further on ''[[A Beard of Stars]]'', the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song \"Elemental Child\", featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Bolan married his girlfriend, June Ellen Child, on 30 January 1970.<ref>{{cite news |title=My Daddy of Britpop by Marc Bolan's son |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/my-daddy-of-britpop-by-marc-bolans-son-6665946.html |accessdate=2 February 2020 |work=London Evening Standard}}</ref> She was a former secretary to the manager of another of his heroes, [[Syd Barrett]], and June was influential in raising her new husband's profile in the music industry.<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Becoming more adventurous musically, Marc bought a modified vintage [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar (featured on the cover of the album ''[[T. Rex (album)|T. Rex]]''), and then wrote and recorded his first hit \"[[Ride a White Swan]]\", which was dominated by a rolling hand-clapping back-beat, Bolan's electric guitar and Finn's percussion. At this time he also shortened the group's name to T. Rex.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

Bolan and his producer [[Tony Visconti]] oversaw the session for \"Ride a White Swan\", the single that changed Bolan's career which was inspired in part by [[Mungo Jerry]]'s success with \"[[In the Summertime (Mungo Jerry song)|In the Summertime]]\", moving Bolan away from predominantly acoustic numbers to a more electric sound.<ref name=VIS>Philip Auslander [https://books.google.com/books?id=BV6SnnkAU9IC&pg=PA84&dq=tony+visconti+t.rex&hl=en&ei=d-IETZSrNseZOouM6aYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=tony%20visconti%20t.rex&f=false Performing glam rock: gender and theatricality in popular music] University of Michigan Press, 2006</ref> Recorded on 1 July 1970 and released later that year, it made slow progress in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40]], until it finally peaked in early 1971 at number two.<ref name=\"UK Charts\">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/2746/t-rex/ |title=T.

Bolan took to wearing top hats and feather boas on stage as well as putting drops of glitter on each of his [[cheekbone]]s. Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this—some say it was introduced by his [[personal assistant]], Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child's dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then. Other performers—and their fans—soon took up variations on the idea. The era of [[glam rock|glam]] and glitter rock was born.<ref name=\"Bolan glam\"/>
[[File:Mark Bolan T-Rex (8716257007).jpg|thumb|upright|An outfit of Marc Bolan on display at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in Sydney, Australia]]
The glam era also saw the rise of Bolan's friend [[David Bowie]], whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie's 1970 single \"Prettiest Star\"; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which would continue throughout his career.

Bolan followed \"Ride a White Swan\" and ''T. Rex'' by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist [[Steve Currie]] and drummer [[Bill Legend]], and cutting a five-minute single, \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"[[Hey Jude]]\". It was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song was re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the United States, to avoid confusion with another song with the same title by the American band [[Chase (band)|Chase]]. The song reached No. 10 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in early 1972, the only top 40 single the band had in the US.<ref>Jeremy Simmonds [https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&pg=PA99&dq=get+it+on+t.rex&hl=en&ei=-t4ETejaFMyhOu6WyLIB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=get%20it%20on%20t.rex&f=false The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches (Marc Bolan)] Chicago Review Press, 2008</ref>

In November 1971, the band's record label, [[Fly Records|Fly]], released the ''[[Electric Warrior]]'' track \"[[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]]\" without Bolan's permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for [[EMI]], who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured an iconic head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan's endorsement, \"Jeepster\" peaked at number two in the UK. In 1972, Bolan achieved two more British number ones with \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Metal Guru]]\" (the latter of which stopped [[Elton John]] getting to the top with \"[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]\") and two more number twos in \"[[Children of the Revolution (song)|Children of the Revolution]]\" and \"[[Solid Gold Easy Action]]\".<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>

In the same year he appeared in [[Ringo Starr]]'s film ''[[Born to Boogie]]'', a documentary showing a concert at Wembley Empire Pool on 18 March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at [[John Lennon]]'s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and Elton John on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six percent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>

In 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend [[Jeff Lynne]] on the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] songs \"[[Ma-Ma-Ma Belle]]\" and \"Dreaming of 4000\" (originally uncredited) from ''[[On the Third Day]]'', as well as on \"Everyone's Born to Die\", which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/>

By late 1973, his pop star fame gradually began to wane, even though he achieved a number three hit, \"[[20th Century Boy]]\", in February and mid-year \"The Groover\" followed it to number four.<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/> \"Truck On (Tyke)\" missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, \"[[Teenage Dream (Marc Bolan song)|Teenage Dream]]\" from the 1974 album ''Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow'' showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend Gloria Jones on keyboards as well as backing vocals.

Eventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Legend left in 1973 and Finn in 1975 and Bolan's marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Gloria Jones. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums which, while not reaching major commercial success, were full of unusual lyrics and sometimes eccentric musical experiments. Bolan was not living healthily and began to gain weight, though he subsequently improved and continued working, producing at least one album every year.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

== Resurgence ==
[[File:Gloria Jones with son Rolan Bolan 7972.jpg|thumb|Gloria Jones with her and Marc Bolan's son Rolan in 2014]]
In September 1975 [[Gloria Jones]] gave birth to Bolan's son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as 'Rolan Seymour Feld'). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from [[tax exile]] in the US and [[Monaco]] and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show ''Supersonic'', directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, but he never regained the success of his glory days of the early 1970s. The last remaining member of Bolan's halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album, ''Dandy in the Underworld'', and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday.<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

Later in 1977, [[Granada Television]] commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called ''[[Marc (TV series)|Marc]]'' in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex's earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former [[John's Children]]-bandmate [[Andy Ellison]], then fronting the band [[Radio Stars (band)|Radio Stars]].<ref name=\"TR1\"/>

Bolan's longtime friend and sometimes rival [[David Bowie]] was the final guest on the last episode of ''Marc''. The two performed Bowie's song [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|\"Heroes\"]] near the end of the show, and after Bolan's signoff, they began to play a bluesy song over the closing credits. Right as the vocals were about to begin, however, Bolan stumbled off the stage and out of the camera frame. Bowie's amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxUAWIkiOg&list=RDkDxUAWIkiOg#t=78|title=Mark Bolan falls off stage on 'Marc' Show 6, 1977 via YouTube|accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref>
The another musical guest of note for the final posthumous episode(#1.6 or episode 6) of Marc was Generation X.   Marc Bolan's quote about another artist (SNIFF!) \"Supposed To Be As Pretty As Me\" occurs during that episode while introducing Generation X and directly refers to their lead singer Billy Idol,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3863132/|title=Episode #1.6|website=IMDdb.com|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> who was still the lead singer of Generation X at the time.

In 2013, the shrine was featured on the [[BBC Four]] series ''Pagans and Pilgrims: Britain's Holiest Places''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pagans and Pilgrims: Britain's Holiest Places|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rk2fp|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> The site, referred to as [[Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine]], is owned and maintained by the T. Rex Action Group.

Bolan never learned to drive, fearing a premature death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/e059d91d-1141-47e9-8c67-c779db4190b6|title=40 years on: 6 things you possibly didn't know about Marc Bolan|last=Hebblethwaite|first=Phil|date=15 September 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4728611/Behind-the-glitter.html|title=Behind the glitter|last=Brown|first=Mick|date=|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=}}</ref> Despite this fear, cars or automotive components are at least mentioned in, if not the subject of, many of his songs.

[[File:Bolan Bust.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine]] at the site where he died in a car crash in [[Barnes, London]], on what would have been his 60th birthday, 30 September 2007]]
Bolan was the early guitar idol of [[Johnny Marr]], who later found fame as the guitarist of the influential [[indie rock]] band [[the Smiths]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.johnny-marr.com/about| title=Johnny Marr biography| work=Official Johnny Marr website| access-date=19 October 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222021727/http://www.johnny-marr.com/about| archive-date=22 February 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1979, [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to the single \"[[The Staircase (Mystery)]]\". The band had played the song live for several years and on the first anniversary of Bolan's death in 1978 played the song as the encore when they performed at Aylesbury Friars.

In December 1980, \"Telegram Sam\" was the fourth single released by British gothic rock band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]. Also in 1980, [[the Bongos]] were the first American group, with \"Mambo Sun\", to enter the ''Billboard'' charts with a T.Rex cover. Since then, Bongos frontman [[Richard Barone]] has recorded several other Bolan compositions (\"The Visit,\" \"Ballrooms of Mars\"), worked with T.Rex producer [[Tony Visconti]] for his current solo album, ''Glow'' (2010, [[Bar/None Records]]) that includes a remake of Bolan's \"Girl\" from ''Electric Warrior'', and has himself produced tracks for Bolan's son Rolan.

In 1983, [[NWOBHM]] band [[Girlschool]] covered \"20th Century Boy\" on their [[Play Dirty (album)|Play Dirty]]. In 1984, [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] released a cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as a B-side to the single \"[[I Will Dare]]\"; it is also included on the reissue version of their album ''[[Let It Be (The Replacements album)|Let It Be]]''.<ref>{{cite press release |title=The Replacements Remastered |url=http://www.rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=546 |publisher=Rhino Records |date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222093006/http://rhino.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=546 |archivedate=22 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1985, [[Duran Duran]] splinter band [[Power Station (band)|Power Station]], with [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] as vocalist, took a version of \"Get It On\" into the UK Top 40 and to US No. 6, the first cover of a Bolan song to enter the charts since his death. They also performed the tune (with [[Michael Des Barres]] replacing Palmer) at the [[Live Aid]] concert. In 1986, [[Violent Femmes]] covered the song \"Children of the Revolution\" on their album, ''[[The Blind Leading the Naked]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first= Chris |last= Woodstra |title= Violent Femmes – The Blind Leading the Naked |publisher= AllMusic. All Media Network |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-blind-leading-the-naked-mw0000196219 |accessdate= 18 July 2013}}</ref> In 1989, [[X Japan|X]] released a live cover of \"20th Century Boy\" as the B-side to their single \"[[Kurenai (song)|Kurenai]]\". In 1990, [[Baby Ford]] did a cover of \"Children of the Revolution\" that appeared on the album ''Oooh, The World of Baby For''. In 1991, [[T-Bolan]] a Japanese rock band debuted. The name of this band was inspired by T. Rex and its vocalist Marc Bolan.

In 1993, [[Guns N' Roses]] covered \"Buick MacKane\" on ''[[The Spaghetti Incident?]]'' but it was mislabelled on the album as \"Buick Makane\". Rock guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] has worn a t-shirt with an image of Bolan on the front.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]' 1994 hit song \"[[Cigarettes & Alcohol]]\" is acknowledged as drawing strongly upon \"Get It On\" in its instrumental music. In 1993, [[Adam Ant]] covered the track live on his ''[[Persuasion (Adam Ant album)|Persuasion]]'' tour.  The song was included on a private preview show on 21 February 1993 in Burbank, Los Angeles which was recorded and released, complete with the cover version, as a live bonus CD with 1994 pressings of his ''[[Antmusic: The Very Best of Adam Ant]]'' collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adam-ant.net/1993.html |title=1993 |website=Adam-ant.net |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adam-ant.net/antmusiccompdouble.html |title=Antmusic double CD |website=Adam-ant.net |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>

The Cameron Crowe-created movie ''[[Almost Famous]]'' features a scene where a Black Sabbath groupie is telling aspiring journalist William Miller (said to be created in Crowe's own image) about how, \"Marc Bolan broke her heart, man. It's famous,\" regarding the character of Penny Lane, played by [[Kate Hudson]].<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/style/la-ig-lookback10-2008aug10-story.html “T. Rex's Marc Bolan, always famous -- and flamboyant“]. ''Los Angeles Times''. Retrieved 3 February 2019</ref> In 2000, [[Naoki Urasawa]] created a Japanese [[manga]] entitled ''[[20th Century Boys]]'' that was inspired by Marc Bolan's song, \"[[20th Century Boy]]\". The series is a multiple award-winner, and has also been released in North America. The story was adopted into three successful live-action movies from 2008 to 2009, which were also released in the US, Canada and the UK.

In 2003, [[Depeche Mode]]'s [[Martin Gore]] recorded covers of \"Life Is Strange\" and \"Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys\", and included them as b-sides of the single \"Stardust\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.depmod.com/martingore/stardust/g480.htm |title=· Depeche Mode ·Stardust · CDMUTE296 |publisher=Depmod.com |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref> In 2006, [[Def Leppard]] released their album ''[[Yeah! (Def Leppard album)|Yeah!]]'', which contains covers of their favourite bands while growing up, the first song on this album is \"20th Century Boy\". Joe Elliott wanted to sing \"Metal Guru\" while Vivian Campbell wanted \"Telegram Sam\" but end up agreeing to \"20th Century Boy\". It's not the first time that Def Leppard has sung a T.Rex song; there is a live version of Get It On. \"Children of the Revolution\" was similarly performed by [[Elton John]] and [[Pete Doherty]] of [[The Libertines]] at [[Live 8]], 20 years later. [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] and [[Gavin Friday]] also covered \"Children of the Revolution\" on the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack.

\"20th Century Boy\" introduced a new generation of devotees to Bolan's work in 1991 when it was featured on a [[Levi Strauss|Levi]]'s jeans TV commercial featuring [[Brad Pitt]], and was re-released, reaching the UK Top 20. The song was performed by the fictional band The Flaming Creatures (performed by [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], reprised by Placebo and David Bowie at the 1999 [[BRIT Awards]]) in the 1998 film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]''. In every decade since his death, a Bolan greatest hits compilation has placed in the top 20 UK albums and periodic boosts in sales have come via cover versions from artists inspired by Bolan, including [[Morrissey]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. Similarly, \"I Love to Boogie\" was briefly used on an advert for Robinson's soft drink in 2001, bringing Bolan's music to a new generation. [[Mitsubishi]] also featured \"20th Century Boy\" in a 2002 car commercial, prompting Hip-O Records to release a best-of collection CD titled ''20th Century Boy: The Ultimate Collection''.

His music is still widely used in films, recent notable cases being ''[[Breakfast on Pluto]]'', ''[[Death Proof]]'', ''[[Lords of Dogtown]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'', ''Breaking-Up'', ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', ''[[School of Rock]]'' , ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]'' and ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Wonderland (2003)|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0335563/|accessdate=2016-11-30}}</ref> Bolan is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence ([[Joy Division]]/[[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] has said that the first single he owned was \"Ride a White Swan\".) However, he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music. The tunes were never as important as the words.

Bolan had arranged a discretionary [[trust law|trust]] to safeguard his money. A small, separate [[Jersey]]-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan's fortune, variously estimated at between £20 and £30&nbsp;million (approx $38&nbsp;– $57&nbsp;million), remains in trust. As of 2007, Bolan's family is supposed to have a house paid for by the trust, and Rolan is supposed to receive an allowance.

There are two plaques dedicated to his memory at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in [[North London]]. The first was placed there in the mid-1990s in white marble and was installed by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society with the help of fans worldwide. The second was installed by the official Marc Bolan fan club and fellow fans in September 2002, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his passing. The inscription on the stone, which also bears his image, reads '25 years on&nbsp;– his light of love still shines brightly'. Placed beneath the plaque there is an appropriate ceramic figure of a white swan.

In 2006, TV series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'', William Matheson portrays Marc Bolan, circa 1973, in a bar in [[Manchester]]. Time-travelling [[Sam Tyler]] recognises him, has a fan boy moment, and warns him to be careful of riding in Minis. In the [[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|American version of the series]], the character is replaced by that of [[Jim Croce]], who died later that year in a plane crash, and Sam warns him. However, the T. Rex version of \"Get It On\" is played in the New York dance club in that scene.

In 2007, the [[English Tourist Board]] included [[Bolan's Rock Shrine]] in their guide to Important Sites of Rock 'n Roll interest 'England Rocks'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/740087/Rockin-all-over-England.html|title=Rockin' all over England|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> As reported in 2011, a school is planned in his honour, to be built in Sierra Leone: The Marc Bolan School of Music and Film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/58393|title=Marc Bolan School of Music opens in Sierra Leone|date=2 August 2011|website=Nme.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> A musical, ''20th Century Boy'', based on Bolan's life, and featuring his music, premiered at the [[New Wolsey Theatre]] in [[Ipswich]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/southeast/E8831306252498/A+Show+About+Bolan+in+Ipswich.html |title=A Show About Bolan in Ipswich |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020124308/http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/southeast/E8831306252498/A+Show+About+Bolan+in+Ipswich.html |archive-date=20 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

'''Samuel Holmes Sheppard''' ({{Birth date|1923|12|29}} – {{Death date|1970|4|6}}) was an American neurosurgeon. He was exonerated in 1966, having been convicted of the 1954 murder of his wife, Marilyn Reese Sheppard.<ref>{{cite book |last=Neff |first=James |year=2001 |title=The Wrong Man |url=https://archive.org/details/wrongmanfinalver00neff |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Random House }}</ref> The case was controversial from the beginning, with extensive and prolonged nationwide media coverage.

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] determined that the \"carnival atmosphere\" surrounding Sheppard's first trial had made [[due process]] impossible; after ten years in prison he was acquitted at a second trial.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Bay View Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bay View Hospital]]
Sheppard was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], the youngest of three sons of Richard Allen Sheppard, D.O. He attended [[Cleveland Heights High School]] where he was an excellent student and was active in American football, basketball, and track; he was class president for three years. Sheppard met his future wife, Marilyn Reese, while in high school. Although several small Ohio colleges offered him athletic scholarships, Sheppard chose to follow the lead of his father and older brothers and pursued a career in [[osteopathic medicine]]. He enrolled at [[Hanover College]] in [[Indiana]] to study pre-osteopathic medical courses, then took supplementary courses at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland. Sheppard finished his medical education at the  Los Angeles Osteopathic School of Physicians and Surgeons (now University of California Irvine) and was awarded the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O) degree.

He completed his internship and a residency in Neurosurgery at [[Los Angeles County General Hospital]]. A few years after marrying Marilyn Reese on February 21, 1945, in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Sheppard returned to Ohio and joined his father's growing medical practice at [[Bay View Hospital]].

== Murder of Marilyn Reese Sheppard ==
On the night of July 3, 1954, Sheppard and Marilyn were entertaining neighbors at their lakefront home (demolished in 1993)<ref>

The property itself abutted the shore of [[Lake Erie]], near the west end of Huntington Reservation.  While they were watching the movie ''[[Strange Holiday (1946 film)|Strange Holiday]]'', Sheppard fell asleep on the daybed in the living room. Marilyn walked the neighbors out.

In the early morning hours of July 4, 1954, Marilyn Sheppard was bludgeoned to death in her bed with an unknown instrument. The bedroom was covered with blood spatter and drops of blood were found on floors throughout the house. Some items from the house, including Sam Sheppard's wristwatch, keychain and key, and fraternity ring, appeared to have been stolen.<ref name=QofEvidence/>  They were later found in a canvas bag in shrubbery behind the house.<ref name=QofEvidence>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Colin |title=A Question of Evidence: The Casebook of Great Forensic Controversies, from Napoleon to O.

He ran upstairs where he saw a “white form” in the bedroom and then he was knocked unconscious. When he awoke, he saw the person downstairs, chased the intruder out of the house down to the beach where they tussled and Sheppard was knocked unconscious again.

At 5:40 am, a neighbor received an urgent phone call from Sheppard who pleaded for him to come to his home. When the neighbor and his wife arrived, Sheppard was found shirtless and his pants were wet with a bloodstain on the knee. Authorities arrived shortly thereafter. Sheppard seemed disoriented and in shock.<ref>{{cite book |last=Neff |first=James |year=2001 |title=The Wrong Man |url=https://archive.org/details/wrongmanfinalver00neff |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Random House |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wrongmanfinalver00neff/page/5 5–9]}}</ref> The family dog was not heard barking to indicate an intruder, and their seven-year-old son, Sam Reese \"Chip\" Sheppard, was asleep in the adjacent bedroom during the whole ordeal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/26/us/after-life-of-notoriety-and-pain-son-tries-to-solve-his-mother-smurder.html|last=Butterfield|first=Fox|title=After Life of Notoriety and Pain, Son Tries to Solve His Mother's Murder|work=The New York Times|date=March 26, 1996|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}</ref>

== First trial ==
Sheppard's trial began October 18, 1954.

=== Media ===
The murder investigation and the trial were notable for the extensive publicity. Some newspapers and other media in [[Ohio]] were accused of bias against Sheppard and inflammatory coverage of the case, and were criticized for immediately labeling him the only viable suspect. A federal judge later criticized the media, \"If ever there was a trial by newspaper, this is a perfect example. And the most insidious example was the ''[[Cleveland Press]]''. For some reason that newspaper took upon itself the role of accuser, judge and jury.\"<ref>Neff 2001, p. 230</ref>

It appeared that the local media influenced the investigators. On July 21, 1954, the ''Cleveland Press'' ran a front-page editorial titled \"Do It Now, Dr. Gerber\" which called for a public [[inquest]]. Hours later, Dr. Samuel Gerber, the coroner investigating the murder, announced that he would hold an inquest the next day.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 85</ref> The ''Cleveland Press'' ran another front-page editorial titled \"Why Isn't Sam Sheppard in Jail?\" on July 30 which was titled in later editions, \"Quit Stalling and Bring Him In!\".<ref>[http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/gvpt339/sheppard.html The Sam Sheppard Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040907234728/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/gvpt339/sheppard.html |date=September 7, 2004 }}, umd.edu; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/2001-11-08-wrong-man.htm|work=USA Today|title='Wrong Man' makes case for Sheppard's innocence|date=November 8, 2001|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> That night, Sheppard was arrested for a police interrogation.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 101-02</ref>

The local media ran salacious front-page stories inflammatory to Sheppard which had no supporting facts or were later disproved. During the trial, a popular radio show broadcast a report about a New York City woman who claimed to be his mistress and the mother of his illegitimate child. Since the jury was not [[jury sequestration|sequestered]], two of the jurors admitted to the judge that they heard the broadcast but the judge did not dismiss them.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 151-52</ref> From interviews with some of the jurors years later, it is likely that jurors were contaminated by the press before the trial and perhaps during it.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 166-68</ref>

===Prosecution's theory===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
The high-profile nature of the case proved to be a boon to lead prosecutor John J. Mahon, who was running for a seat on the [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] as the trial began. Mahon won his seat, and served until his death on January 31, 1962.

Prosecutors learned during their investigation and revealed at trial that Sheppard had carried on a three-year-long extramarital affair with Susan Hayes, a [[nurse]] at the hospital where Sheppard was employed. The prosecution argued that the affair was Sheppard's motive for killing his wife. Mahon made the most of the case in the absence of any direct evidence against the defendant, other than that he was inside the house when Marilyn Sheppard was killed. Mahon emphasized the inconsistencies in Sam Sheppard's story and that he could not give an accurate description of the intruder in his house.

Other issues brought up at trial involved why there was no sand in his hair when Sheppard claimed to have been sprawled at the beach, and Sheppard's missing T-shirt, which the prosecutor speculated would or should contain some of Sheppard's blood (having been in an alleged struggle with the perpetrator). However, Prosecutor Mahon chose to make these assertions despite no T-shirt ever being found or presented as evidence. Also, part of the prosecution's case centered around (speculative) questions like why a burglar would first take the belongings in the canvas bag, only to later ditch them in bushes outside the Sheppard home.  It was under these circumstances that Mahon openly speculated Sheppard had staged the crime scene.

Lack of a murder weapon posed problems for the prosecution, but Cuyahoga County Coroner Samuel R. Gerber nearly circumvented this discrepancy by testifying that a blood imprint found on the pillow beneath Marilyn Sheppard's head was made by a \"two-blade surgical instrument with teeth at the end of each blade\" such as a scalpel. Inexplicably, Sheppard's lawyers left this vague assertion unchallenged. Sheppard's lawyer was denied access to the physical evidence by the judge and therefore could not argue any assertions as to blood droplets, murder weapon marks, blood spatter, physical marks on the body, etc.

===Defense strategy===
Sheppard's attorney, William Corrigan, argued that Sheppard had severe injuries and that these injuries were inflicted by the intruder. Corrigan based his argument on the report made by neurosurgeon Dr. Charles Elkins, M.D., who examined Sheppard and found he had suffered a cervical concussion, nerve injury, many absent or weak reflexes (most notably on the left side of his body), and injury in the region of the second cervical vertebra in the back of the neck. Dr. Elkins stated that it was impossible to fake or simulate the missing reflex responses.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The defense further argued the crime scene was extremely bloody, yet the only blood evidence appearing on Sheppard was a bloodstain on his trousers. Corrigan also argued two of Marilyn's teeth had been broken and that the pieces had been pulled from her mouth, suggesting she had possibly bitten her assailant. He told the jury that Sheppard had no open wounds. (Some{{who|date=February 2013}} observers have questioned the accuracy of claims that Marilyn Sheppard lost her teeth while biting her attacker, arguing that her missing teeth are more consistent with the severe beating Marilyn Sheppard received to her face and skull.<ref name=cnn>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9910/05/sheppard.case|title=Body of Sam Sheppard's wife exhumed in Ohio|date=October 5, 1999|publisher=CNN.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040919212714/http://edition.cnn.com/US/9910/05/sheppard.case|archivedate=2004-09-19}}</ref>) However, as criminologist [[Paul L. Kirk]] later pointed out, if the beating had broken Mrs. Sheppard's teeth, pieces would have been found inside her mouth, and her lips would have been severely damaged, which was not the case.<ref>Affidavit of Paul L. Kirk, filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Branch, No. 64571</ref>

Sheppard took the stand in his own defense, testifying that he had been sleeping downstairs on a daybed when he awoke to his wife's screams.

{{quote|I think that she cried or screamed my name once or twice, during which time I ran upstairs, thinking that she might be having a reaction similar to convulsions that she had in the early days of her pregnancy. I charged into our room and saw a form with a light garment, I believe, at that time grappling with something or someone. During this short period I could hear loud moans or groaning sounds and noises. I was struck down. It seems like I was hit from behind somehow but had grappled this individual from in front or generally in front of me. I was apparently knocked out. The next thing I knew, I was gathering my senses while coming to a sitting position next to the bed, my feet toward the hallway. ... I looked at my wife, I believe I took her pulse and felt that she was gone. I believe that I thereafter instinctively or subconsciously ran into my youngster's room next door and somehow determined that he was all right, I am not sure how I determined this. After that, I thought that I heard a noise downstairs, seemingly in the front eastern portion of the house.<ref>{{cite book|last1=DeSario|first1=Jack|last2=Mason|first2=William D.|title=Dr. Sam Sheppard on Trial: The Prosecutors and the Marilyn Sheppard Murder|year=2003|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=0-873-38770-8|page=345}}</ref>}}

Sheppard ran back downstairs and chased what he described as a \"bushy-haired intruder\" or \"form\" down to the [[Lake Erie]] beach below his home, before being knocked out again. The defense called eighteen character witnesses for Sheppard, and two witnesses who said that they had seen a bushy-haired man near the Sheppard home on the day of the crime.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On December 21, after deliberating for four days, the jury found Sheppard guilty of second-degree [[murder]].{{sfn|Warnes|2004|page=252}} He was sentenced to life in prison.{{sfn|DeSario|Mason|2003|page=6}} On January 7, 1955, shortly after his conviction, Sheppard was told that his mother, Ethel Sheppard, had committed [[suicide]] by gunshot.{{sfn|Tanay|2011|page=175}} Eleven days later, Sheppard's father, Dr. Richard Sheppard, died of a bleeding [[gastric ulcer]] and [[stomach cancer]].{{sfn|Warnes|2004|page=219}} Sheppard was permitted to attend both funerals but was required to wear [[handcuffs]].{{sfn|Perper|Cina|2010|page=38}}

==Appeals and retrial==
===Appeals===
Sheppard's attorney William Corrigan spent six years making appeals but all were rejected. On July 30, 1961, Corrigan died and [[F. Lee Bailey]] took over as Sheppard's chief counsel. Bailey's petition for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' was granted on July 15, 1964, by a [[United States district court]] judge who called the 1954 trial a \"mockery of justice\" that shredded Sheppard's Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process. The State of [[Ohio]] was ordered to release Sheppard on bond and gave the prosecutor 60 days to bring charges against him, otherwise the case would be dismissed permanently.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 226-230</ref> The State of Ohio appealed the ruling to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals Court for the Sixth Circuit]], which on March 4, 1965 reversed the federal judge's ruling.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 238</ref> Bailey appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in ''[[Sheppard v. Maxwell]]''. On June 6, 1966, the Supreme Court, by an 8-to-1 vote, struck down the murder conviction. The decision noted, among other factors, that a \"carnival atmosphere\" had permeated the trial, and that the trial judge, [[Edward J. Blythin]],<ref name=statement>{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/sheppard_trial/media.htm |title=The Media and the Trial |publisher=Providence.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613195225/http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/sheppard_trial/media.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> who had died in 1958, was biased against Sheppard because Judge Blythin had refused to sequester the [[jury]], did not order the jury to ignore and disregard media reports of the case, and when speaking to newspaper columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] shortly before the trial started said, \"Well, he's guilty as hell.  There's no question about it.\"

Sheppard served ten years of his sentence. Three days after his 1964 release, he married Ariane Tebbenjohanns, a German divorcee who had corresponded with him during his imprisonment. The two had been engaged since January 1963. Tebbenjohanns endured her own bit of controversy shortly after the engagement had been announced, confirming that her half-sister was [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Ritschel]], the wife of [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda]] chief [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Tebbenjohanns emphasized that she held no Nazi views. On October 7, 1969, Sheppard and Tebbenjohanns divorced.<ref>[http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/sheppard/timeline_ctv.html Court TV Online – Sheppard]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514003333/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/sheppard/timeline_ctv.html |date=May 14, 2006 }}</ref>

=== Retrial ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
Jury selection began October 24, 1966, and opening statements began eight days later. Media interest in the trial remained high, but this jury was [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]]. The prosecutor presented essentially the same case as was presented twelve years earlier. Bailey aggressively sought to discredit each prosecution witness during cross-examination. When Coroner Samuel Gerber testified about a murder weapon which he described as a \"surgical weapon\", Bailey led Gerber to admit that they never found a murder weapon<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.famous-trials.com/sam-sheppard/2-sheppard|title=Dr. Sam Sheppard Trials: An Account|last=Linder|first=Professor Douglas O.|date=2017|website=Famous Trials - UKMC School of Law|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-16}}</ref> and had nothing to tie Sheppard to the murder. In his closing argument, Bailey scathingly dismissed the prosecution's case against Sheppard as \"ten pounds of hogwash in a five-pound bag\".

Unlike in the original trial, neither Sheppard nor Susan Hayes took the stand, a strategy that proved to be successful.<ref name=\":0\" /> After deliberating for 12 hours, the jury returned on November 16 with a \"not guilty\" verdict. The trial was very important to Bailey's rise to prominence among American criminal defense lawyers. It was during this trial that [[Paul L. Kirk|Paul Kirk]] presented the [[bloodstain pattern analysis|bloodspatter evidence]] he collected in Sheppard's home in 1955 which suggested that the murderer was left-handed (Sheppard was right-handed) proved crucial to his acquittal.<ref name=\":0\" />

Three weeks after the trial, Sheppard appeared as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.

After his acquittal, Sheppard helped write the book ''Endure and Conquer'', which presented his side of the case and gave insight into his years in prison.

== Late medical practice, remarriage, and death ==
After his release from prison, Sheppard opened a medical office in the Columbus suburb of [[Gahanna, Ohio]].  On May 10, 1968, Sheppard was granted surgical privileges at the Youngstown Osteopathic Hospital,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=djft3U1LymYC&dat=19680426&printsec=frontpage&hl=en \"Youngstown Hospital Hires Dr. Sheppard\"], ''Pittsburgh Press'', April 26, 1968, p5</ref> but \"[his] skills as a surgeon had deteriorated, and much of the time he was impaired by alcohol\".<ref name=Neff/> Five days after he was granted privileges, he performed a [[discectomy]] on a woman and accidentally cut an artery; the patient died the next day.

==Civil trial for wrongful imprisonment==
[[File:Sam and marilyn sheppard crypt - knollwood cemetery.jpg|thumb|Sam and Marilyn Sheppard crypt at Knollwood Cemetery]]

In 1999, Alan Davis, a lifelong friend of Sheppard<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGunagle |first1=Fred |title=The Case of Dr. Samuel Sheppard: Who Killed Marilyn? |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/sheppard/marilyn_18.html |website=CrimeLibrary|accessdate=February 16, 2015}}</ref> and administrator of his estate, sued the State of Ohio in the Cuyahoga County [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] for Sheppard's wrongful imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McGunagle|first1=Fred|title=The Case of Dr. Samuel Sheppard: The Third Trial|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/sheppard/trial_15.html|website=CrimeLibrary|accessdate=February 16, 2015}}

After Davis's death in 1999, Charles Murray, who was appointed by the Franklin County Probate Court as the new administrator for the estate, was substituted as plaintiff.  ''Davis v. State'', Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Case No. CV96-312322, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_court_filings_2000/138/ Plaintiff's Motion for Substitution of Party], February 17, 2000; retrieved February 16, 2015.</ref>

By order of the court, Marilyn Sheppard's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]], in part to determine if the [[fetus]] she was carrying had been fathered by Sheppard. Terry Gilbert, an [[Lawyer|attorney]] retained by the Sheppard family, told the media that \"the [[fetus]] in this case had previously been [[autopsy|autopsied]]\", a fact that had never previously been disclosed. This, Gilbert argued, raised questions about the coroner's office in the original case possibly concealing pertinent evidence.<ref name=cnn/> Due to the passage of time and the effect of [[formaldehyde]] on the fetus's tissues, paternity could not be established.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Richard Eberling===
During the civil trial, plaintiff attorney Terry Gilbert contended that Richard Eberling, an occasional handyman and window washer at the Sheppard home, was the likeliest suspect in Marilyn's murder. Eberling found Marilyn attractive and he was very familiar with the layout of the Sheppard home.<ref>Linder, Douglas O., [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/sheppard/eberlinginfo.html “Dr. Sam Sheppard Trials”], University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref>

In 1959, detectives were questioning Richard Eberling on various burglaries in the area. Eberling confessed to the burglaries and showed the detectives his loot, which included two rings that belonged to Marilyn Sheppard. Eberling stole the rings in 1958, a few years after the murder, from Sam Sheppard's brother's house, taken from a box marked \"Personal Property of Marilyn Sheppard\".<ref>Cleveland Police Department, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/plaintiff_exhibits_2000/113 \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 0022: Eberling Statement\" (1959)], Sheppard 2000 Trial Plaintiff's Exhibits. Book 113.</ref> In subsequent questioning, Eberling admitted his blood was at the crime scene of Marilyn Sheppard. He stated that he cut his finger while washing windows just prior to the murder and bled while on the premises.<ref>Tompkins, James R., \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 0020: Bay Village Police Report re: Eberling\" (1988). Sheppard 2000 Trial Plaintiff's Exhibits. Book 114. http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/plaintiff_exhibits_2000/114</ref> As part of the investigation, Eberling took a polygraph test with questions about the murder of Marilyn. The polygraph examiner concluded that Eberling did not show deception in his answers, although the polygraph results were evaluated by other experts years later who found that it was either inconclusive or Eberling was deceptive.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 212, 352</ref>

In his testimony in the 2000 civil lawsuit, Bailey stated that he rejected Eberling as a suspect in 1966 because \"I thought he passed a good polygraph test.\" When it was presented to Bailey that an independent polygraph expert said Eberling either murdered Marilyn or had knowledge of who did, Bailey stated that he probably would have presented Eberling as a suspect in the 1966 retrial.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 351-52</ref>

[[DNA]] evidence, which was not available in the two murder trials, played an important role in the civil trial. DNA analysis of blood at the crime scene showed that there was presence of blood from a third person, other than Marilyn and Dr. Sam Sheppard.<ref>Chakarborty, Ranajit, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_dna/17 \"Chakraborty Report on DNA Typing Involving Richard Eberling, Sam Sheppard, and Marilyn Sheppard\" (2000)],. Blood Evidence and DNA – Sam Sheppard Case. Book 17.</ref>

With regard to tying the blood to Eberling, the DNA analysis that was allowed to be admitted to the trial was inconclusive. A plaintiff DNA expert was 90% confident that one of the blood spots belonged to Richard Eberling but, according to the rules of the court, this was not admissible. The defense argued that the blood evidence had been tainted in the years since it was collected, and that an important blood spot on the closet door in Marilyn Sheppard's room potentially included 83% of the adult white population. The defense also pointed out that the results in 1955 from the older blood typing technique, that the blood collected from the closet door was Type O, while Eberling's [[ABO blood group system|blood type]] was Type A.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 364-367</ref>

Throughout his life, Richard Eberling was associated with women who had suspicious deaths and he was convicted of murdering Ethel May Durkin, a wealthy, elderly widow who died without any immediate family. Durkin's 1984 murder in [[Lakewood, Ohio]], was uncovered when a court-appointed review of the woman's estate revealed that Eberling, Durkin's guardian and executor, had failed to execute her final wishes, which included stipulations on her burial.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Durkin's body was exhumed and additional injuries were discovered in the autopsy that did not match Eberling's previous claims of in-house accidents, including a fall down a staircase in her home.  In subsequent legal action, both Eberling and his partner, Obie Henderson, were found guilty in Durkin's death. Coincidentally, both of Durkin's sisters, Myrtle Fray and Sarah Belle Farrow, had died under suspicious circumstances as well. Fray was killed after being \"savagely\" beaten about the head and face and then strangled; Farrow died following a fall down the basement steps in the home she shared with Durkin in 1970, a fall in which she broke both legs and both arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Although Eberling denied any criminal involvement in the murder of Marilyn Sheppard,<ref>[http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/famouspeople/a/sheppard.htm Sam Sheppard Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917234853/http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/famouspeople/a/sheppard.htm |date=September 17, 2005 }}, columbusoh.about.com; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref> Kathy Wagner Dyal, who worked alongside Eberling in caring for Ethel May Durkin, also testified that Eberling had confessed to her in 1983.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 298</ref> A fellow convict also reported that Eberling confessed to the crime. The defense called into question the credibility of both witnesses during the 2000 civil trial. Eberling died in an Ohio prison in 1998, where he was serving a [[life sentence]] for the 1984 murder of Ethel May Durkin.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Defense===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Steve Dever led the defense trial team for the State of Ohio, which included assistant prosecutors Dean Maynard Boland and Kathleen Martin. They argued that Sheppard was the most logical suspect, and presented expert testimony suggesting that Marilyn Sheppard's murder was a textbook domestic [[homicide]]. They argued that Sheppard had not welcomed the news of his wife's pregnancy, he wanted to continue his affairs with Susan Hayes and with other women, and he was concerned about the [[social stigma]] that a divorce might create.  They claimed the evidence showed that Marilyn Sheppard may have hit Sam Sheppard, sparking an angry rage that resulted in her bludgeoning. Boland evaluated evidence that had been considered by fifty years of investigators, journalists and others, and during the trial he was the first to suggest that the murder weapon used by Sam Sheppard was a bedroom lamp.

The defense asked why Sheppard had not called out for help, why he had neatly folded his jacket on the daybed in which he said he had fallen asleep, and why the family dog, which several witnesses had testified (in the first trial in 1954) was very loud when strangers came to the house, had not barked on the night of the murder (implying that the dog knew the killer).

===Verdict===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
After ten weeks of trial, 76 witnesses, and hundreds of exhibits, the case went to the eight-person civil jury. The jury deliberated just three hours on April 12, 2000, before returning a unanimous [[verdict]] that Samuel Reese Sheppard had failed to prove that his father had been wrongfully imprisoned.

===Invalidation of wrongful imprisonment claim===
On February 22, 2002, the [[Ohio District Courts of Appeals|Eighth District Court of Appeals]] ruled unanimously that the civil case should not have gone to the jury, on the grounds that the [[statute of limitations]] had expired, and that a claim for wrongful imprisonment abated with Sam Sheppard's death.<ref>''[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_court_filings_2000/2 Murray v.

'''Samuel Holmes Sheppard''' ({{Birth date|1923|12|29}} – {{Death date|1970|4|6}}) was an American neurosurgeon. He was exonerated in 1966, having been convicted of the 1954 murder of his wife, Marilyn Reese Sheppard.<ref>{{cite book |last=Neff |first=James |year=2001 |title=The Wrong Man |url=https://archive.org/details/wrongmanfinalver00neff |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Random House }}</ref> The case was controversial from the beginning, with extensive and prolonged nationwide media coverage.

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] determined that the \"carnival atmosphere\" surrounding Sheppard's first trial had made [[due process]] impossible; after ten years in prison he was acquitted at a second trial.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Bay View Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bay View Hospital]]
Sheppard was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], the youngest of three sons of Richard Allen Sheppard, D.O. He attended [[Cleveland Heights High School]] where he was an excellent student and was active in American football, basketball, and track; he was class president for three years. Sheppard met his future wife, Marilyn Reese, while in high school. Although several small Ohio colleges offered him athletic scholarships, Sheppard chose to follow the lead of his father and older brothers and pursued a career in [[osteopathic medicine]]. He enrolled at [[Hanover College]] in [[Indiana]] to study pre-osteopathic medical courses, then took supplementary courses at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland. Sheppard finished his medical education at the  Los Angeles Osteopathic School of Physicians and Surgeons (now University of California Irvine) and was awarded the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O) degree.

He completed his internship and a residency in Neurosurgery at [[Los Angeles County General Hospital]]. A few years after marrying Marilyn Reese on February 21, 1945, in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Sheppard returned to Ohio and joined his father's growing medical practice at [[Bay View Hospital]].

The property itself abutted the shore of [[Lake Erie]], near the west end of Huntington Reservation.  While they were watching the movie ''[[Strange Holiday (1946 film)|Strange Holiday]]'', Sheppard fell asleep on the daybed in the living room. Marilyn walked the neighbors out.

In the early morning hours of July 4, 1954, Marilyn Sheppard was bludgeoned to death in her bed with an unknown instrument. The bedroom was covered with blood spatter and drops of blood were found on floors throughout the house. Some items from the house, including Sam Sheppard's wristwatch, keychain and key, and fraternity ring, appeared to have been stolen.<ref name=QofEvidence/>  They were later found in a canvas bag in shrubbery behind the house.<ref name=QofEvidence>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Colin |title=A Question of Evidence: The Casebook of Great Forensic Controversies, from Napoleon to O.

He ran upstairs where he saw a form in the bedroom and then he was knocked unconscious. When he awoke, he saw the person downstairs, chased the intruder out of the house down to the beach where they tussled and Sheppard was knocked unconscious again.

At 5:40 am, a neighbor received an urgent phone call from Sheppard who pleaded for him to come to his home. When the neighbor and his wife arrived, Sheppard was found shirtless and his pants were wet with a bloodstain on the knee. Authorities arrived shortly thereafter.

== First trial ==
Sheppard's trial began October 18, 1954.

=== Media ===
The murder investigation and the trial were notable for the extensive publicity. Some newspapers and other media in [[Ohio]] were accused of bias against Sheppard and inflammatory coverage of the case, and were criticized for immediately labeling him the only viable suspect. A federal judge later criticized the media, \"If ever there was a trial by newspaper, this is a perfect example. And the most insidious example was the ''[[Cleveland Press]]''. For some reason that newspaper took upon itself the role of accuser, judge and jury.\"<ref>Neff 2001, p. 230</ref>

It appeared that the local media influenced the investigators. On July 21, 1954, the ''Cleveland Press'' ran a front-page editorial titled \"Do It Now, Dr. Gerber\" which called for a public [[inquest]]. Hours later, Dr. Samuel Gerber, the coroner investigating the murder, announced that he would hold an inquest the next day.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 85</ref> The ''Cleveland Press'' ran another front-page editorial titled \"Why Isn't Sam Sheppard in Jail?\" on July 30 which was titled in later editions, \"Quit Stalling and Bring Him In!\".<ref>[http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/gvpt339/sheppard.html The Sam Sheppard Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040907234728/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/gvpt339/sheppard.html |date=September 7, 2004 }}, umd.edu; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/2001-11-08-wrong-man.htm|work=USA Today|title='Wrong Man' makes case for Sheppard's innocence|date=November 8, 2001|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> That night, Sheppard was arrested for a police interrogation.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 101-02</ref>

The local media ran salacious front-page stories inflammatory to Sheppard which had no supporting facts or were later disproved. During the trial, a popular radio show broadcast a report about a New York City woman who claimed to be his mistress and the mother of his illegitimate child. Since the jury was not [[jury sequestration|sequestered]], two of the jurors admitted to the judge that they heard the broadcast but the judge did not dismiss them.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 151-52</ref> From interviews with some of the jurors years later, it is likely that jurors were contaminated by the press before the trial and perhaps during it.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 166-68</ref>

The U.S. Supreme Court later called the trial a \"carnival atmosphere\".<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=384&invol=333 ''Sheppard v. Maxwell''], 384 U.S. 333, 358 (1964) (U.S. Supreme Court)</ref>

===Prosecution's theory===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
The high-profile nature of the case proved to be a boon to lead prosecutor John J. Mahon, who was running for a seat on the [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] as the trial began. Mahon won his seat, and served until his death on January 31, 1962.

Prosecutors learned during their investigation and revealed at trial that Sheppard had carried on a three-year-long extramarital affair with Susan Hayes, a [[nurse]] at the hospital where Sheppard was employed. The prosecution argued that the affair was Sheppard's motive for killing his wife. Mahon made the most of the case in the absence of any direct evidence against the defendant, other than that he was inside the house when Marilyn Sheppard was killed. Mahon emphasized the inconsistencies in Sam Sheppard's story and that he could not give an accurate description of the intruder in his house.

Other issues brought up at trial involved why there was no sand in his hair when Sheppard claimed to have been sprawled at the beach, and Sheppard's missing T-shirt, which the prosecutor speculated would or should contain some of Sheppard's blood (having been in an alleged struggle with the perpetrator). However, Prosecutor Mahon chose to make these assertions despite no T-shirt ever being found or presented as evidence. Also, part of the prosecution's case centered around (speculative) questions like why a burglar would first take the belongings in the canvas bag, only to later ditch them in bushes outside the Sheppard home.  It was under these circumstances that Mahon openly speculated Sheppard had staged the crime scene.

Lack of a murder weapon posed problems for the prosecution, but Cuyahoga County Coroner Samuel R. Gerber nearly circumvented this discrepancy by testifying that a blood imprint found on the pillow beneath Marilyn Sheppard's head was made by a \"two-blade surgical instrument with teeth at the end of each blade\" such as a scalpel. Inexplicably, Sheppard's lawyers left this vague assertion unchallenged. Sheppard's lawyer was denied access to the physical evidence by the judge and therefore could not argue any assertions as to blood droplets, murder weapon marks, blood spatter, physical marks on the body, etc.

===Defense strategy===
Sheppard's attorney, William Corrigan, argued that Sheppard had severe injuries and that these injuries were inflicted by the intruder. Corrigan based his argument on the report made by neurosurgeon Dr. Charles Elkins, M.D., who examined Sheppard and found he had suffered a cervical concussion, nerve injury, many absent or weak reflexes (most notably on the left side of his body), and injury in the region of the second cervical vertebra in the back of the neck. Dr. Elkins stated that it was impossible to fake or simulate the missing reflex responses.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The defense further argued the crime scene was extremely bloody, yet the only blood evidence appearing on Sheppard was a bloodstain on his trousers. Corrigan also argued two of Marilyn's teeth had been broken and that the pieces had been pulled from her mouth, suggesting she had possibly bitten her assailant. He told the jury that Sheppard had no open wounds. (Some{{who|date=February 2013}} observers have questioned the accuracy of claims that Marilyn Sheppard lost her teeth while biting her attacker, arguing that her missing teeth are more consistent with the severe beating Marilyn Sheppard received to her face and skull.<ref name=cnn>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9910/05/sheppard.case|title=Body of Sam Sheppard's wife exhumed in Ohio|date=October 5, 1999|publisher=CNN.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040919212714/http://edition.cnn.com/US/9910/05/sheppard.case|archivedate=2004-09-19}}</ref>) However, as criminologist [[Paul L.

Sheppard took the stand in his own defense, testifying that he had been sleeping downstairs on a daybed when he awoke to his wife's screams.

{{quote|I think that she cried or screamed my name once or twice, during which time I ran upstairs, thinking that she might be having a reaction similar to convulsions that she had in the early days of her pregnancy. I charged into our room and saw a form with a light garment, I believe, at that time grappling with something or someone. During this short period I could hear loud moans or groaning sounds and noises. I was struck down. It seems like I was hit from behind somehow but had grappled this individual from in front or generally in front of me. I was apparently knocked out. The next thing I knew, I was gathering my senses while coming to a sitting position next to the bed, my feet toward the hallway. ... I looked at my wife, I believe I took her pulse and felt that she was gone. I believe that I thereafter instinctively or subconsciously ran into my youngster's room next door and somehow determined that he was all right, I am not sure how I determined this. After that, I thought that I heard a noise downstairs, seemingly in the front eastern portion of the house.<ref>{{cite book|last1=DeSario|first1=Jack|last2=Mason|first2=William D.|title=Dr. Sam Sheppard on Trial: The Prosecutors and the Marilyn Sheppard Murder|year=2003|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=0-873-38770-8|page=345}}</ref>}}

Sheppard ran back downstairs and chased what he described as a \"bushy-haired intruder\" or \"form\" down to the [[Lake Erie]] beach below his home, before being knocked out again. The defense called eighteen character witnesses for Sheppard, and two witnesses who said that they had seen a bushy-haired man near the Sheppard home on the day of the crime.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Appeals and retrial==
===Appeals===
Sheppard's attorney William Corrigan spent six years making appeals but all were rejected. On July 30, 1961, Corrigan died and [[F. Lee Bailey]] took over as Sheppard's chief counsel. Bailey's petition for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' was granted on July 15, 1964, by a [[United States district court]] judge who called the 1954 trial a \"mockery of justice\" that shredded Sheppard's Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process. The State of [[Ohio]] was ordered to release Sheppard on bond and gave the prosecutor 60 days to bring charges against him, otherwise the case would be dismissed permanently.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 226-230</ref> The State of Ohio appealed the ruling to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals Court for the Sixth Circuit]], which on March 4, 1965 reversed the federal judge's ruling.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 238</ref> Bailey appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in ''[[Sheppard v. Maxwell]]''. On June 6, 1966, the Supreme Court, by an 8-to-1 vote, struck down the murder conviction. The decision noted, among other factors, that a \"carnival atmosphere\" had permeated the trial, and that the trial judge, [[Edward J. Blythin]],<ref name=statement>{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/sheppard_trial/media.htm |title=The Media and the Trial |publisher=Providence.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613195225/http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/sheppard_trial/media.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> who had died in 1958, was biased against Sheppard because Judge Blythin had refused to sequester the [[jury]], did not order the jury to ignore and disregard media reports of the case, and when speaking to newspaper columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] shortly before the trial started said, \"Well, he's guilty as hell.  There's no question about it.\"

Sheppard served ten years of his sentence. Three days after his 1964 release, he married Ariane Tebbenjohanns, a German divorcee who had corresponded with him during his imprisonment. The two had been engaged since January 1963. Tebbenjohanns endured her own bit of controversy shortly after the engagement had been announced, confirming that her half-sister was [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Ritschel]], the wife of [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda]] chief [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Tebbenjohanns emphasized that she held no Nazi views. On October 7, 1969, Sheppard and Tebbenjohanns divorced.<ref>[http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/sheppard/timeline_ctv.html Court TV Online – Sheppard]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514003333/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/sheppard/timeline_ctv.html |date=May 14, 2006 }}</ref>

=== Retrial ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
Jury selection began October 24, 1966, and opening statements began eight days later. Media interest in the trial remained high, but this jury was [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]]. The prosecutor presented essentially the same case as was presented twelve years earlier. Bailey aggressively sought to discredit each prosecution witness during cross-examination. When Coroner Samuel Gerber testified about a murder weapon which he described as a \"surgical weapon\", Bailey led Gerber to admit that they never found a murder weapon<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.famous-trials.com/sam-sheppard/2-sheppard|title=Dr. Sam Sheppard Trials: An Account|last=Linder|first=Professor Douglas O.|date=2017|website=Famous Trials - UKMC School of Law|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-16}}</ref> and had nothing to tie Sheppard to the murder. In his closing argument, Bailey scathingly dismissed the prosecution's case against Sheppard as \"ten pounds of hogwash in a five-pound bag\".

Unlike in the original trial, neither Sheppard nor Susan Hayes took the stand, a strategy that proved to be successful.<ref name=\":0\" /> After deliberating for 12 hours, the jury returned on November 16 with a \"not guilty\" verdict. The trial was very important to Bailey's rise to prominence among American criminal defense lawyers. It was during this trial that [[Paul L. Kirk|Paul Kirk]] presented the [[bloodstain pattern analysis|bloodspatter evidence]] he collected in Sheppard's home in 1955 which suggested that the murderer was left-handed (Sheppard was right-handed) proved crucial to his acquittal.<ref name=\":0\" />

Three weeks after the trial, Sheppard appeared as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.

After his acquittal, Sheppard helped write the book ''Endure and Conquer'', which presented his side of the case and gave insight into his years in prison.

== Late medical practice, remarriage, and death ==
After his release from prison, Sheppard opened a medical office in the Columbus suburb of [[Gahanna, Ohio]].  On May 10, 1968, Sheppard was granted surgical privileges at the Youngstown Osteopathic Hospital,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=djft3U1LymYC&dat=19680426&printsec=frontpage&hl=en \"Youngstown Hospital Hires Dr. Sheppard\"], ''Pittsburgh Press'', April 26, 1968, p5</ref> but \"[his] skills as a surgeon had deteriorated, and much of the time he was impaired by alcohol\".<ref name=Neff/> Five days after he was granted privileges, he performed a [[discectomy]] on a woman and accidentally cut an artery; the patient died the next day.

==Civil trial for wrongful imprisonment==
[[File:Sam and marilyn sheppard crypt - knollwood cemetery.jpg|thumb|Sam and Marilyn Sheppard crypt at Knollwood Cemetery]]
Sheppard's son, Samuel Reese Sheppard, has devoted considerable time and effort towards attempting to clear his father's reputation.<ref>[http://www.samreesesheppard.org \"Seeking the Truth\"], samreesesheppard.org; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref>

In 1999, Alan Davis, a lifelong friend of Sheppard<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGunagle |first1=Fred |title=The Case of Dr. Samuel Sheppard: Who Killed Marilyn? |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/sheppard/marilyn_18.html |website=CrimeLibrary|accessdate=February 16, 2015}}</ref> and administrator of his estate, sued the State of Ohio in the Cuyahoga County [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] for Sheppard's wrongful imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McGunagle|first1=Fred|title=The Case of Dr. Samuel Sheppard: The Third Trial|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/sheppard/trial_15.html|website=CrimeLibrary|accessdate=February 16, 2015}}

After Davis's death in 1999, Charles Murray, who was appointed by the Franklin County Probate Court as the new administrator for the estate, was substituted as plaintiff.  ''Davis v. State'', Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Case No. CV96-312322, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_court_filings_2000/138/ Plaintiff's Motion for Substitution of Party], February 17, 2000; retrieved February 16, 2015.</ref>

By order of the court, Marilyn Sheppard's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]], in part to determine if the [[fetus]] she was carrying had been fathered by Sheppard. Terry Gilbert, an [[Lawyer|attorney]] retained by the Sheppard family, told the media that \"the [[fetus]] in this case had previously been [[autopsy|autopsied]]\", a fact that had never previously been disclosed. This, Gilbert argued, raised questions about the coroner's office in the original case possibly concealing pertinent evidence.<ref name=cnn/> Due to the passage of time and the effect of [[formaldehyde]] on the fetus's tissues, paternity could not be established.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Richard Eberling===
During the civil trial, plaintiff attorney Terry Gilbert contended that Richard Eberling, an occasional handyman and window washer at the Sheppard home, was the likeliest suspect in Marilyn's murder. Eberling found Marilyn attractive and he was very familiar with the layout of the Sheppard home.<ref>Linder, Douglas O., [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/sheppard/eberlinginfo.html “Dr. Sam Sheppard Trials”], University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref>

In 1959, detectives were questioning Richard Eberling on various burglaries in the area. Eberling confessed to the burglaries and showed the detectives his loot, which included two rings that belonged to Marilyn Sheppard. Eberling stole the rings in 1958, a few years after the murder, from Sam Sheppard's brother's house, taken from a box marked \"Personal Property of Marilyn Sheppard\".<ref>Cleveland Police Department, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/plaintiff_exhibits_2000/113 \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 0022: Eberling Statement\" (1959)], Sheppard 2000 Trial Plaintiff's Exhibits. Book 113.</ref> In subsequent questioning, Eberling admitted his blood was at the crime scene of Marilyn Sheppard. He stated that he cut his finger while washing windows just prior to the murder and bled while on the premises.<ref>Tompkins, James R., \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 0020: Bay Village Police Report re: Eberling\" (1988). Sheppard 2000 Trial Plaintiff's Exhibits. Book 114. http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/plaintiff_exhibits_2000/114</ref> As part of the investigation, Eberling took a polygraph test with questions about the murder of Marilyn. The polygraph examiner concluded that Eberling did not show deception in his answers, although the polygraph results were evaluated by other experts years later who found that it was either inconclusive or Eberling was deceptive.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 212, 352</ref>

In his testimony in the 2000 civil lawsuit, Bailey stated that he rejected Eberling as a suspect in 1966 because \"I thought he passed a good polygraph test.\" When it was presented to Bailey that an independent polygraph expert said Eberling either murdered Marilyn or had knowledge of who did, Bailey stated that he probably would have presented Eberling as a suspect in the 1966 retrial.<ref>Neff 2001, pp. 351-52</ref>

[[DNA]] evidence, which was not available in the two murder trials, played an important role in the civil trial. DNA analysis of blood at the crime scene showed that there was presence of blood from a third person, other than Marilyn and Dr. Sam Sheppard.<ref>Chakarborty, Ranajit, [http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_dna/17 \"Chakraborty Report on DNA Typing Involving Richard Eberling, Sam Sheppard, and Marilyn Sheppard\" (2000)],. Blood Evidence and DNA – Sam Sheppard Case. Book 17.</ref>

With regard to tying the blood to Eberling, the DNA analysis that was allowed to be admitted to the trial was inconclusive. A plaintiff DNA expert was 90% confident that one of the blood spots belonged to Richard Eberling but, according to the rules of the court, this was not admissible. The defense argued that the blood evidence had been tainted in the years since it was collected, and that an important blood spot on the closet door in Marilyn Sheppard's room potentially included 83% of the adult white population. The defense also pointed out that the results in 1955 from the older blood typing technique, that the blood collected from the closet door was Type O, while Eberling's [[ABO blood group system|blood type]] was Type A.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 364-367</ref>

Throughout his life, Richard Eberling was associated with women who had suspicious deaths and he was convicted of murdering Ethel May Durkin, a wealthy, elderly widow who died without any immediate family. Durkin's 1984 murder in [[Lakewood, Ohio]], was uncovered when a court-appointed review of the woman's estate revealed that Eberling, Durkin's guardian and executor, had failed to execute her final wishes, which included stipulations on her burial.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Durkin's body was exhumed and additional injuries were discovered in the autopsy that did not match Eberling's previous claims of in-house accidents, including a fall down a staircase in her home.  In subsequent legal action, both Eberling and his partner, Obie Henderson, were found guilty in Durkin's death. Coincidentally, both of Durkin's sisters, Myrtle Fray and Sarah Belle Farrow, had died under suspicious circumstances as well. Fray was killed after being \"savagely\" beaten about the head and face and then strangled; Farrow died following a fall down the basement steps in the home she shared with Durkin in 1970, a fall in which she broke both legs and both arms.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Although Eberling denied any criminal involvement in the murder of Marilyn Sheppard,<ref>[http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/famouspeople/a/sheppard.htm Sam Sheppard Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917234853/http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/famouspeople/a/sheppard.htm |date=September 17, 2005 }}, columbusoh.about.com; accessed April 29, 2017.</ref> Kathy Wagner Dyal, who worked alongside Eberling in caring for Ethel May Durkin, also testified that Eberling had confessed to her in 1983.<ref>Neff 2001, p. 298</ref> A fellow convict also reported that Eberling confessed to the crime. The defense called into question the credibility of both witnesses during the 2000 civil trial. Eberling died in an Ohio prison in 1998, where he was serving a [[life sentence]] for the 1984 murder of Ethel May Durkin.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Defense===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Steve Dever led the defense trial team for the State of Ohio, which included assistant prosecutors Dean Maynard Boland and Kathleen Martin. They argued that Sheppard was the most logical suspect, and presented expert testimony suggesting that Marilyn Sheppard's murder was a textbook domestic [[homicide]]. They argued that Sheppard had not welcomed the news of his wife's pregnancy, he wanted to continue his affairs with Susan Hayes and with other women, and he was concerned about the [[social stigma]] that a divorce might create.  They claimed the evidence showed that Marilyn Sheppard may have hit Sam Sheppard, sparking an angry rage that resulted in her bludgeoning. Boland evaluated evidence that had been considered by fifty years of investigators, journalists and others, and during the trial he was the first to suggest that the murder weapon used by Sam Sheppard was a bedroom lamp.

The defense asked why Sheppard had not called out for help, why he had neatly folded his jacket on the daybed in which he said he had fallen asleep, and why the family dog, which several witnesses had testified (in the first trial in 1954) was very loud when strangers came to the house, had not barked on the night of the murder (implying that the dog knew the killer).

===Verdict===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
After ten weeks of trial, 76 witnesses, and hundreds of exhibits, the case went to the eight-person civil jury. The jury deliberated just three hours on April 12, 2000, before returning a unanimous [[verdict]] that Samuel Reese Sheppard had failed to prove that his father had been wrongfully imprisoned.

===Invalidation of wrongful imprisonment claim===
On February 22, 2002, the [[Ohio District Courts of Appeals|Eighth District Court of Appeals]] ruled unanimously that the civil case should not have gone to the jury, on the grounds that the [[statute of limitations]] had expired, and that a claim for wrongful imprisonment abated with Sam Sheppard's death.<ref>''[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/sheppard_court_filings_2000/2 Murray v.

On 2 May 2016, it was announced that Sidwell had returned to the role. Steven made his return on 27 May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a795763/eastenders-steven-beale-aaron-sidwell-explains-return/ | title=EastEnders: Find out why Steven Beale is back| date=2016-05-27}}</ref> On 9 August 2017, it was announced that Sidwell would leave the show again. Steven made his final exit on 8 September 2017 when the character was killed off during a high-profile stunt week.

In the 1990s, Steven's storylines mostly concerned his paternity and the ongoing [[custody battle]] between his mother, [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]), and his stepfather, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). In the early 2000s, a darker side to adolescent Steven emerged as he began writing [[poison pen]] letters to neighbours, before moving to New Zealand to be with his father. In the late 2000s, Steven's storyline focused on his hostile relationship with Ian, and involved stalking Ian, taking Ian hostage, multiple [[suicide]] attempts, and accidentally shooting Ian's new wife, [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]). Steven also dates [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) but struggles with his sexuality and an attraction to Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), and he attempts to murder his grandmother, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Since his 2016 return, Steven becomes deceitful with his girlfriend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) by having an affair with her sister [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) - which sparks the events of the character being responsible for Abi's pregnancy; fabricating a lie about having a brain tumour; and nearly killing Jane again after Lauren and Abi's father, [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]), blackmails him in setting fire to the restaurant in his plan to kill her as revenge for her contribution to getting him wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of half-sister [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), who was previously killed by their stepbrother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Eliot Carrington). Ultimately, Steve contemplates on rescuing Jane and ends up getting injured in the fire by Max - which consequently triggers the character suffering a fatal cardiac arrest in hospital; Steve dies and his lies are soon discovered at his funeral a week later.

==Storylines==
=== 1989–2002 ===
Steven is born in December 1989; his mother is [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) and his father is [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]) - even though Cindy is married to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]); she goes as far as to convince Ian that he is Steven's father. Simon becomes Steven's godfather, despite knowing that he is his biological father. Cindy tells Ian the truth when she and Simon reconcile. They leave Walford with Steven in December 1990; however, Ian and Cindy reconcile in 1992, and Ian raises Steven as his son. In December 1993, Steven becomes a half-brother when his sister [[Lucy Beale]] and brother [[Peter Beale]] are born to Ian and Cindy. Unhappy in her marriage, Cindy hires a hitman to kill Ian in 1996, and when this fails, she snatches Steven and Peter and flees to [[Italy]]. In 1997, Ian tracks her, Steven and Peter down and kidnaps them back. Cindy fights for custody and wins, but on the day she reclaims Steven, Lucy and Peter, she is arrested when the hitman confesses to the attempted murder of Ian and Ian gains custody of Steven, Lucy and Peter. She dies in childbirth in prison in November 1998. Steven alone attends her funeral.

Steven then grows up with various different stepmothers, and though he grows close to them all, he feels abandoned when they leave. When Ian prepares to marry [[Laura Dunn]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]), Steven is anxious that they too will end up splitting; his fears are realised when he catches Ian kissing  [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) in 2002. From being a quiet, sensitive boy, Steven starts rebelling and skipping school. When Laura finds out, she confronts Steven, who reveals that Ian had kissed Janine. The subsequent rows have a negative effect on Steven; he becomes angry with the world and starts writing poison pen letters to people. Ian eventually finds out and confronts Steven. Following an argument, Steven goes to his room and overhears Ian calling him \"Cindy's little brat!\"; Ian is forced to tell Steven that he is not his natural father. Distressed and angry, Steven decides to leave Walford to meet Simon, who lives in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.

=== 2007–2008 ===
In September 2007, Steven returns and begins stalking Ian, pretending to be Ian's late wife, Cindy. He lures Ian to an empty block of flats, and takes him hostage. Arriving back in Walford, he spends time reminiscing with Peter and Lucy, though Ian's new wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) is initially wary of him, especially when he attempts to kiss her. When Steven's grandmother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) tells him that Ian always considers Steven his first born, blood related or not, Steven starts to regret what he has done. Wanting to confide in his sister, Steven takes Lucy to the flat where Ian is being held. Horrified, Lucy escapes and contacts Jane, while Ian confronts Steven about the reasons for his actions. Steven tells Ian that he blames him for his mother's imprisonment and death. He is angry that Ian had not retrieved him from New Zealand; living with his biological father had not been a happy experience, and he had ended up feeling rejected and in the way.

Steven then tries to commit suicide with a gun that Lucy gives him to dispose of. Ian, Jane and Lucy try to stop him, a struggle ensues, and Jane is accidentally shot in the stomach; as a result, she is unable to have children. Ian admits Steven to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When released, Steven goes off his medication. He tries to apologise to Jane and Ian, but finds them hostile. Hoping he will leave Walford, Ian humiliates and rejects Steven several times, going as far as to break a snow globe he had given to Steven when he was young right in front of him. Once again depressed, Steven tries to commit suicide by dousing himself in petrol; however, [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) stops him from setting fire to himself. When Ian discovers what Steven has been planning to do, he reconciles with him. Displeased, Jane fights against Steven being part of her family, but eventually relents and in January 2008, she agrees to let Steven move into the Beales' home; however, she makes it clear that she is waiting for him to mess up so he will be gone from her life for good.

Steven and Stacey grow closer in early 2008, as he supports her through the breakdown of her marriage. Steven is attracted to Stacey. She initially rejects his advances, but eventually agrees to date him. Their relationship progresses, until Steven decides that he is ready to lose his virginity, but their attempt at consummation ends in disaster when Steven can not perform sexually. Embarrassed, Steven pretends that he had lost his virginity; however, Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) realises he is lying and publicly announces it, leaving Steven humiliated. Steven confronts Christian and, after releasing his pent-up anger and frustration, he spontaneously kisses Christian. Realising Steven is gay, Christian tries to make Steven face up to his sexuality. Steven maintains that he is heterosexual, and successfully has sex with Stacey, but their relationship soon ends when Christian tells Stacey that Steven had kissed him.

Distraught, Steven propositions Christian, but is rejected. In revenge, Steven tells Ian that Christian had tried to seduce him. Ian is furious until Jane discovers the truth, leading Steven to confess that he is gay. Steven is grateful when Ian proves supportive, as his biological father had not been. Ian is full of praise for Steven; however, he does not realise that Steven has been hiding his runaway daughter, Lucy. Steven does not want to share Ian's attention, so he makes plans for Lucy to flee to France; however, Pat discovers his plan and is hit by a car as she is trying to apprehend him. Pat is hospitalised, and in order to stop her from telling Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to smother her with a pillow. Pat wakes up, but Steven continues in his murder attempt until Ian interrupts him. When Pat tells Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to deny it, but Ian sees through his lies. He traces Steven to [[St Pancras railway station]], and discovers him with Lucy. Steven has booked her a ticket on the [[Eurostar]], but Ian persuades her not to go and Steven flees. Later, back in Walford, Ian spots Steven spying on Lucy. Ian confronts him, admitting that he is glad that Steven is not his biological son; he tells him that if he ever returns to Albert Square, he will kill him. Devastated, Steven heads to the tube station and leaves Walford. In 2014, Peter reveals that Steven was living in New Zealand with his father, Simon. Peter (now [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) and fiancée [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) leave Walford for New Zealand to join Steven in February 2015.

=== 2016–2017 ===
In May 2016, Steven returns with Lauren and [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie|Louie]] after they learn that Jane is in hospital after being attacked by [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington), who also confessed to killing Lucy. Ian initially rejects Steven, but Steven says he is back to help and repair any damage he made in the past. Ian accepts Steven's offer of driving him to the hospital. Steven and Lauren do not tell anyone that they are together but when Ian finds out, he throws them out. Ian eventually accepts Steven back into the family but Jane is wary of him. Steven helps Ian at his restaurant and impresses him with his sales skills. Sadly, Jane soon finds an unfinished credit card application in Lucy's name and accuses Steven. Steven admits being responsible because he realised Ian is struggling financially. Ian promotes Steven to restaurant manager. When the restaurant is burgled, it is revealed that Steven arranged it and sold the kitchen equipment to pay debts. [[Kyle Slater]] ([[Riley Carter Millington]]), an employee at the restaurant, realises Steven arranged the burglary, so Steven sends him on a training course, and he admits to Lauren what he did. Later, Kyle asks Steven for a pay rise, saying he has kept quiet about the burglary, but Steven refuses.

Steven worries when Jane asks to look at the restaurant's accounts as he has stolen money. He makes excuses not to let her use the restaurant's laptop and tells Lauren he will fake some invoices. Steven is overjoyed when Louie says his first word, \"mama\", and gets him to say \"dada\", filming it to show Lauren. However, she sends the video to Peter, upsetting Steven as he tells Lauren that he sees himself as Louie's father but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. Steven also worries that Lauren never says she loves him when he says it to her. When Jane looks at the restaurant's accounts and realizes payments are being made to a fake company, she knows it can only be Ian or Steven but worries about confronting the wrong person. She soon discovers that Steven set up the fake company and confronts him; he explains he borrowed the money to help Peter, who was drinking heavily and getting into fights and Lauren does not know the whole truth, so Jane tells him to be honest with her. She is angry that Steven was not honest and considers visiting Peter; Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake.

Lauren meets [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]), a man who works in her father [[Max Branning]]'s ([[Jake Wood]]) office, and they are attracted to each other. Josh encourages Lauren to apply for a job there but Steven is unimpressed by Lauren's plans as he wants her to spend more time with him and Louie. He suggests that they start trying for a baby but Lauren refuses because she wants to concentrate on her career, so Steven secretly pieces holes in condoms. Lauren gets a job at the company and tells Steven that she barely sees Josh but Steven visits her at work and sees her with Josh, and he becomes suspicious. Steven is unaware that Lauren is pregnant and planning an abortion, although her sister [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) makes him question Lauren and Josh's relationship. During an argument with Abi, who resents Lauren, Steven is stunned to hear Lauren aborted his child. A few days later, following Abi's 21st birthday party, another disagreement between Abi and Steven ends with them sleeping together. Some time after, Steven has sex with Abi again after seeing footage of Lauren and Josh. Despite the affair with Abi, Steven insists he wants to be with Lauren and Abi does her best to poison his mind against her. When Lauren tells Josh that she doesn't love Steven, Abi persuades her to return to New Zealand. Just as she is about to leave, Josh visits Steven and tells him that Lauren has resigned from her job. Steven bashes his head against the wall, causing it to bleed. He later bumps into Lauren before she leaves and she plans to end their relationship, but notices Steven's head injury. In a desperate act to keep Lauren with him, Steven lies the injury is caused by him trying to remove a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]], claiming that he has [[cancer]] and he is dying.

Although Abi discovers the truth, she decides not to tell Lauren after Steven tells her he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. However, Steven tells Lauren he wants to adopt Louie and stuns Abi by proposing marriage to Lauren in The Queen Vic. When Lauren leaves Walford to visit Tanya, conflicted on her relationship with Steven, Max tells him he knows he lied about the brain tumour and gives him an ultimatum: help him move some clients from his property or he will tell Lauren the truth. Max tells Steven to set fire to the flat while making sure the clients safely exit the premises. Steven refuses and tells Max that he will tell Lauren the truth when she returns and tells Abi that their affair was a mistake. However, when Lauren texts to say that she will be staying with Tanya for longer, Steven agrees to Max's plan. However, the plan appears to backfire when the residents hear sirens of fire engines, police cars and ambulances. Max finds Steven in The Vic alleyway and Steven tells him he does not know if the clients exited the flat. Max tells Steven that he is on his own as he drove Ian's car to the flat, while dismissing Steven's claim that if he goes to prison, Max will go down too. Max tells him to find an alibi, so Steven asks Abi. Steven tells Max that he has an alibi and mentions that the clients did exit the flat. Jane later discovers Max's revenge plan and Steven's brain tumour lie and Max convinces Steven that Jane is trying to get rid of him. Steven confronts Jane and blames her for Max's behaviour, but Jane tries to reason with Steven and reveals Abi is pregnant. However, Steven refuses to believe her, and after berating her about framing Max for Lucy's murder, sets fire to the restaurant, and leaves Jane to perish in the flames. Believing Lauren trapped inside, Steven and Max run back into the inferno and Steven saves Abi, who became trapped upon finding, and attempting to save Jane. Max tried to get Steven to kill Jane but he refuses and tries to save her. Max violently shoves him into a countertop, causing Steven to be rushed to hospital where he tells Abi that he loves her and will try to make their relationship work. He then suffers a [[cardiac arrest]] and dies from his injuries. When Steven's lies are revealed, it is also revealed that Steven died of injuries to the liver (likely from when Max pushed him) and so only Abi attends his funeral and reads a eulogy dedicated to him. Abi then has Steven cremated and hides his ashes away from Lauren when they visit their mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) in Exeter. However, Lauren eventually discovers the truth after finding Abi in her wedding dress. Horrified by what she has learned, Lauren tries to flush Steven's ashes down the toilet, but Abi stops her, eventually telling her the truth about her pregnancy with his baby. In December 2017, Abi and Lauren learn about their father's scheme before discovering his knowledge over the former's pregnancy with Steven's baby. They eventually find out on Christmas that year the truth about Steven's death when their mother [[Tanya Branning|Tanya]] reveals that Max killed him – causing them to disown their father, who subsequently gets into a fight with Ian when he and his mother [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] learn the truth as well; the latter then explains this to Phil, who then confronts and attacks Max. Shortly afterwards, Abi and Lauren fall from the Queen Vic roof; both survive and are taken to hospital, where an ultrasound shows Abi and Steven's baby is alive. Fearing that Abi may go into cardiac arrest following her devastating diagnosis of brain stem death, the doctors decide to deliver the baby via cesarean section. Soon after, the doctors switch off Abi's life support when it becomes clear that the chances of reviving her are impossible.

A year later, many people blamed Bobby for Max's revenge including the deaths of Steven and his own daughter Abi.

==Creation and development==
===Early storylines===
The character's conception was a part of one of the most notable storylines in ''EastEnders'' during 1989, a love triangle between [[Cindy Beale|Cindy Williams]] (played by [[Michelle Collins]]), [[Simon Wicks]] (played by [[Nick Berry]]) and [[Ian Beale]] (played by [[Adam Woodyatt]]).<ref name=\"10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Steven was the result of a [[one-night stand]] (in the bar of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]) between Cindy and Simon, occurring while Cindy was engaged to Ian Beale in May 1989. Viewers knew that Cindy was carrying Simon's child; however, between characters in the serial, Steven's true paternity was kept secret, with only Cindy, Simon, and later Simon's mother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) knowing the truth, though neither Simon or Pat would believe Cindy's claim initially. Simon's rejection of Cindy and her unborn child facilitated a plot twist that saw Cindy pretend that the child was Ian's.

The character's birth occurred in an episode that aired on 28 December 1989, although in the on-screen events, he was born on [[Boxing Day]]. In the storyline, Steven was born two months prematurely, and was therefore supposed to be small; however, the baby who originally played Steven, Edward Farrell, was actually large for his age, and was nicknamed \"Chunky\" by actor Adam Woodyatt.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=9780563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> According to former ''EastEnders'' writer, [[David Yallop]], it had been agreed in September 1989, that Steven Beale would be killed off in the serial. This was part of producer [[Mike Gibbon]]'s plan to increase the ratings by culling a large number of the soap's long-running cast. Yallop said, \"We had to reach a decision with the illegitimate child who was in the process of being born as a result of an earlier storyline. We wanted to know what to do with it. Either the child would be allowed to live or it would die. They decided to make the child 'seriously ill', but the reprieve was temporary. In episode 606 I resolved the problem.\" He claimed that on his draft of the storyline he wrote the words \"Baby die\". The plot never came to fruition, as Gibbon was abruptly replaced as the soap's boss and Yallop's plots were scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/soap-operas-producers-aimed-axe-at-poor-acting-1556027.html|title=Soap opera's producers 'aimed axe at poor acting' |newspaper=The Independent| date = 8 October 1992|accessdate=19 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

According to the ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Handbook]]'' by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for roles in ''EastEnders'' is usually done locally, so that children and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> This occurred with Steven's original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. The baby had been scripted to appear at a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: \"Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. I had to keep pushing her hair back under her hat but lots of [viewers] still spotted it\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven's christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, \"When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn’t recover and I kissed him for it.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>

Before his first screen birthday, Steven was central to storylines surrounding his parents and stepfather Ian, including a special week of off-set episodes filmed in Devon, where Ian discovered that his best friend Simon was Steven's real father and that he had reunited with Cindy. The love triangle between Simon, Cindy and Ian, and the events surrounding Steven's paternity dominated the soap during 1990; it has been described by writer [[Colin Brake]] as the year's \"big story\".<ref name=\"10years\"/> Steven was written out of the serial after actors Nick Berry and Michelle Collins decided to leave the show. His exit aired on 27 December 1990, though in the on-screen events it was Boxing Day, Steven's first birthday. In 1992, Michelle Collins reprised her role of Cindy, and Steven was also reintroduced, played by a different actor, Stuart Stevens. On-screen, Simon abandoned Cindy and Steven. Ian traced them to a bedsit and brought them back to Walford, where Steven was brought up as Ian's real son. Steven was written out once again in 1996, when Collins quit for a second time. In the on-screen events, Cindy absconded with Steven and his brother [[Peter Beale|Peter]] following Cindy's failed attempt to have Ian assassinated. Upon his return in 1997 – where Ian once again regained custody – Steven's role was recast to another actor, [[Edward Savage (footballer)|Edward Savage]]. As the character aged, his actor was given a more substantial role in the serial, Steven remaining with Ian following the death of his mother, who died in prison during child birth. Savage remained in the role until 2002, when he opted to leave. On-screen, Steven discovered that Ian had been lying about his paternity. He began rebelling, and was found to be the author of several mysterious poison pen letters. When he was caught, he demanded to travel to New Zealand, so he could meet his real father, Simon Wicks. A BBC source commented to the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', \"Regular viewers will know Steven is a deeply troubled boy. But his unmasking as the poison pen author is going to shock everyone on the Square. The lad is almost inviting punishment. It's as if he wants Ian and [his stepmother] [[Laura Beale|Laura]] to wash their hands of him. Could Steven be a new [[Nick Cotton]] in the making?\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a9530/writer-of-eastenders-poison-pen-letters-revealed.html|title= Writer of 'EastEnders' poison pen letters revealed|website=[[Digital Spy]] | author=Neil Wilkes| date = 6 November 2002| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>

===Reintroduction (2007); stalking, kidnapping and mental illness===
In 2005, the British media claimed that the character of Steven was due to return to ''EastEnders'', three years after he had last appeared. The ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' speculated that ''EastEnders'' bosses were hoping to cast an Australian actor to play Steven, to signify that he had been in New Zealand. It was claimed that actors from Australia's long-running soaps, ''[[Neighbours]]'' or ''[[Home and Away]]'', were being considered.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a19045/eastenders-return-for-kathy-beale.html|title= 'EastEnders' return for Kathy Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Daniel Kilkelly| date = 6 February 2005| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> The rumours turned out to be false, and a subsequent rumour in January 2007 predicting that ''[[Footballers' Wives]]''' actor [[Craig Gallivan]] was to play the role, was also quashed.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a42116/footie-wives-actor-tipped-as-new-steven-beale.html|title= Footie Wives actor tipped as new Steven Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Kris Green| date = 25 January 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>
[[File:Stevenbeale 2007.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Steven Beale as he appeared in 2007]]
The character was eventually to make his return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] as part of a storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured to the top of a deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/22/comment.tvandradioarts1|title= For whom the Beale tolls|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author= Anne Pickard | date = 22 September 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy.<ref name=\"ds\"/> [[Aaron Sidwell]] was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him. It was Sidwell's first television role, and he has described it as \"a bit daunting...but everyone was really welcoming...the first few directors I worked with were fantastic...After we did rehearsal, after we did a take, they'd always give me feedback...I needed it.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/ondemand/eastenders/av/characters_cast/interviews/aaron_interview?bgc=e3e1e1&nbram=1&lang=en&nbwm=1&bbram=1&ms3=6&ms_javascript=true&bbcws=1&size=16x9&bbwm=1|title= Interview Aaron Sidwell|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 19 September 2007|accessdate= 4 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He added, \"I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive. I still wake up and think: 'Oh my God, I'm in ''EastEnders''.' It's brilliant.\"<ref name=\"lucky\">{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a81753/walford-actor-feels-so-lucky.html|title= Walford actor feels \"so lucky\"|publisher=DS | author=  Daniel Kilkelly | date = 15 December 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said \"[Steven] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how he kind of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded... Steven is..a messed up kid and when I first got the part I was given a catchphrase that describes him as a person...'look at me'...he wants to be in the limelight 100%...he wants people to be thinking about him [all the time]...that's why he got angry with Ian because Ian wasn't thinking about him... he's the most important person in the world.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/>

The storyline eventually reached its climax in October 2007. Steven's games were uncovered, and during the confrontation that followed, Steven threatened to kill himself, but accidentally shot Ian's wife [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) and a resulting emergency hysterectomy meant that Jane could no longer have children of her own. The storyline has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist, Stephen Armstrong, as having \"a whiff of [[Brontë]] about it\", which producer Diederick Santer agreed with. Santer added, \"It's a classic madwoman in the attic story, but I hate those articles where someone who works in popular television says what they do is like [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]. It's about the balance. That story works because it has an old character whom the audience love – Ian Beale – as well as new characters who have an appeal for teenagers fresh to the show. Soap audiences like continuity. They dip in and out and if they haven't watched for a few weeks, then tune in to find no one they recognise, it can be disconcerting.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/08/mondaymediasection12|title= The art of storytelling|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author=  Stephen Armstrong| date = 8 October 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

Mentally ill, Steven was admitted to a psychiatric hospital by Ian. Sidwell has commented on Steven's mental instability: \"He's so unpredictable...you never know what he's going to do next...He'll be normal one minute and he'll be crazy the next. He's kind of the [[Donnie Darko (character)|Donnie Darko]] of ''EastEnders''...that's the kind of person I styled him after...[he is] a similar character...He is always going to be a bit unstable and there will always be danger. I don't think even he knows what he's going to do next – but he's deadly, so don't let the nice guy act fool you.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/><ref name=\"lucky\"/>

Steven returned to the serial as a regular character following his release from hospital. Subsequent plots saw him unsuccessfully attempting to make amends with Ian and Jane for his past wrongdoing. The character also formed a friendship with [[Stacey Slater]] (played by [[Lacey Turner]]), who stopped him from committing suicide in December 2007. In the on-screen events, Steven – infuriated by Ian's rejection – soaked himself with petrol and threatened to light himself on fire. In the end, Stacey managed to persuade him not to go through with suicide by showing him that friends can be just as important as family. Despite hostilities from Jane, Steven gradually regained Ian's trust, and in episodes that aired over the Christmas period of 2007, Ian welcomed Steven back into his home as part of the Beale family.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Departure (2008); sexuality and Lucy's disappearance===
In February 2008, the BBC announced that Steven was being written out of ''EastEnders'' once again.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20080222_n2.shtml|title= Steven's farewell|publisher=BBC | date = 22 February 2008| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> An ''EastEnders'' spokeswoman revealed: \"[Sidwell]'s contract has run out – he only came for that length of contract. But his character came in dramatically and he'll go out dramatically.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=244367&command=displayContent&sourceNode=244365&contentPK=19957771&folderPk=112383&pNodeId=188965 |title=Aaron to leave EastEnders |publisher=This is Nottingham |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=4 March 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>

The buildup to Steven's exit involved in a [[bisexual]] [[love triangle]] storyline between him, Stacey and [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), who is the [[homosexuality|gay]] brother of Jane.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.myparkmag.co.uk/articles/television/eastenders/eastenders-aaron-sidwell-has-been-axed.html|title=EastEnders – Aaron Sidwell has been axed|publisher=My Park|date=22 February 2008|accessdate=9 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-6950.html|title=EastEnders bisexual story in pictures

Steven later decided he was ready to lose his virginity to Stacey, and took Ian's advice \"to try to name the England football team and substitutes as a technique for pacing himself,\"<ref name=\"virginity\">{{Cite news|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|author-link=|date=8 April 2008|year=|title=A piece of the action|periodical=[[Inside Soap]]|location=[[England]]|place=|publisher=|volume=|issue=|pages=26–7|url=|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> which Sidwell has described as, \"a really funny scene to film [...] my favourite comedy moment since joining the show.\"<ref name=\"virginity\"/> 

Speaking of the character's impending exit, he added: \"Steven loves Stacey as a friend, and would do anything for her. He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality...\"<ref name=\"virginity\" /> On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; in an interview with the ''Daily Star'' he explained, \"[Lacey Turner's] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [John Partridge] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. [The gay kiss] is a cracking scene and I'm really pleased with it.\"<ref>\"[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a94685/enders-star-found-gay-kiss-challenging.html 'Enders star found gay kiss 'challenging'], ''Digital Spy''. URL last accessed 26 April 2008.</ref> The storyline progressed with Steven denying his homosexual tendencies, leading Christian to continuously try and \"[[outing|out]]\" him. John Partridge, has commented, \"Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man – and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's nothing you can do about it and if you try to hide it, people get hurt.\"<ref name=\"chris\">{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/3180|title=Can Christian help troubled Steven?|newspaper=[[What's on TV]]|date=21 April 2008|accessdate=26 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001085312/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/3180|archivedate=1 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him, as a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales' lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out, and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot was described as \"controversial\", and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: \"A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well.\"<ref name=\"chris\" />

A final twist in Steven's story was his involvement in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy ([[Melissa Suffield]]). In episodes that aired in May 2008, it was revealed that Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. 

Explaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, \"It's all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian's love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She's the one who gets most of Ian's time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He's been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn’t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian’s life for good [...] He craves Ian’s full attention and is willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen. He doesn’t exactly plan to be evil but he is dangerous.\"<ref name=\"lucy\">{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3231|title=Steven plots to get Ian all to himself!|newspaper=[[What's on TV]]|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=20 May 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001085438/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3231|archivedate=1 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the end Steven's plan was discovered by his grandmother Pat, leading Steven to attempt to suffocate her to death before she revealed the truth to Ian. An ''EastEnders'' source told ''Digital Spy'': \"Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian. He goes from confused to psycho in a matter of minutes, grabbing a pillow and pushing it onto her face.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a94735/psycho-steven-attempts-murder-in-enders.html|title=Psycho Steven attempts murder in 'Enders|website=[[Digital Spy]] | date = 28 May 2008| accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref> Sidwell added, \"Steven is deadly! He is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants  including murder.\" 

The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the [[Eurostar]] to [[Paris]]) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, \"Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees to go home with Ian.\"<ref name=\"lucy\" /> Steven then departed from Walford after Ian vowed to kill him if he ever saw him again.<ref name=\"pancras\">{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/tv/soapbox/2008/05/04/steven-s-hit-and-run-89520-20403216/|title=Steven's hit and Run|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=20 May 2008}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Sidwell made his last appearance on-screen as Steven on 9 May 2008, and he has since revealed that producers made the right decision in axing his character as his story arc had run its course: \"They really did try to keep Steven in. The problem is ''EastEnders'' is a realistic show, so with Steven being a larger-than-life character it was always going to be hard having him doing the same crazy things day in, day out. I wasn't expecting to stay on the Square forever. It was my first big job out of drama college and I couldn't have asked for a better start in the industry. I've had a great time and the character isn't being killed off, so who knows what might happen a few years down the line. There's always the possibility I might be asked back one day\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a94731/enders-star-sidwell-backs-axing-decision.html|title='Enders star Sidwell backs axing decision|newspaper=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] | date = 27 April 2008| accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref>

Sidwell said of his return, \"I was happy to be asked back, it was the right time for me and the right time for the character.

== Reception ==
The ''[[Daily Mirror|Mirror]]'''s Tony Stewart commented that \"With the exception of [''[[Coronation Street]]'s'' [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]]], no psycho kid has inflicted so much damage on his own family as deranged freak Steven Beale.\"<ref name=\"pancras\"/> He described Steven's exit storyline as sinister, exciting and compelling drama, adding  that it was \"sometimes hilarious and never less than thrilling\".<ref name=\"pancras\"/>

Discussing the character's mental problems and his sexuality, Gareth McLean of ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressed concern that \"in 'EastEnders', being gay is akin to being mentally unbalanced.  Were Steven Beale's behaviour up until now not a cause for concern – kidnapping Ian, shooting Jane, spiriting Lucy away to a caravan to play with her mind – wait until he attempts to murder his granny.

'''Steven Beale''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by Edward Farrell from 1989 to 1990,<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Stuart Stevens from 1992 to 1998, [[Edward Savage (footballer)|Edward Savage]] from 1998 to 2002, and [[Aaron Sidwell]] from 2007 to 2017.<ref name=\"ds\">{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a76233/first-look-steven-beale-walks-back-into-walford.html |title= Steven Beale walks back into Walford |website=[[Digital Spy]]  | date = 24 September 2007| accessdate=24 September 2007}}</ref> It was announced on 22 February 2008 that the character would be written out at the end of Sidwell's contract, and made his on-screen departure on 9 May 2008. On 2 May 2016, it was announced that Sidwell had returned to the role. Steven made his return on 27 May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a795763/eastenders-steven-beale-aaron-sidwell-explains-return/ | title=EastEnders: Find out why Steven Beale is back| date=2016-05-27}}</ref> On 9 August 2017, it was announced that Sidwell would leave the show again. Steven made his final exit on 8 September 2017 when the character was killed off during a high-profile stunt week.

In the 1990s, Steven's storylines mostly concerned his paternity and the ongoing [[custody battle]] between his mother, [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]), and his stepfather, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). In the early 2000s, a darker side to adolescent Steven emerged as he began writing [[poison pen]] letters to neighbours, before moving to New Zealand to be with his father. In the late 2000s, Steven's storyline focused on his hostile relationship with Ian, and involved stalking Ian, taking Ian hostage, multiple [[suicide]] attempts, and accidentally shooting Ian's new wife, [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]). Steven also dates [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) but struggles with his sexuality and an attraction to Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), and he attempts to murder his grandmother, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Since his 2016 return, Steven becomes deceitful with his girlfriend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) by having an affair with her sister [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) - which sparks the events of the character being responsible for Abi's pregnancy; fabricating a lie about having a brain tumour; and nearly killing Jane again after Lauren and Abi's father, [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]), blackmails him in setting fire to the restaurant in his plan to kill her as revenge for her contribution to getting him wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of half-sister [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), who was previously killed by their stepbrother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Eliot Carrington). Ultimately, Steve contemplates on rescuing Jane and ends up getting injured in the fire by Max - which consequently triggers the character suffering a fatal cardiac arrest in hospital; Steve dies and his lies are soon discovered at his funeral a week later.

==Storylines==
=== 1989–2002 ===
Steven is born in December 1989; his mother is [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) and his father is [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]) - even though Cindy is married to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]); she goes as far as to convince Ian that he is Steven's father. Simon becomes Steven's godfather, despite knowing that he is his biological father. Cindy tells Ian the truth when she and Simon reconcile. They leave Walford with Steven in December 1990; however, Ian and Cindy reconcile in 1992, and Ian raises Steven as his son. In December 1993, Steven becomes a half-brother when his sister [[Lucy Beale]] and brother [[Peter Beale]] are born to Ian and Cindy. Unhappy in her marriage, Cindy hires a hitman to kill Ian in 1996, and when this fails, she snatches Steven and Peter and flees to [[Italy]]. In 1997, Ian tracks her, Steven and Peter down and kidnaps them back. Cindy fights for custody and wins, but on the day she reclaims Steven, Lucy and Peter, she is arrested when the hitman confesses to the attempted murder of Ian and Ian gains custody of Steven, Lucy and Peter. She dies in childbirth in prison in November 1998. Steven alone attends her funeral.

Steven then grows up with various different stepmothers, and though he grows close to them all, he feels abandoned when they leave. When Ian prepares to marry [[Laura Dunn]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]), Steven is anxious that they too will end up splitting; his fears are realised when he catches Ian kissing  [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) in 2002. From being a quiet, sensitive boy, Steven starts rebelling and skipping school. When Laura finds out, she confronts Steven, who reveals that Ian had kissed Janine. The subsequent rows have a negative effect on Steven; he becomes angry with the world and starts writing poison pen letters to people. Ian eventually finds out and confronts Steven. Following an argument, Steven goes to his room and overhears Ian calling him \"Cindy's little brat!\"; Ian is forced to tell Steven that he is not his natural father. Distressed and angry, Steven decides to leave Walford to meet Simon, who lives in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.

=== 2007–2008 ===
In September 2007, Steven returns and begins stalking Ian, pretending to be Ian's late wife, Cindy. He lures Ian to an empty block of flats, and takes him hostage. Arriving back in Walford, he spends time reminiscing with Peter and Lucy, though Ian's new wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) is initially wary of him, especially when he attempts to kiss her. When Steven's grandmother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) tells him that Ian always considers Steven his first born, blood related or not, Steven starts to regret what he has done. Wanting to confide in his sister, Steven takes Lucy to the flat where Ian is being held. Horrified, Lucy escapes and contacts Jane, while Ian confronts Steven about the reasons for his actions. Steven tells Ian that he blames him for his mother's imprisonment and death. He is angry that Ian had not retrieved him from New Zealand; living with his biological father had not been a happy experience, and he had ended up feeling rejected and in the way.

Steven then tries to commit suicide with a gun that Lucy gives him to dispose of. Ian, Jane and Lucy try to stop him, a struggle ensues, and Jane is accidentally shot in the stomach; as a result, she is unable to have children. Ian admits Steven to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When released, Steven goes off his medication. He tries to apologise to Jane and Ian, but finds them hostile. Hoping he will leave Walford, Ian humiliates and rejects Steven several times, going as far as to break a snow globe he had given to Steven when he was young right in front of him. Once again depressed, Steven tries to commit suicide by dousing himself in petrol; however, [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) stops him from setting fire to himself. When Ian discovers what Steven has been planning to do, he reconciles with him. Displeased, Jane fights against Steven being part of her family, but eventually relents and in January 2008, she agrees to let Steven move into the Beales' home; however, she makes it clear that she is waiting for him to mess up so he will be gone from her life for good.

Steven and Stacey grow closer in early 2008, as he supports her through the breakdown of her marriage. Steven is attracted to Stacey. She initially rejects his advances, but eventually agrees to date him. Their relationship progresses, until Steven decides that he is ready to lose his virginity, but their attempt at consummation ends in disaster when Steven can not perform sexually. Embarrassed, Steven pretends that he had lost his virginity; however, Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) realises he is lying and publicly announces it, leaving Steven humiliated. Steven confronts Christian and, after releasing his pent-up anger and frustration, he spontaneously kisses Christian. Realising Steven is gay, Christian tries to make Steven face up to his sexuality. Steven maintains that he is heterosexual, and successfully has sex with Stacey, but their relationship soon ends when Christian tells Stacey that Steven had kissed him.

Distraught, Steven propositions Christian, but is rejected. In revenge, Steven tells Ian that Christian had tried to seduce him. Ian is furious until Jane discovers the truth, leading Steven to confess that he is gay. Steven is grateful when Ian proves supportive, as his biological father had not been. Ian is full of praise for Steven; however, he does not realise that Steven has been hiding his runaway daughter, Lucy. Steven does not want to share Ian's attention, so he makes plans for Lucy to flee to France; however, Pat discovers his plan and is hit by a car as she is trying to apprehend him. Pat is hospitalised, and in order to stop her from telling Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to smother her with a pillow. Pat wakes up, but Steven continues in his murder attempt until Ian interrupts him. When Pat tells Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to deny it, but Ian sees through his lies. He traces Steven to [[St Pancras railway station]], and discovers him with Lucy. Steven has booked her a ticket on the [[Eurostar]], but Ian persuades her not to go and Steven flees. Later, back in Walford, Ian spots Steven spying on Lucy. Ian confronts him, admitting that he is glad that Steven is not his biological son; he tells him that if he ever returns to Albert Square, he will kill him. Devastated, Steven heads to the tube station and leaves Walford. In 2014, Peter reveals that Steven was living in New Zealand with his father, Simon. Peter (now [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) and fiancée [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) leave Walford for New Zealand to join Steven in February 2015.

=== 2016–2017 ===
In May 2016, Steven returns with Lauren and [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie|Louie]] after they learn that Jane is in hospital after being attacked by [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington), who also confessed to killing Lucy. Ian initially rejects Steven, but Steven says he is back to help and repair any damage he made in the past. Ian accepts Steven's offer of driving him to the hospital. Steven and Lauren do not tell anyone that they are together but when Ian finds out, he throws them out. Ian eventually accepts Steven back into the family but Jane is wary of him. Steven helps Ian at his restaurant and impresses him with his sales skills. Sadly, Jane soon finds an unfinished credit card application in Lucy's name and accuses Steven. Steven admits being responsible because he realised Ian is struggling financially. Ian promotes Steven to restaurant manager. When the restaurant is burgled, it is revealed that Steven arranged it and sold the kitchen equipment to pay debts. [[Kyle Slater]] ([[Riley Carter Millington]]), an employee at the restaurant, realises Steven arranged the burglary, so Steven sends him on a training course, and he admits to Lauren what he did. Later, Kyle asks Steven for a pay rise, saying he has kept quiet about the burglary, but Steven refuses.

Steven worries when Jane asks to look at the restaurant's accounts as he has stolen money. He makes excuses not to let her use the restaurant's laptop and tells Lauren he will fake some invoices. Steven is overjoyed when Louie says his first word, \"mama\", and gets him to say \"dada\", filming it to show Lauren. However, she sends the video to Peter, upsetting Steven as he tells Lauren that he sees himself as Louie's father but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. Steven also worries that Lauren never says she loves him when he says it to her. When Jane looks at the restaurant's accounts and realizes payments are being made to a fake company, she knows it can only be Ian or Steven but worries about confronting the wrong person. She soon discovers that Steven set up the fake company and confronts him; he explains he borrowed the money to help Peter, who was drinking heavily and getting into fights and Lauren does not know the whole truth, so Jane tells him to be honest with her. She is angry that Steven was not honest and considers visiting Peter; Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake.

Lauren meets [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]), a man who works in her father [[Max Branning]]'s ([[Jake Wood]]) office, and they are attracted to each other. Josh encourages Lauren to apply for a job there but Steven is unimpressed by Lauren's plans as he wants her to spend more time with him and Louie. He suggests that they start trying for a baby but Lauren refuses because she wants to concentrate on her career, so Steven secretly pieces holes in condoms. Lauren gets a job at the company and tells Steven that she barely sees Josh but Steven visits her at work and sees her with Josh, and he becomes suspicious. Steven is unaware that Lauren is pregnant and planning an abortion, although her sister [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) makes him question Lauren and Josh's relationship. During an argument with Abi, who resents Lauren, Steven is stunned to hear Lauren aborted his child. A few days later, following Abi's 21st birthday party, another disagreement between Abi and Steven ends with them sleeping together. Some time after, Steven has sex with Abi again after seeing footage of Lauren and Josh. Despite the affair with Abi, Steven insists he wants to be with Lauren and Abi does her best to poison his mind against her. When Lauren tells Josh that she doesn't love Steven, Abi persuades her to return to New Zealand. Just as she is about to leave, Josh visits Steven and tells him that Lauren has resigned from her job. Steven bashes his head against the wall, causing it to bleed. He later bumps into Lauren before she leaves and she plans to end their relationship, but notices Steven's head injury. In a desperate act to keep Lauren with him, Steven lies the injury is caused by him trying to remove a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]], claiming that he has [[cancer]] and he is dying.

Although Abi discovers the truth, she decides not to tell Lauren after Steven tells her he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. However, Steven tells Lauren he wants to adopt Louie and stuns Abi by proposing marriage to Lauren in The Queen Vic. When Lauren leaves Walford to visit Tanya, conflicted on her relationship with Steven, Max tells him he knows he lied about the brain tumour and gives him an ultimatum: help him move some clients from his property or he will tell Lauren the truth. Max tells Steven to set fire to the flat while making sure the clients safely exit the premises. Steven refuses and tells Max that he will tell Lauren the truth when she returns and tells Abi that their affair was a mistake. However, when Lauren texts to say that she will be staying with Tanya for longer, Steven agrees to Max's plan. However, the plan appears to backfire when the residents hear sirens of fire engines, police cars and ambulances. Max finds Steven in The Vic alleyway and Steven tells him he does not know if the clients exited the flat. Max tells Steven that he is on his own as he drove Ian's car to the flat, while dismissing Steven's claim that if he goes to prison, Max will go down too. Max tells him to find an alibi, so Steven asks Abi. Steven tells Max that he has an alibi and mentions that the clients did exit the flat. Jane later discovers Max's revenge plan and Steven's brain tumour lie and Max convinces Steven that Jane is trying to get rid of him. Steven confronts Jane and blames her for Max's behaviour, but Jane tries to reason with Steven and reveals Abi is pregnant. However, Steven refuses to believe her, and after berating her about framing Max for Lucy's murder, sets fire to the restaurant, and leaves Jane to perish in the flames. Believing Lauren trapped inside, Steven and Max run back into the inferno and Steven saves Abi, who became trapped upon finding, and attempting to save Jane. Max tried to get Steven to kill Jane but he refuses and tries to save her. Max violently shoves him into a countertop, causing Steven to be rushed to hospital where he tells Abi that he loves her and will try to make their relationship work. He then suffers a [[cardiac arrest]] and dies from his injuries. When Steven's lies are revealed, it is also revealed that Steven died of injuries to the liver (likely from when Max pushed him) and so only Abi attends his funeral and reads a eulogy dedicated to him. Abi then has Steven cremated and hides his ashes away from Lauren when they visit their mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) in Exeter. However, Lauren eventually discovers the truth after finding Abi in her wedding dress. Horrified by what she has learned, Lauren tries to flush Steven's ashes down the toilet, but Abi stops her, eventually telling her the truth about her pregnancy with his baby. In December 2017, Abi and Lauren learn about their father's scheme before discovering his knowledge over the former's pregnancy with Steven's baby. They eventually find out on Christmas that year the truth about Steven's death when their mother [[Tanya Branning|Tanya]] reveals that Max killed him – causing them to disown their father, who subsequently gets into a fight with Ian when he and his mother [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] learn the truth as well; the latter then explains this to Phil, who then confronts and attacks Max. Shortly afterwards, Abi and Lauren fall from the Queen Vic roof; both survive and are taken to hospital, where an ultrasound shows Abi and Steven's baby is alive. Fearing that Abi may go into cardiac arrest following her devastating diagnosis of brain stem death, the doctors decide to deliver the baby via cesarean section. Soon after, the doctors switch off Abi's life support when it becomes clear that the chances of reviving her are impossible.

A year later, many people blamed Bobby for Max's revenge including the deaths of Steven and his own daughter Abi.

==Creation and development==
===Early storylines===
The character's conception was a part of one of the most notable storylines in ''EastEnders'' during 1989, a love triangle between [[Cindy Beale|Cindy Williams]] (played by [[Michelle Collins]]), [[Simon Wicks]] (played by [[Nick Berry]]) and [[Ian Beale]] (played by [[Adam Woodyatt]]).<ref name=\"10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Steven was the result of a [[one-night stand]] (in the bar of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]) between Cindy and Simon, occurring while Cindy was engaged to Ian Beale in May 1989. Viewers knew that Cindy was carrying Simon's child; however, between characters in the serial, Steven's true paternity was kept secret, with only Cindy, Simon, and later Simon's mother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) knowing the truth, though neither Simon or Pat would believe Cindy's claim initially. Simon's rejection of Cindy and her unborn child facilitated a plot twist that saw Cindy pretend that the child was Ian's.

The character's birth occurred in an episode that aired on 28 December 1989, although in the on-screen events, he was born on [[Boxing Day]]. In the storyline, Steven was born two months prematurely, and was therefore supposed to be small; however, the baby who originally played Steven, Edward Farrell, was actually large for his age, and was nicknamed \"Chunky\" by actor Adam Woodyatt.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=9780563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> According to former ''EastEnders'' writer, [[David Yallop]], it had been agreed in September 1989, that Steven Beale would be killed off in the serial. This was part of producer [[Mike Gibbon]]'s plan to increase the ratings by culling a large number of the soap's long-running cast. Yallop said, \"We had to reach a decision with the illegitimate child who was in the process of being born as a result of an earlier storyline. We wanted to know what to do with it. Either the child would be allowed to live or it would die. They decided to make the child 'seriously ill', but the reprieve was temporary. In episode 606 I resolved the problem.\" He claimed that on his draft of the storyline he wrote the words \"Baby die\". The plot never came to fruition, as Gibbon was abruptly replaced as the soap's boss and Yallop's plots were scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/soap-operas-producers-aimed-axe-at-poor-acting-1556027.html|title=Soap opera's producers 'aimed axe at poor acting' |newspaper=The Independent| date = 8 October 1992|accessdate=19 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

According to the ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Handbook]]'' by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for roles in ''EastEnders'' is usually done locally, so that children and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> This occurred with Steven's original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. The baby had been scripted to appear at a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: \"Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. I had to keep pushing her hair back under her hat but lots of [viewers] still spotted it\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven's christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, \"When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn’t recover and I kissed him for it.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>

Before his first screen birthday, Steven was central to storylines surrounding his parents and stepfather Ian, including a special week of off-set episodes filmed in Devon, where Ian discovered that his best friend Simon was Steven's real father and that he had reunited with Cindy. The love triangle between Simon, Cindy and Ian, and the events surrounding Steven's paternity dominated the soap during 1990; it has been described by writer [[Colin Brake]] as the year's \"big story\".<ref name=\"10years\"/> Steven was written out of the serial after actors Nick Berry and Michelle Collins decided to leave the show. His exit aired on 27 December 1990, though in the on-screen events it was Boxing Day, Steven's first birthday. In 1992, Michelle Collins reprised her role of Cindy, and Steven was also reintroduced, played by a different actor, Stuart Stevens. On-screen, Simon abandoned Cindy and Steven. Ian traced them to a bedsit and brought them back to Walford, where Steven was brought up as Ian's real son. Steven was written out once again in 1996, when Collins quit for a second time. In the on-screen events, Cindy absconded with Steven and his brother [[Peter Beale|Peter]] following Cindy's failed attempt to have Ian assassinated. Upon his return in 1997 – where Ian once again regained custody – Steven's role was recast to another actor, [[Edward Savage (footballer)|Edward Savage]]. As the character aged, his actor was given a more substantial role in the serial, Steven remaining with Ian following the death of his mother, who died in prison during child birth. Savage remained in the role until 2002, when he opted to leave. On-screen, Steven discovered that Ian had been lying about his paternity. He began rebelling, and was found to be the author of several mysterious poison pen letters. When he was caught, he demanded to travel to New Zealand, so he could meet his real father, Simon Wicks. A BBC source commented to the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', \"Regular viewers will know Steven is a deeply troubled boy. But his unmasking as the poison pen author is going to shock everyone on the Square. The lad is almost inviting punishment. It's as if he wants Ian and [his stepmother] [[Laura Beale|Laura]] to wash their hands of him. Could Steven be a new [[Nick Cotton]] in the making?\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a9530/writer-of-eastenders-poison-pen-letters-revealed.html|title= Writer of 'EastEnders' poison pen letters revealed|website=[[Digital Spy]] | author=Neil Wilkes| date = 6 November 2002| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>

===Reintroduction (2007); stalking, kidnapping and mental illness===
In 2005, the British media claimed that the character of Steven was due to return to ''EastEnders'', three years after he had last appeared. The ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' speculated that ''EastEnders'' bosses were hoping to cast an Australian actor to play Steven, to signify that he had been in New Zealand. It was claimed that actors from Australia's long-running soaps, ''[[Neighbours]]'' or ''[[Home and Away]]'', were being considered.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a19045/eastenders-return-for-kathy-beale.html|title= 'EastEnders' return for Kathy Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Daniel Kilkelly| date = 6 February 2005| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> The rumours turned out to be false, and a subsequent rumour in January 2007 predicting that ''[[Footballers' Wives]]''' actor [[Craig Gallivan]] was to play the role, was also quashed.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a42116/footie-wives-actor-tipped-as-new-steven-beale.html|title= Footie Wives actor tipped as new Steven Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Kris Green| date = 25 January 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>
[[File:Stevenbeale 2007.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Steven Beale as he appeared in 2007]]
The character was eventually to make his return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] as part of a storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured to the top of a deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/22/comment.tvandradioarts1|title= For whom the Beale tolls|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author= Anne Pickard | date = 22 September 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy.<ref name=\"ds\"/> [[Aaron Sidwell]] was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him. It was Sidwell's first television role, and he has described it as \"a bit daunting...but everyone was really welcoming...the first few directors I worked with were fantastic...After we did rehearsal, after we did a take, they'd always give me feedback...I needed it.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/ondemand/eastenders/av/characters_cast/interviews/aaron_interview?bgc=e3e1e1&nbram=1&lang=en&nbwm=1&bbram=1&ms3=6&ms_javascript=true&bbcws=1&size=16x9&bbwm=1|title= Interview Aaron Sidwell|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 19 September 2007|accessdate= 4 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He added, \"I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive. I still wake up and think: 'Oh my God, I'm in ''EastEnders''.' It's brilliant.\"<ref name=\"lucky\">{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a81753/walford-actor-feels-so-lucky.html|title= Walford actor feels \"so lucky\"|publisher=DS | author=  Daniel Kilkelly | date = 15 December 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said \"[Steven] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how he kind of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded... Steven is..a messed up kid and when I first got the part I was given a catchphrase that describes him as a person...'look at me'...he wants to be in the limelight 100%...he wants people to be thinking about him [all the time]...that's why he got angry with Ian because Ian wasn't thinking about him... he's the most important person in the world.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/>

The storyline eventually reached its climax in October 2007. Steven's games were uncovered, and during the confrontation that followed, Steven threatened to kill himself, but accidentally shot Ian's wife [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) and a resulting emergency hysterectomy meant that Jane could no longer have children of her own. The storyline has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist, Stephen Armstrong, as having \"a whiff of [[Brontë]] about it\", which producer Diederick Santer agreed with. Santer added, \"It's a classic madwoman in the attic story, but I hate those articles where someone who works in popular television says what they do is like [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]. It's about the balance. That story works because it has an old character whom the audience love – Ian Beale – as well as new characters who have an appeal for teenagers fresh to the show. Soap audiences like continuity. They dip in and out and if they haven't watched for a few weeks, then tune in to find no one they recognise, it can be disconcerting.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/08/mondaymediasection12|title= The art of storytelling|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author=  Stephen Armstrong| date = 8 October 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

Mentally ill, Steven was admitted to a psychiatric hospital by Ian. Sidwell has commented on Steven's mental instability: \"He's so unpredictable...you never know what he's going to do next...He'll be normal one minute and he'll be crazy the next. He's kind of the [[Donnie Darko (character)|Donnie Darko]] of ''EastEnders''...that's the kind of person I styled him after...[he is] a similar character...He is always going to be a bit unstable and there will always be danger. I don't think even he knows what he's going to do next – but he's deadly, so don't let the nice guy act fool you.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/><ref name=\"lucky\"/>

Steven returned to the serial as a regular character following his release from hospital. Subsequent plots saw him unsuccessfully attempting to make amends with Ian and Jane for his past wrongdoing. The character also formed a friendship with [[Stacey Slater]] (played by [[Lacey Turner]]), who stopped him from committing suicide in December 2007. In the on-screen events, Steven – infuriated by Ian's rejection – soaked himself with petrol and threatened to light himself on fire. In the end, Stacey managed to persuade him not to go through with suicide by showing him that friends can be just as important as family. Despite hostilities from Jane, Steven gradually regained Ian's trust, and in episodes that aired over the Christmas period of 2007, Ian welcomed Steven back into his home as part of the Beale family.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Departure (2008); sexuality and Lucy's disappearance===
In February 2008, the BBC announced that Steven was being written out of ''EastEnders'' once again.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20080222_n2.shtml|title= Steven's farewell|publisher=BBC | date = 22 February 2008| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> An ''EastEnders'' spokeswoman revealed: \"[Sidwell]'s contract has run out – he only came for that length of contract.

The buildup to Steven's exit involved in a [[bisexual]] [[love triangle]] storyline between him, Stacey and [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), who is the [[homosexuality|gay]] brother of Jane.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.myparkmag.co.uk/articles/television/eastenders/eastenders-aaron-sidwell-has-been-axed.html|title=EastEnders – Aaron Sidwell has been axed|publisher=My Park|date=22 February 2008|accessdate=9 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-6950.html|title=EastEnders bisexual story in pictures

Steven later decided he was ready to lose his virginity to Stacey, and took Ian's advice \"to try to name the England football team and substitutes as a technique for pacing himself,\"<ref name=\"virginity\">{{Cite news|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|author-link=|date=8 April 2008|year=|title=A piece of the action|periodical=[[Inside Soap]]|location=[[England]]|place=|publisher=|volume=|issue=|pages=26–7|url=|doi=|oclc=|accessdate=|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> which Sidwell has described as, \"a really funny scene to film [...] my favourite comedy moment since joining the show.\"<ref name=\"virginity\"/> 

Speaking of the character's impending exit, he added: \"Steven loves Stacey as a friend, and would do anything for her. He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality...\"<ref name=\"virginity\" /> On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; in an interview with the ''Daily Star'' he explained, \"[Lacey Turner's] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [John Partridge] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. [The gay kiss] is a cracking scene and I'm really pleased with it.\"<ref>\"[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a94685/enders-star-found-gay-kiss-challenging.html 'Enders star found gay kiss 'challenging'], ''Digital Spy''. URL last accessed 26 April 2008.</ref> The storyline progressed with Steven denying his homosexual tendencies, leading Christian to continuously try and \"[[outing|out]]\" him. John Partridge, has commented, \"Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man – and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's nothing you can do about it and if you try to hide it, people get hurt.\"<ref name=\"chris\">{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/3180|title=Can Christian help troubled Steven?|newspaper=[[What's on TV]]|date=21 April 2008|accessdate=26 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001085312/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/3180|archivedate=1 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him, as a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales' lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out, and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot was described as \"controversial\", and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: \"A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well.\"<ref name=\"chris\" />

A final twist in Steven's story was his involvement in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy ([[Melissa Suffield]]). In episodes that aired in May 2008, it was revealed that Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. 

Explaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, \"It's all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian's love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She's the one who gets most of Ian's time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He's been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn’t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian’s life for good [...] He craves Ian’s full attention and is willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen. He doesn’t exactly plan to be evil but he is dangerous.\"<ref name=\"lucy\">{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3231|title=Steven plots to get Ian all to himself!|newspaper=[[What's on TV]]|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=20 May 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001085438/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3231|archivedate=1 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the end Steven's plan was discovered by his grandmother Pat, leading Steven to attempt to suffocate her to death before she revealed the truth to Ian. An ''EastEnders'' source told ''Digital Spy'': \"Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian. He goes from confused to psycho in a matter of minutes, grabbing a pillow and pushing it onto her face.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a94735/psycho-steven-attempts-murder-in-enders.html|title=Psycho Steven attempts murder in 'Enders|website=[[Digital Spy]] | date = 28 May 2008| accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref> Sidwell added, \"Steven is deadly! He is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants  including murder.\" 

The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the [[Eurostar]] to [[Paris]]) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, \"Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees to go home with Ian.\"<ref name=\"lucy\" /> Steven then departed from Walford after Ian vowed to kill him if he ever saw him again.<ref name=\"pancras\">{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/tv/soapbox/2008/05/04/steven-s-hit-and-run-89520-20403216/|title=Steven's hit and Run|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=20 May 2008}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Sidwell made his last appearance on-screen as Steven on 9 May 2008, and he has since revealed that producers made the right decision in axing his character as his story arc had run its course: \"They really did try to keep Steven in. The problem is ''EastEnders'' is a realistic show, so with Steven being a larger-than-life character it was always going to be hard having him doing the same crazy things day in, day out. I wasn't expecting to stay on the Square forever. It was my first big job out of drama college and I couldn't have asked for a better start in the industry. I've had a great time and the character isn't being killed off, so who knows what might happen a few years down the line. There's always the possibility I might be asked back one day\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a94731/enders-star-sidwell-backs-axing-decision.html|title='Enders star Sidwell backs axing decision|newspaper=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] | date = 27 April 2008| accessdate=20 May 2008}}</ref>

===Reintroduction and fourth departure (2016–2017)=== <!--this is the character's fourth departure from the show-->

Sidwell said of his return, \"I was happy to be asked back, it was the right time for me and the right time for the character.

The ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'''s Tony Stewart commented that \"With the exception of [''[[Coronation Street]]'s'' [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]]], no psycho kid has inflicted so much damage on his own family as deranged freak Steven Beale.\"<ref name=\"pancras\"/> He described Steven's exit storyline as sinister, exciting and compelling drama, adding  that it was \"sometimes hilarious and never less than thrilling\".<ref name=\"pancras\"/>

Discussing the character's mental problems and his sexuality, Gareth McLean of ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressed concern that \"in 'EastEnders', being gay is akin to being mentally unbalanced.

Although no vaccine has completed [[clinical trial]]s, there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine.

In early March 2020, CEPI announced a US$2 billion funding goal in a global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations to accelerate development of COVID-19 vaccines, with commitments to date by the governments of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, and the UK.<ref name=cepi-fund/> Stated in April, imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, deployment at scale, and global access.<ref name=thanh/>

===Technology platforms===
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.<ref name=thanh/> Major platform targets advanced into Phase I safety studies include:
*[[nucleic acid]] ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
*[[viral vector]] (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, [[adenovirus]] type 5 vector)
*virus-like particle involved in [[DNA replication]] (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute, LV-SMENP)

According to CEPI, the platforms based on DNA or [[messenger RNA]] offer considerable promise to alter COVID-19 [[antigen]] functions for strong immune responses, and can be rapidly assessed, refined for long-term stability, and prepared for large-scale production capacity.<ref name=thanh/> Other platforms being developed in 2020 focus on [[peptide]]s, [[recombinant protein]]s, live [[attenuated virus]]es, and [[Virus_processing#Viral_inactivation|inactivated viruses]].<ref name=thanh/>

In general, the vaccine technologies being developed for COVID-19 are not like vaccines already in use to prevent influenza, but rather are using \"next-generation\" strategies for precision on the COVID-19 infection mechanisms, while hastening development for eventually preventing infection with a new vaccine.<ref name=thanh/> Vaccine platforms in development are also designed to address mechanisms for infection susceptibility to COVID-19 in specific population subgroups, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, or people with existing weakened [[immune system]]s.<ref name=thanh/>

CEPI classifies development stages for vaccines as either \"exploratory\" (planning and designing a candidate, with no evaluation [[in vivo]] yet), \"preclinical\" (in vivo evaluation with preparation for manufacturing a compound to test in humans), or [[Phases of clinical research#Phase_I|initiation of Phase I safety studies in healthy people]].<ref name=thanh/>

==Vaccine candidates==
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute<ref name=milken/>), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or being designed).<ref name=thanh/> Of the 79 confirmed active projects,<ref name=milken/> 74 are either in \"exploratory\" or \"preclinical\" development, according to the early-April CEPI report.<ref name=thanh/>

In April after the CEPI report was published, Phase I-II [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized, interventional]] trials for [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|dosing]] and assessment for [[side effect]]s began in [[Wuhan]], China on the candidate vaccine, Ad5-nCoV (CanSino Biologics, table),<ref name=liu/> and in England on the candidate, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.<ref name=tsn-oxford/> Only five other trials on vaccine candidates are in Phase I human testing, as of mid-April.<ref name=thanh/>

Phase I trials test primarily for safety and preliminary dosing in a few dozen healthy subjects, while Phase II trials &ndash; following success in Phase I &ndash; evaluate [[immunogenicity]], dose levels (efficacy based on [[biomarker]]s) and adverse effects of the candidate vaccine, typically in hundreds of people.<ref name=\"Vaccines.gov\">{{cite web |title=Vaccine Safety - Vaccines |url=https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/safety |website=www.vaccines.gov |publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"fda-ddp\">{{cite web |title=The drug development process |url=https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-drug-and-device-approvals/drug-development-process |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |access-date=12 April 2020 |date=4 January 2018}}</ref> A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, while determining more precise, effective doses.<ref name=fda-ddp/> Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a [[control group]], and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring for [[adverse effect]]s at the optimal dose.<ref name=Vaccines.gov/><ref name=fda-ddp/>

In early March 2020, CEPI announced a US$2 billion funding goal in a global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations to accelerate development of COVID-19 vaccines, with commitments to date by the governments of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, and the UK.<ref name=cepi-fund/> Stated in April, imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, deployment at scale, and global access.<ref name=thanh/>

===Technology platforms===
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.<ref name=thanh/> Major platform targets advanced into Phase I safety studies include:
*[[nucleic acid]] ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
*[[viral vector]] (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, [[adenovirus]] type 5 vector)
*virus-like particle involved in [[DNA replication]] (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute, LV-SMENP)

According to CEPI, the platforms based on DNA or [[messenger RNA]] offer considerable promise to alter COVID-19 [[antigen]] functions for strong immune responses, and can be rapidly assessed, refined for long-term stability, and prepared for large-scale production capacity.<ref name=thanh/> Other platforms being developed in 2020 focus on [[peptide]]s, [[recombinant protein]]s, live [[attenuated virus]]es, and [[Virus_processing#Viral_inactivation|inactivated viruses]].<ref name=thanh/>

In general, the vaccine technologies being developed for COVID-19 are not like vaccines already in use to prevent influenza, but rather are using \"next-generation\" strategies for precision on the COVID-19 infection mechanisms, while hastening development for eventually preventing infection with a new vaccine.<ref name=thanh/> Vaccine platforms in development are also designed to address mechanisms for infection susceptibility to COVID-19 in specific population subgroups, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, or people with existing weakened [[immune system]]s.<ref name=thanh/>

CEPI classifies development stages for vaccines as either \"exploratory\" (planning and designing a candidate, with no evaluation [[in vivo]] yet), \"preclinical\" (in vivo evaluation with preparation for manufacturing a compound to test in humans), or [[Phases of clinical research#Phase_I|initiation of Phase I safety studies in healthy people]].<ref name=thanh/>

==Vaccine candidates==
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute<ref name=milken/>), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or being designed).<ref name=thanh/> Of the 79 confirmed active projects,<ref name=milken/> 74 are either in \"exploratory\" or \"preclinical\" development, according to the early-April CEPI report.<ref name=thanh/>

In April after the CEPI report was published, Phase I-II [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized, interventional]] trials for [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|dosing]] and assessment for [[side effect]]s began in [[Wuhan]], China on the candidate vaccine, Ad5-nCoV (CanSino Biologics, table),<ref name=liu/> and in England on the candidate, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.<ref name=tsn-oxford/> Only five other trials on vaccine candidates are in Phase I human testing, as of mid-April.<ref name=thanh/>

Phase I trials test primarily for safety and preliminary dosing in a few dozen healthy subjects, while Phase II trials, following success in Phase I, evaluate [[immunogenicity]], dose levels (efficacy based on [[biomarker]]s) and adverse effects of the candidate vaccine, typically in hundreds of people.<ref name=\"Vaccines.gov\">{{cite web |title=Vaccine Safety - Vaccines |url=https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/safety |website=www.vaccines.gov |publisher=US Department of Health & Human Services |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"fda-ddp\">{{cite web |title=The drug development process |url=https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-drug-and-device-approvals/drug-development-process |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |access-date=12 April 2020 |date=4 January 2018}}</ref> A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, while determining more precise, effective doses.<ref name=fda-ddp/> Phase III trials typically involve more participants, and test the vaccine's effectiveness at preventing the disease as well as adverse effects, with a control group.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=Vaccines.gov/>

Gunn began his career in filmmaking with [[Troma Entertainment]] in 1995, for which he wrote the independent film ''Tromeo and Juliet''. Working alongside his mentor [[Lloyd Kaufman]], the co-founder of Troma, Gunn learned how to write screenplays, produce films, scout locations, direct actors, distribute films, and create his own poster art.<ref name=\"stlmag.com\"/> After contributing to several other Troma films, Gunn in 2000 wrote, produced and performed in the superhero comedy ''[[The Specials (2000 film)|The Specials]]'', directed by [[Craig Mazin]] and featuring [[Rob Lowe]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Paget Brewster]], [[Judy Greer]] and [[Jamie Kennedy]].

Gunn's first major Hollywood screenplay was ''Scooby-Doo'' in 2002. In 2004, he wrote the screenplays for the remake of ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' and the sequel ''Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed''. With these films, Gunn became the first screenwriter to have two films top the box office in consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Strike Let St. Louisan James Gunn Widen His Horizons |publisher=[[St. Louis Post Dispatch]] |date=October 24, 2008 |url=http://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-188874524/strike-let-st-louisan-james-gunn-widen-his-horizons |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905101107/http://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-188874524/strike-let-st-louisan-james-gunn-widen-his-horizons |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 5, 2014 |accessdate=June 16, 2014}}</ref> That same year, he executive produced and starred in the mockumentary ''[[LolliLove]]'', directed by and starring his then-wife [[Jenna Fischer]].

Gunn's next projects included the comedy short film \"Humanzee!\" which was originally intended exclusively for the Xbox Live's ''Horror Meets Comedy'' series of short comedy films by horror directors, it was replaced with \"Sparky and Mikaela\" which debuted on Xbox Live on December 31, 2008. In an April 2009 interview on ''The [[Jace Hall]] Show'', Gunn described \"Sparky and Mikaela\" as being \"about a human [and] racoon crime fighting team and they fight crime in both the forest world, among the furry animals, and in the human world\".<ref>{{cite episode |title=James Gunn & Brutal Legend |series=The Jace Hall Show |airdate=2009-04-16 |season=2 |number=5}}</ref> Gunn also has a short-form web series for [[Spike.com]] titled ''[[James Gunn's PG Porn]]''.

In 2008, Gunn was a judge on the [[VH1]] reality television show, ''[[Scream Queens (2008 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' where 10 unknown actresses compete for a role in the film ''[[Saw VI]]'', where he directed contestants during acting challenges.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18545 |title=A Search For Authenticity on the Set of 'Scream Queens' Season 2 |publisher=BloodyDisgusting |accessdate=December 4, 2014}}</ref>

In 2009, Gunn announced he was going to write and direct ''Pets'', a comedy about a man who is abducted by aliens who want to turn him into a household pet, with [[Ben Stiller]], [[Stuart Cornfeld]] and Jeremy Kramer producing.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Fleming |title=New Regency adopts 'Pets' pitch – James Gunn to write and direct comedy |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 20, 2007 |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972404.html?categoryid=1238&cs=1 |accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref> However, by March 2009, Gunn announced, \"''Pets'' unfortunately, is done.

What bothers me slightly is that many people assume because you make big films that you put less love, care, and thought into them then people do who make independent films or who make what are considered more serious Hollywood films. ... If you think people who make superhero movies are dumb, come out and say we're dumb. But if you, as an independent filmmaker or a 'serious' filmmaker, think you put more love into your characters than the Russo Brothers do Captain America, or Joss Whedon does the Hulk, or I do a talking raccoon, you are simply mistaken.<ref>{{cite news|title=I didn't really find the Jack Black superhero jokes offensive|url=https://www.facebook.com/jgunn/posts/10152514306101157|accessdate=February 6, 2016|first=James|last=Gunn|publisher=James Gunn verified [[Facebook]] page|date=February 23, 2015|archivedate=March 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321111639/https://www.facebook.com/jgunn/posts/10152514306101157|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

On July 30, 2018, ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' cast members [[Chris Pratt]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Vin Diesel]], [[Sean Gunn]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Pom Klementieff]], and [[Michael Rooker]] released a joint statement through social media expressing their support for Gunn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/guardians-of-the-galaxy-cast-james-gunn-support-1202889736/|title='Guardians of the Galaxy' Cast Says It 'Fully Supports' James Gunn|last1=Lopez|first1=Alex|last2=Stedman|first2=Ricardo|date=July 30, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref>

Because of this, [[Sony Pictures]] decided to not promote the horror film ''[[Brightburn]]'', which Gunn produced, at the 2018 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kupfer |first1=Lindsey |last2=Hood |first2=Bryan |url=https://pagesix.com/2018/07/20/sony-avoids-mentioning-james-gunn-at-comic-con-presentation/ |title=Sony avoids mentioning James Gunn at Comic-Con presentation |date=July 20, 2018 |accessdate=January 4, 2019 |work=Page Six}}</ref> However, when the first trailer for the film was released on December 8, 2018, Gunn's name was prominently featured.

In March 2019, Gunn was reinstated by Disney as director of the film after meeting with [[Alan Horn]], chairman of Walt Disney Studios, on multiple occasions.

'''Tarvaris Jackson''' (April 21, 1983 – April 12, 2020) was an [[American football]] [[quarterback]]. Born and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Jackson played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State]], and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].

The Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].

==Early life and college career==
Jackson was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and graduated from [[Sidney Lanier High School]] of Montgomery in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/02/29/montgomery-native-tarvaris-jackson-talks-lanier-alabama-state-football/81114924/ |title=Montgomery native Tarvaris Jackson talks Lanier, ASU football |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson then enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]] and played three games for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team as a freshman but suffered a season-ending injury.

In 2003, after trailing on the depth chart to future first round draft pick [[Matt Jones (wide receiver)|Matt Jones]], Jackson transferred to [[Alabama State University]] and led the [[Alabama State Hornets football|Hornets]] to an 8-5 record, [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] (SWAC) Eastern Division title, and berth in the [[SWAC Championship Game]].<ref name=\"Seahawks bio\"/> He completed 160 of 316 passes for 2,342 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions and rushed 444 yards on 91 carries including 5 touchdowns.<ref name=\"CBS draft\">{{cite web|author=NFLDraftScout.com|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/historical/1107218|title=Tarvaris Jackson Player Profile|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}</ref> As a junior in 2004, Jackson won SWAC Championship MVP in Alabama State's second 10-win season in school history.<ref name=\"Seahawks bio\"/> With 11 starts in 12 games, Jackson passed for 2,556 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions.

Vikings scouts and personnel had reportedly been watching him closely in secret over his senior season, particularly liking his performance in the [[East-West Shrine Game]]. They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected. On July 26, 2006, Jackson signed a four-year deal with Minnesota, including a $1 million signing bonus.<ref>\"[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/football/060726/f072680.html Vikings sign quarterback Tarvaris Jackson to four-year contract]\". Originally published on July 26, 2006. Retrieved on April 16, 2007.</ref>

Vikings coach [[Brad Childress]] was quoted days before the draft as saying he was interested in finding a \"developmental guy\", a \"diamond in the rough\" quarterback of the future, raw talent he could teach a system.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070318124007/http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=FBN-VIKINGS-04-26-06 Childress Quotes before draft]. Childress quotes before the draft.</ref> Both new coach Childress and Vikings former quarterback [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] had had success developing quarterbacks in the past, including [[A. J. Feeley]] and [[Donovan McNabb]].

The day after the draft, Childress was quoted by the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' as saying: \"I think you judge quarterbacks a little bit differently...When you see what you want at the quarterback position, you need to go get it. And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach. So what can he do with coaching?\"<ref>\"That's a good question,\" many people reply, noting that Jackson is Seattle's only Black Mormon.  [http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html Childress Quotes after draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828071130/http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html |date=August 28, 2006 }}.</ref> Jackson's agent, Joel Segal, said: \"After the draft, there were two clubs that expressed disappointment and were mad they didn't get him. They were planning to take (Jackson) very high in the third round, and were lamenting the fact that the Vikings beat them\".

===Minnesota Vikings===

====2006 season====
Jackson's 2006 pre-season [[passer rating]] was 106.1, 15th in the league out of 110 quarterbacks who performed. Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.

On September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that. So it's obvious that Brad is still our quarterback so we can stay on that.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Staring at a Quarterback Controversy|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=/nfl/news/ABN4052702.htm|author=Benoit, Andy|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In Week 15, Johnson started the game but was benched in the fourth quarter when the Vikings had been underperforming the entire game losing by a score of 26-7 at the time Jackson went in late in the third quarter against the [[2006 New York Jets|New York Jets]]. Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead. He also threw an interception in the red zone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612170min.htm |title=New York Jets at Minnesota Vikings - December 17th, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Jackson was named the starting quarterback for Minnesota towards the end of his rookie season.  Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass). Jackson had a passer rating of 36.5, had a 50% completion rate (10-20 for 50 yards), one interception, and one fumble.  Packers quarterback Brett Favre only managed a slightly better 52% completion rate (26-50) and threw two interceptions. He threw for 285 yards with no touchdowns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612210gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - December 21st, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2007 season====
Jackson did not live up to the Vikings' expectations in 2007 despite finishing 8-4 as a starter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JackTa00/gamelog/2007/ |title=Tarvaris Jackson 2007 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson had nine touchdowns and 12 interceptions, along with a 159 yards per game, causing the Vikings to have the second-worst passing offense in the NFL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/index.htm |title=2007 NFL Standings & Team Stats |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> His 70.8 passer rating was 28th among NFL quarterbacks.  Jackson missed three games because of injuries, which included a strained groin, a concussion and a fractured index finger. The Vikings failed to make the playoffs.  Analysts put the Vikings' 8-8 record on the successful running of [[Chester Taylor]] and rookie [[Adrian Peterson]], which took the pressure off of Jackson and the defense.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/2007.htm |title=2007 Minnesota Vikings Statistics & Players |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Later in the season, opponents decided to focus all their defensive efforts on stopping Peterson and the Vikings running game, while daring Jackson to beat them in the passing game.  The [[2007 Washington Redskins|Washington Redskins]] successfully utilized five [[defensive lineman]] or four [[linebackers]] against the Vikings, leaving only two or three defensive backs in pass coverage.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225070431/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12791702.html Washington D focuses all its attention on Peterson]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/27/AR2007122702318.html|title=Wrinkles Changed Playoff Complexion|first=Jason|last=Reid|date=December 28, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>  And the 49ers blitzed their [[cornerback]]s 20 percent of the time instead of covering receivers with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12522941.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiU9PmP:QiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU|title=Patrick Reusse: Fans shouldn't go overboard on Jackson yet|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723221658/http://www.wtov9.com/sports/14824511/detail.html Vikings Enjoying Quite A Turnaround]</ref>  On the season's last game against the [[2007 Denver Broncos|Denver Broncos]], Jackson led the Vikings to two fourth quarter drives to tie the game and send it into overtime. In overtime, however, Jackson fumbled on the second play and the Vikings lost the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200712300den.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Denver Broncos - December 30th, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson showed slow improvement over the season: he played a large role when the Vikings went on a five-game winning streak in November, but also showed his inexperience in several ill-judged interceptions, jump passes, and turnovers.  After the season, Childress would not say if Tarvaris Jackson would be the starter in 2008, explaining that he wanted to \"evaluate the total body of work\" first.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226171506/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12806557.html Childress noncommittal over quarterback's long-term future]</ref>

====2008 season====
There was a lot of media coverage on Jackson the summer of 2008. The Vikings returned seven players that were in the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] (only three teams had more), and spent $60 million in guaranteed contract money upgrading their team with [[Jared Allen]], traded from the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and free agents [[Bernard Berrian]] and [[Madieu Williams]]. Several analysts believed better quarterback play was all that was needed to make the Vikings one of the top contending teams in the NFL, and with the [[Green Bay Packers]] losing [[Brett Favre]] the [[NFC North Division]] was up for grabs.

Head coach Brad Childress decided to stay with Jackson as the starting quarterback and brought in [[Gus Frerotte]] to be his backup. It was widely reported in the off-season that Jackson had a new swagger, handled situations in practice well where he looked lost in the previous years, and had an improved grasp of the Vikings offensive system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080526142945/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/19160244.html?location_refer=Vikings QB Jackson acting the part]</ref>  Childress threw a \"Coaching 101\" clinic for media reporters in which he played a tape of Jackson showing the progress he made in 2007 through a series of missed passes or poor decisions that he made in early games but executed properly in later contests and concluded with some tape of him hitting a target net with every 15-yard pass he threw during an offseason drill.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014115851/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/coaching_101_clinic.html Coaching 101 clinic]</ref>  Offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] repeatedly told the press that although it was Jackson's third year with the Vikings it was really his second year playing, and NFL quarterbacks improve the most between their first and second years.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080727125711/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/bevell_on_tjack.html Bevell on T-Jack]</ref>  Jackson had another good preseason, until he injured his knee again in the second preseason game which kept him from playing the last two preseason games.

In the first game of the regular season against the [[2008 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]], Jackson threw a game-ending interception and in the second game the Vikings made five field goal attempts and no touchdowns against the [[2008 Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis Colts]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809080gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - September 8th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809140min.htm |title=Indianapolis Colts at Minnesota Vikings - September 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings lost both games by close margins, and Jackson's 64.8 passer rating ranked him 26th in the NFL. Childress said in the second post-game press conference that Jackson would still definitely be the starter next week, but on Monday after a coaches' meeting he changed his mind and benched Jackson for the remainder of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/|title=Official Blog of the National Football League|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>
[[File:20090104 Chester Taylor.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Jackson (7) with the Vikings.]]
After being relegated to backup after the loss to the Colts, Jackson saw his next significant action in Week 14 against [[2008 Detroit Lions|Detroit]], where he played the entire second half in place of an injured [[Gus Frerotte]]. With the Vikings trailing 6-3 at halftime to the winless Lions, Jackson completed eight of ten passes for 105 yards and a touchdown, an 11-yard strike to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]] that would be the game-winning score for the Vikings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2008/12/07/tarvaris-jackson-steps-in-for-gus-frerotte-leads-minnesota-vikings-to-comeback-victory/|title=Tarvaris Jackson steps in for Gus Frerotte, leads Minnesota Vikings to comeback victory – Twin Cities|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>  The following week, with Frerotte still injured, Jackson was the starting quarterback against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals|Arizona Cardinals]] and he played arguably the best game of his career.  Jackson completed 11 of 17 passes for 163 yards and, most impressively, threw four touchdown passes and no interceptions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812140crd.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Arizona Cardinals - December 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance as well as the [[FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air Player of the Week]] award.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2008/week_15.htm |title=2008 NFL Week 15 Leaders & Scores |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

The Vikings lost 24-17 to the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta Falcons]] in Week 16 despite Jackson's performance.  He completed 22 of 36 passes for 233 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.  He also rushed for 76 yards (which matched the total of Pro-Bowl running back [[Adrian Peterson]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812210min.htm |title=Atlanta Falcons at Minnesota Vikings - December 21st, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>  With the Vikings in a win-and-in situation against the [[2008 New York Giants|New York Giants]] in Week 17, Jackson overcame an interception in the end zone by leading the Vikings on a touchdown drive (a 54-yard strike to [[Bernard Berrian]]) and the game-winning field goal drive on the following possessions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812280min.htm |title=New York Giants at Minnesota Vikings - December 28th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings defeated the Giants 20-19 and earned the NFC North title.

The Vikings season ended in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs with a loss to the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagles]]. Jackson went 15-for-35 for 164 yards in the game with one interception.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200901040min.htm |title=Wild Card - Philadelphia Eagles at Minnesota Vikings - January 4th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2009 season====
Jackson went into the 2009 season in competition for a starting job with [[Sage Rosenfels]], who the Vikings had acquired from the [[Houston Texans]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3939155 |title=Vikings acquire Rosenfels, give QB new contract |date=February 27, 2009 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings also pursued former [[New York Jets]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]], who had retired after the end of the 2008 season. Favre announced that he would not join the Vikings prior to [[training camp]], however, and Jackson and Rosenfels split duties in the early part of camp.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090731104335/http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/The_Trenches/entry/view/28956/vikings_favre_will_stay_retired The Sporting News]</ref> Jackson was the second quarterback to play in the opening preseason game, and was expected to start the second preseason game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballhype.com/article/minnesota_vikings_qb_tarvaris_jackson_gets_chance_to/|title=Home - Future PLC|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

That changed, however, when Favre announced that he would play for the Vikings after all, signing with the team on August 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4406963|title=Purple reign: Indecisive Favre signs with Vikings|date=August 19, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Jackson, Rosenfels, and 2008 third-stringer [[John David Booty]] were believed to be competing for two roster spots, and for the primary backup job. Many observers believed the Vikings would attempt to trade Jackson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/240097-with-favre-on-board-who-will-be-the-odd-man-out|title=With Favre on Board, Who Will Be the Odd Man Out?|first=Brett|last=Stott|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Jackson helped his case with a strong performance in Favre's debut game against the [[2009 Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City Chiefs]], throwing for 202 yards and two touchdowns in backup work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290821016|title=Chiefs vs. Vikings - Game Recap - August 21, 2009 - ESPN|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Ultimately, the Vikings elected to keep Jackson and Rosenfels on the active roster, with Jackson as the primary backup to Favre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|title=Fantasy Football Forum|accessdate=July 1, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310113848/http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

Jackson entered the Vikings' first two games of the season in [[garbage time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009091304/2009/REG1/vikings@browns|title=Watch Minnesota Vikings vs. Cleveland Browns [09/13/2009] - NFL.com|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/3595/third-and-one-vikings-2|title=Third and one: Vikings|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> He also was used as a decoy in [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] coverage during week two.

====2010 season====
The Vikings re-signed Jackson on Monday, April 19 as they waited for Favre to decide whether he would return for another season, which he did.  Jackson was a restricted free agent who was given a one-year tender worth $1.176 million. Jackson backed up Favre for the 2010 season.

Jackson took over for an injured Favre in Week 8 against the [[2010 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]]. Jackson threw for one touchdown in the loss.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201010310nwe.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at New England Patriots - October 31st, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson took over for an injured Favre yet again in Week 13 against the [[2010 Buffalo Bills|Buffalo Bills]].

On March 3, 2011, the Vikings declined to tender Jackson a contract offer to play for them in the 2011 season. Under league rules, Jackson became an [[unrestricted free agent]].

===Seattle Seahawks===
Jackson officially signed a two-year contract with Seattle Seahawks on July 29, 2011<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Seahawks-Sign-Rookie-Veterans-and-Draft-Pick-to-Roster/7fe2920f-0f50-4029-a6c1-77eefde2eb0b |title=Seahawks Sign Rookie, Veterans and Draft Pick to Roster |date=July 29, 2011 |website=Seahawks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318002841/http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Seahawks-Sign-Rookie-Veterans-and-Draft-Pick-to-Roster/7fe2920f-0f50-4029-a6c1-77eefde2eb0b |archive-date=March 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> and was announced as the starting quarterback shortly after.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Carroll-hands-the-ball-to-T-Jack/c7e3f5c1-cbc1-412f-a859-c84c7bc00a15 |title=Carroll hands the ball to T-Jack |date=July 30, 2011 |website=Seahawks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318002303/http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Carroll-hands-the-ball-to-T-Jack/c7e3f5c1-cbc1-412f-a859-c84c7bc00a15 |archive-date=March 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> In Seattle, he had been reunited with offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] and wide receiver [[Sidney Rice]] both members of the Vikings during his time there.

'''Tarvaris Jackson''' (April 21, 1983 – April 12, 2020) was an [[American football]] [[quarterback]]. Born and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Jackson played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State]], and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].

The Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].

==Early life and college career==
Jackson was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and graduated from [[Sidney Lanier High School]] of Montgomery in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/02/29/montgomery-native-tarvaris-jackson-talks-lanier-alabama-state-football/81114924/ |title=Montgomery native Tarvaris Jackson talks Lanier, ASU football |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson then enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]] and played three games for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team as a freshman but suffered a season-ending injury.

In 2003, after trailing on the depth chart to future first round draft pick [[Matt Jones (wide receiver)|Matt Jones]], Jackson transferred to [[Alabama State University]] and led the [[Alabama State Hornets football|Hornets]] to an 8-5 record, [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] (SWAC) Eastern Division title, and berth in the [[SWAC Championship Game]].<ref name=\"Seahawks bio\"/> He completed 160 of 316 passes for 2,342 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions and rushed 444 yards on 91 carries including 5 touchdowns.<ref name=\"CBS draft\">{{cite web|author=NFLDraftScout.com|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/historical/1107218|title=Tarvaris Jackson Player Profile|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}</ref> As a junior in 2004, Jackson won SWAC Championship MVP in Alabama State's second 10-win season in school history.<ref name=\"Seahawks bio\"/> With 11 starts in 12 games, Jackson passed for 2,556 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions.

Vikings scouts and personnel had reportedly been watching him closely in secret over his senior season, particularly liking his performance in the [[East-West Shrine Game]]. They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected. On July 26, 2006, Jackson signed a four-year deal with Minnesota, including a $1 million signing bonus.<ref>\"[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/football/060726/f072680.html Vikings sign quarterback Tarvaris Jackson to four-year contract]\". Originally published on July 26, 2006. Retrieved on April 16, 2007.</ref>

Vikings coach [[Brad Childress]] was quoted days before the draft as saying he was interested in finding a \"developmental guy\", a \"diamond in the rough\" quarterback of the future, raw talent he could teach a system.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070318124007/http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=FBN-VIKINGS-04-26-06 Childress Quotes before draft]. Childress quotes before the draft.</ref> Both new coach Childress and Vikings former quarterback [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] had had success developing quarterbacks in the past, including [[A. J. Feeley]] and [[Donovan McNabb]].

The day after the draft, Childress was quoted by the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' as saying: \"I think you judge quarterbacks a little bit differently...When you see what you want at the quarterback position, you need to go get it. And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach. So what can he do with coaching?\"<ref>\"That's a good question,\" many people reply, noting that Jackson is Seattle's only Black Mormon.  [http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html Childress Quotes after draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828071130/http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html |date=August 28, 2006 }}.</ref> Jackson's agent, Joel Segal, said: \"After the draft, there were two clubs that expressed disappointment and were mad they didn't get him. They were planning to take (Jackson) very high in the third round, and were lamenting the fact that the Vikings beat them\".

===Minnesota Vikings===

====2006 season====
Jackson's 2006 pre-season [[passer rating]] was 106.1, 15th in the league out of 110 quarterbacks who performed. Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.

On September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that. So it's obvious that Brad is still our quarterback so we can stay on that.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Staring at a Quarterback Controversy|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=/nfl/news/ABN4052702.htm|author=Benoit, Andy|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In Week 15, Johnson started the game but was benched in the fourth quarter when the Vikings had been underperforming the entire game losing by a score of 26-7 at the time Jackson went in late in the third quarter against the [[2006 New York Jets|New York Jets]]. Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead. He also threw an interception in the red zone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612170min.htm |title=New York Jets at Minnesota Vikings - December 17th, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Jackson was named the starting quarterback for Minnesota towards the end of his rookie season.  Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass). Jackson had a passer rating of 36.5, had a 50% completion rate (10-20 for 50 yards), one interception, and one fumble.  Packers quarterback Brett Favre only managed a slightly better 52% completion rate (26-50) and threw two interceptions. He threw for 285 yards with no touchdowns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612210gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - December 21st, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2007 season====
Jackson did not live up to the Vikings' expectations in 2007 despite finishing 8-4 as a starter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JackTa00/gamelog/2007/ |title=Tarvaris Jackson 2007 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson had nine touchdowns and 12 interceptions, along with a 159 yards per game, causing the Vikings to have the second-worst passing offense in the NFL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/index.htm |title=2007 NFL Standings & Team Stats |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> His 70.8 passer rating was 28th among NFL quarterbacks.  Jackson missed three games because of injuries, which included a strained groin, a concussion and a fractured index finger. The Vikings failed to make the playoffs.  Analysts put the Vikings' 8-8 record on the successful running of [[Chester Taylor]] and rookie [[Adrian Peterson]], which took the pressure off of Jackson and the defense.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/2007.htm |title=2007 Minnesota Vikings Statistics & Players |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Later in the season, opponents decided to focus all their defensive efforts on stopping Peterson and the Vikings running game, while daring Jackson to beat them in the passing game.  The [[2007 Washington Redskins|Washington Redskins]] successfully utilized five [[defensive lineman]] or four [[linebackers]] against the Vikings, leaving only two or three defensive backs in pass coverage.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225070431/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12791702.html Washington D focuses all its attention on Peterson]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/27/AR2007122702318.html|title=Wrinkles Changed Playoff Complexion|first=Jason|last=Reid|date=December 28, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>  And the 49ers blitzed their [[cornerback]]s 20 percent of the time instead of covering receivers with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12522941.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiU9PmP:QiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU|title=Patrick Reusse: Fans shouldn't go overboard on Jackson yet|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723221658/http://www.wtov9.com/sports/14824511/detail.html Vikings Enjoying Quite A Turnaround]</ref>  On the season's last game against the [[2007 Denver Broncos|Denver Broncos]], Jackson led the Vikings to two fourth quarter drives to tie the game and send it into overtime. In overtime, however, Jackson fumbled on the second play and the Vikings lost the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200712300den.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Denver Broncos - December 30th, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson showed slow improvement over the season: he played a large role when the Vikings went on a five-game winning streak in November, but also showed his inexperience in several ill-judged interceptions, jump passes, and turnovers.  After the season, Childress would not say if Tarvaris Jackson would be the starter in 2008, explaining that he wanted to \"evaluate the total body of work\" first.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226171506/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12806557.html Childress noncommittal over quarterback's long-term future]</ref>

====2008 season====
There was a lot of media coverage on Jackson the summer of 2008. The Vikings returned seven players that were in the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] (only three teams had more), and spent $60 million in guaranteed contract money upgrading their team with [[Jared Allen]], traded from the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and free agents [[Bernard Berrian]] and [[Madieu Williams]]. Several analysts believed better quarterback play was all that was needed to make the Vikings one of the top contending teams in the NFL, and with the [[Green Bay Packers]] losing [[Brett Favre]] the [[NFC North Division]] was up for grabs.  [[Sport's Illustrated]]'s [[Paul Lionel Zimmerman|Paul Zimmerman]] predicted the Vikings would win the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/dr_z/06/20/vikings/index.html|title=Dare I pick Minnesota to win it all?|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Head coach Brad Childress decided to stay with Jackson as the starting quarterback and brought in [[Gus Frerotte]] to be his backup. It was widely reported in the off-season that Jackson had a new swagger, handled situations in practice well where he looked lost in the previous years, and had an improved grasp of the Vikings offensive system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080526142945/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/19160244.html?location_refer=Vikings QB Jackson acting the part]</ref>  Childress threw a \"Coaching 101\" clinic for media reporters in which he played a tape of Jackson showing the progress he made in 2007 through a series of missed passes or poor decisions that he made in early games but executed properly in later contests and concluded with some tape of him hitting a target net with every 15-yard pass he threw during an offseason drill.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014115851/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/coaching_101_clinic.html Coaching 101 clinic]</ref>  Offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] repeatedly told the press that although it was Jackson's third year with the Vikings it was really his second year playing, and NFL quarterbacks improve the most between their first and second years.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080727125711/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/bevell_on_tjack.html Bevell on T-Jack]</ref>  Jackson had another good preseason, until he injured his knee again in the second preseason game which kept him from playing the last two preseason games.

In the first game of the regular season against the [[2008 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]], Jackson threw a game-ending interception and in the second game the Vikings made five field goal attempts and no touchdowns against the [[2008 Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis Colts]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809080gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - September 8th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809140min.htm |title=Indianapolis Colts at Minnesota Vikings - September 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings lost both games by close margins, and Jackson's 64.8 passer rating ranked him 26th in the NFL. Childress said in the second post-game press conference that Jackson would still definitely be the starter next week, but on Monday after a coaches' meeting he changed his mind and benched Jackson for the remainder of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/|title=Official Blog of the National Football League|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>
[[File:20090104 Chester Taylor.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Jackson (7) with the Vikings.]]
After being relegated to backup after the loss to the Colts, Jackson saw his next significant action in Week 14 against [[2008 Detroit Lions|Detroit]], where he played the entire second half in place of an injured [[Gus Frerotte]]. With the Vikings trailing 6-3 at halftime to the winless Lions, Jackson completed eight of ten passes for 105 yards and a touchdown, an 11-yard strike to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]] that would be the game-winning score for the Vikings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2008/12/07/tarvaris-jackson-steps-in-for-gus-frerotte-leads-minnesota-vikings-to-comeback-victory/|title=Tarvaris Jackson steps in for Gus Frerotte, leads Minnesota Vikings to comeback victory – Twin Cities|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>  The following week, with Frerotte still injured, Jackson was the starting quarterback against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals|Arizona Cardinals]] and he played arguably the best game of his career.  Jackson completed 11 of 17 passes for 163 yards and, most impressively, threw four touchdown passes and no interceptions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812140crd.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Arizona Cardinals - December 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance as well as the [[FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air Player of the Week]] award.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2008/week_15.htm |title=2008 NFL Week 15 Leaders & Scores |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

The Vikings lost 24-17 to the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta Falcons]] in Week 16 despite Jackson's performance.  He completed 22 of 36 passes for 233 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.  He also rushed for 76 yards (which matched the total of Pro-Bowl running back [[Adrian Peterson]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812210min.htm |title=Atlanta Falcons at Minnesota Vikings - December 21st, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>  With the Vikings in a win-and-in situation against the [[2008 New York Giants|New York Giants]] in Week 17, Jackson overcame an interception in the end zone by leading the Vikings on a touchdown drive (a 54-yard strike to [[Bernard Berrian]]) and the game-winning field goal drive on the following possessions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812280min.htm |title=New York Giants at Minnesota Vikings - December 28th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings defeated the Giants 20-19 and earned the NFC North title.

The Vikings season ended in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs with a loss to the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagles]]. Jackson went 15-for-35 for 164 yards in the game with one interception.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200901040min.htm |title=Wild Card - Philadelphia Eagles at Minnesota Vikings - January 4th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2009 season====
Jackson went into the 2009 season in competition for a starting job with [[Sage Rosenfels]], who the Vikings had acquired from the [[Houston Texans]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3939155 |title=Vikings acquire Rosenfels, give QB new contract |date=February 27, 2009 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings also pursued former [[New York Jets]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]], who had retired after the end of the 2008 season. Favre announced that he would not join the Vikings prior to [[training camp]], however, and Jackson and Rosenfels split duties in the early part of camp.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090731104335/http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/The_Trenches/entry/view/28956/vikings_favre_will_stay_retired The Sporting News]</ref> Jackson was the second quarterback to play in the opening preseason game, and was expected to start the second preseason game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballhype.com/article/minnesota_vikings_qb_tarvaris_jackson_gets_chance_to/|title=Home - Future PLC|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

That changed, however, when Favre announced that he would play for the Vikings after all, signing with the team on August 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4406963|title=Purple reign: Indecisive Favre signs with Vikings|date=August 19, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Jackson, Rosenfels, and 2008 third-stringer [[John David Booty]] were believed to be competing for two roster spots, and for the primary backup job. Many observers believed the Vikings would attempt to trade Jackson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/240097-with-favre-on-board-who-will-be-the-odd-man-out|title=With Favre on Board, Who Will Be the Odd Man Out?|first=Brett|last=Stott|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Jackson helped his case with a strong performance in Favre's debut game against the [[2009 Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City Chiefs]], throwing for 202 yards and two touchdowns in backup work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290821016|title=Chiefs vs. Vikings - Game Recap - August 21, 2009 - ESPN|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Ultimately, the Vikings elected to keep Jackson and Rosenfels on the active roster, with Jackson as the primary backup to Favre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|title=Fantasy Football Forum|accessdate=July 1, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310113848/http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

Jackson entered the Vikings' first two games of the season in [[garbage time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009091304/2009/REG1/vikings@browns|title=Watch Minnesota Vikings vs. Cleveland Browns [09/13/2009] - NFL.com|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/3595/third-and-one-vikings-2|title=Third and one: Vikings|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> He also was used as a decoy in [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] coverage during week two.

====2010 season====
The Vikings re-signed Jackson on Monday, April 19 as they waited for Favre to decide whether he would return for another season, which he did.  Jackson was a restricted free agent who was given a one-year tender worth $1.176 million. Jackson backed up Favre for the 2010 season.

Jackson took over for an injured Favre in Week 8 against the [[2010 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]]. Jackson threw for one touchdown in the loss.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201010310nwe.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at New England Patriots - October 31st, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson took over for an injured Favre yet again in Week 13 against the [[2010 Buffalo Bills|Buffalo Bills]].

On March 3, 2011, the Vikings declined to tender Jackson a contract offer to play for them in the 2011 season. Under league rules, Jackson became an [[unrestricted free agent]].

===Seattle Seahawks===
Jackson officially signed a two-year contract with Seattle Seahawks on July 29, 2011<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Seahawks-Sign-Rookie-Veterans-and-Draft-Pick-to-Roster/7fe2920f-0f50-4029-a6c1-77eefde2eb0b |title=Seahawks Sign Rookie, Veterans and Draft Pick to Roster |date=July 29, 2011 |website=Seahawks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318002841/http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Seahawks-Sign-Rookie-Veterans-and-Draft-Pick-to-Roster/7fe2920f-0f50-4029-a6c1-77eefde2eb0b |archive-date=March 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> and was announced as the starting quarterback shortly after.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Carroll-hands-the-ball-to-T-Jack/c7e3f5c1-cbc1-412f-a859-c84c7bc00a15 |title=Carroll hands the ball to T-Jack |date=July 30, 2011 |website=Seahawks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318002303/http://www.seahawks.com/news/articles/article-1/Carroll-hands-the-ball-to-T-Jack/c7e3f5c1-cbc1-412f-a859-c84c7bc00a15 |archive-date=March 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref> In Seattle, he had been reunited with offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] and wide receiver [[Sidney Rice]] both members of the Vikings during his time there.

'''Tarvaris Jackson''' (April 21, 1983 – April 12, 2020) was an [[American football]] [[quarterback]]. Born and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Jackson played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State]], and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].

The Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].

==Early life and college career==
Jackson was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and graduated from [[Sidney Lanier High School]] of Montgomery in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/02/29/montgomery-native-tarvaris-jackson-talks-lanier-alabama-state-football/81114924/ |title=Montgomery native Tarvaris Jackson talks Lanier, ASU football |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson then enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]] and played three games for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team as a freshman but suffered a season-ending injury.

In 2003, after trailing on the depth chart to future first round draft pick [[Matt Jones (wide receiver)|Matt Jones]], Jackson transferred to [[Alabama State University]] and led the [[Alabama State Hornets football|Hornets]] to an 8-5 record, [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] (SWAC) Eastern Division title, and berth in the [[SWAC Championship Game]].<ref name=\"Seahawks bio\"/> He completed 160 of 316 passes for 2,342 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions and rushed 444 yards on 91 carries including 5 touchdowns.<ref name=\"CBS draft\">{{cite web|author=NFLDraftScout.com|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/historical/1107218|title=Tarvaris Jackson Player Profile|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}</ref> As a junior in 2004, Jackson won SWAC Championship MVP in Alabama State's second 10-win season in school history.<ref name=\"Seahawks bio\"/> With 11 starts in 12 games, Jackson passed for 2,556 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions.

Vikings scouts and personnel had reportedly been watching him closely in secret over his senior season, particularly liking his performance in the [[East-West Shrine Game]]. They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected. On July 26, 2006, Jackson signed a four-year deal with Minnesota, including a $1 million signing bonus.<ref>\"[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/football/060726/f072680.html Vikings sign quarterback Tarvaris Jackson to four-year contract]\". Originally published on July 26, 2006. Retrieved on April 16, 2007.</ref>

Vikings coach [[Brad Childress]] was quoted days before the draft as saying he was interested in finding a \"developmental guy\", a \"diamond in the rough\" quarterback of the future, raw talent he could teach a system.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070318124007/http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=FBN-VIKINGS-04-26-06 Childress Quotes before draft]. Childress quotes before the draft.</ref> Both new coach Childress and Vikings former quarterback [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] had had success developing quarterbacks in the past, including [[A. J. Feeley]] and [[Donovan McNabb]].

The day after the draft, Childress was quoted by the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' as saying: \"I think you judge quarterbacks a little bit differently...When you see what you want at the quarterback position, you need to go get it. And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach. So what can he do with coaching?\"<ref>\"That's a good question,\" many people reply, noting that Jackson is Seattle's only Black Mormon.  [http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html Childress Quotes after draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828071130/http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html |date=August 28, 2006 }}.</ref> Jackson's agent, Joel Segal, said: \"After the draft, there were two clubs that expressed disappointment and were mad they didn't get him. They were planning to take (Jackson) very high in the third round, and were lamenting the fact that the Vikings beat them\".

===Minnesota Vikings===

====2006 season====
Jackson's 2006 pre-season [[passer rating]] was 106.1, 15th in the league out of 110 quarterbacks who performed. Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.

On September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that. So it's obvious that Brad is still our quarterback so we can stay on that.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Staring at a Quarterback Controversy|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=/nfl/news/ABN4052702.htm|author=Benoit, Andy|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In Week 15, Johnson started the game but was benched in the fourth quarter when the Vikings had been underperforming the entire game losing by a score of 26-7 at the time Jackson went in late in the third quarter against the [[2006 New York Jets|New York Jets]]. Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead. He also threw an interception in the red zone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612170min.htm |title=New York Jets at Minnesota Vikings - December 17th, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Jackson was named the starting quarterback for Minnesota towards the end of his rookie season.  Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass). Jackson had a passer rating of 36.5, had a 50% completion rate (10-20 for 50 yards), one interception, and one fumble.  Packers quarterback Brett Favre only managed a slightly better 52% completion rate (26-50) and threw two interceptions. He threw for 285 yards with no touchdowns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612210gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - December 21st, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2007 season====
Jackson did not live up to the Vikings' expectations in 2007 despite finishing 8-4 as a starter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JackTa00/gamelog/2007/ |title=Tarvaris Jackson 2007 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson had nine touchdowns and 12 interceptions, along with a 159 yards per game, causing the Vikings to have the second-worst passing offense in the NFL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/index.htm |title=2007 NFL Standings & Team Stats |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> His 70.8 passer rating was 28th among NFL quarterbacks.  Jackson missed three games because of injuries, which included a strained groin, a concussion and a fractured index finger. The Vikings failed to make the playoffs.  Analysts put the Vikings' 8-8 record on the successful running of [[Chester Taylor]] and rookie [[Adrian Peterson]], which took the pressure off of Jackson and the defense.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/2007.htm |title=2007 Minnesota Vikings Statistics & Players |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Later in the season, opponents decided to focus all their defensive efforts on stopping Peterson and the Vikings running game, while daring Jackson to beat them in the passing game.  The [[2007 Washington Redskins|Washington Redskins]] successfully utilized five [[defensive lineman]] or four [[linebackers]] against the Vikings, leaving only two or three defensive backs in pass coverage.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225070431/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12791702.html Washington D focuses all its attention on Peterson]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/27/AR2007122702318.html|title=Wrinkles Changed Playoff Complexion|first=Jason|last=Reid|date=December 28, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>  And the 49ers blitzed their [[cornerback]]s 20 percent of the time instead of covering receivers with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12522941.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiU9PmP:QiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU|title=Patrick Reusse: Fans shouldn't go overboard on Jackson yet|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723221658/http://www.wtov9.com/sports/14824511/detail.html Vikings Enjoying Quite A Turnaround]</ref>  On the season's last game against the [[2007 Denver Broncos|Denver Broncos]], Jackson led the Vikings to two fourth quarter drives to tie the game and send it into overtime. In overtime, however, Jackson fumbled on the second play and the Vikings lost the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200712300den.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Denver Broncos - December 30th, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson showed slow improvement over the season: he played a large role when the Vikings went on a five-game winning streak in November, but also showed his inexperience in several ill-judged interceptions, jump passes, and turnovers.  After the season, Childress would not say if Tarvaris Jackson would be the starter in 2008, explaining that he wanted to \"evaluate the total body of work\" first.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226171506/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12806557.html Childress noncommittal over quarterback's long-term future]</ref>

====2008 season====
There was a lot of media coverage on Jackson the summer of 2008. The Vikings returned seven players that were in the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] (only three teams had more), and spent $60 million in guaranteed contract money upgrading their team with [[Jared Allen]], traded from the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and free agents [[Bernard Berrian]] and [[Madieu Williams]]. Several analysts believed better quarterback play was all that was needed to make the Vikings one of the top contending teams in the NFL, and with the [[Green Bay Packers]] losing [[Brett Favre]] the [[NFC North Division]] was up for grabs.  [[Sport's Illustrated]]'s [[Paul Lionel Zimmerman|Paul Zimmerman]] predicted the Vikings would win the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/dr_z/06/20/vikings/index.html|title=Dare I pick Minnesota to win it all?|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Head coach Brad Childress decided to stay with Jackson as the starting quarterback and brought in [[Gus Frerotte]] to be his backup. It was widely reported in the off-season that Jackson had a new swagger, handled situations in practice well where he looked lost in the previous years, and had an improved grasp of the Vikings offensive system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080526142945/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/19160244.html?location_refer=Vikings QB Jackson acting the part]</ref>  Childress threw a \"Coaching 101\" clinic for media reporters in which he played a tape of Jackson showing the progress he made in 2007 through a series of missed passes or poor decisions that he made in early games but executed properly in later contests and concluded with some tape of him hitting a target net with every 15-yard pass he threw during an offseason drill.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014115851/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/coaching_101_clinic.html Coaching 101 clinic]</ref>  Offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] repeatedly told the press that although it was Jackson's third year with the Vikings it was really his second year playing, and NFL quarterbacks improve the most between their first and second years.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080727125711/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/bevell_on_tjack.html Bevell on T-Jack]</ref>  Jackson had another good preseason, until he injured his knee again in the second preseason game which kept him from playing the last two preseason games.

In the first game of the regular season against the [[2008 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]], Jackson threw a game-ending interception and in the second game the Vikings made five field goal attempts and no touchdowns against the [[2008 Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis Colts]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809080gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - September 8th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809140min.htm |title=Indianapolis Colts at Minnesota Vikings - September 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings lost both games by close margins, and Jackson's 64.8 passer rating ranked him 26th in the NFL. Childress said in the second post-game press conference that Jackson would still definitely be the starter next week, but on Monday after a coaches' meeting he changed his mind and benched Jackson for the remainder of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/|title=Official Blog of the National Football League|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>
[[File:20090104 Chester Taylor.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Jackson (7) with the Vikings.]]
After being relegated to backup after the loss to the Colts, Jackson saw his next significant action in Week 14 against [[2008 Detroit Lions|Detroit]], where he played the entire second half in place of an injured [[Gus Frerotte]]. With the Vikings trailing 6-3 at halftime to the winless Lions, Jackson completed eight of ten passes for 105 yards and a touchdown, an 11-yard strike to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]] that would be the game-winning score for the Vikings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2008/12/07/tarvaris-jackson-steps-in-for-gus-frerotte-leads-minnesota-vikings-to-comeback-victory/|title=Tarvaris Jackson steps in for Gus Frerotte, leads Minnesota Vikings to comeback victory – Twin Cities|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>  The following week, with Frerotte still injured, Jackson was the starting quarterback against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals|Arizona Cardinals]] and he played arguably the best game of his career.  Jackson completed 11 of 17 passes for 163 yards and, most impressively, threw four touchdown passes and no interceptions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812140crd.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Arizona Cardinals - December 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance as well as the [[FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air Player of the Week]] award.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2008/week_15.htm |title=2008 NFL Week 15 Leaders & Scores |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

The Vikings lost 24-17 to the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta Falcons]] in Week 16 despite Jackson's performance.  He completed 22 of 36 passes for 233 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.  He also rushed for 76 yards (which matched the total of Pro-Bowl running back [[Adrian Peterson]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812210min.htm |title=Atlanta Falcons at Minnesota Vikings - December 21st, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>  With the Vikings in a win-and-in situation against the [[2008 New York Giants|New York Giants]] in Week 17, Jackson overcame an interception in the end zone by leading the Vikings on a touchdown drive (a 54-yard strike to [[Bernard Berrian]]) and the game-winning field goal drive on the following possessions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812280min.htm |title=New York Giants at Minnesota Vikings - December 28th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings defeated the Giants 20-19 and earned the NFC North title.

The Vikings season ended in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs with a loss to the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagles]].

====2009 season====
Jackson went into the 2009 season in competition for a starting job with [[Sage Rosenfels]], who the Vikings had acquired from the [[Houston Texans]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3939155 |title=Vikings acquire Rosenfels, give QB new contract |date=February 27, 2009 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings also pursued former [[New York Jets]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]], who had retired after the end of the 2008 season. Favre announced that he would not join the Vikings prior to [[training camp]], however, and Jackson and Rosenfels split duties in the early part of camp.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090731104335/http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/The_Trenches/entry/view/28956/vikings_favre_will_stay_retired The Sporting News]</ref> Jackson was the second quarterback to play in the opening preseason game, and was expected to start the second preseason game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballhype.com/article/minnesota_vikings_qb_tarvaris_jackson_gets_chance_to/|title=Home - Future PLC|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

That changed, however, when Favre announced that he would play for the Vikings after all, signing with the team on August 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4406963|title=Purple reign: Indecisive Favre signs with Vikings|date=August 19, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Jackson, Rosenfels, and 2008 third-stringer [[John David Booty]] were believed to be competing for two roster spots, and for the primary backup job.

Jackson helped his case with a strong performance in Favre's debut game against the [[2009 Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City Chiefs]], throwing for 202 yards and two touchdowns in backup work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290821016|title=Chiefs vs. Vikings - Game Recap - August 21, 2009 - ESPN|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Ultimately, the Vikings elected to keep Jackson and Rosenfels on the active roster, with Jackson as the primary backup to Favre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|title=Fantasy Football Forum|accessdate=July 1, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310113848/http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

Jackson entered the Vikings' first two games of the season in [[garbage time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009091304/2009/REG1/vikings@browns|title=Watch Minnesota Vikings vs. Cleveland Browns [09/13/2009] - NFL.com|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/3595/third-and-one-vikings-2|title=Third and one: Vikings|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> He also was used as a decoy in [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] coverage during week two.

====2010 season====
The Vikings re-signed Jackson on Monday, April 19 as they waited for Favre to decide whether he would return for another season, which he did.  Jackson was a restricted free agent who was given a one-year tender worth $1.176 million. Jackson backed up Favre for the 2010 season.

Jackson took over for an injured Favre in Week 8 against the [[2010 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]]. Jackson threw for one touchdown in the loss.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201010310nwe.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at New England Patriots - October 31st, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson took over for an injured Favre yet again in Week 13 against the [[2010 Buffalo Bills|Buffalo Bills]].

On March 3, 2011, the Vikings declined to tender Jackson a contract offer to play for them in the 2011 season. Under league rules, Jackson became an [[unrestricted free agent]].

'''Tarvaris Jackson''' (April 21, 1983 – April 12, 2020) was an [[American football]] [[quarterback]]. Born and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Jackson played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State]], and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].

The Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].

==Early life and college career==
Jackson was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and graduated from [[Sidney Lanier High School]] of Montgomery in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/02/29/montgomery-native-tarvaris-jackson-talks-lanier-alabama-state-football/81114924/ |title=Montgomery native Tarvaris Jackson talks Lanier, ASU football |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson then enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]] and played three games for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team as a freshman but suffered a season-ending injury.

In 2003, after trailing on the depth chart to future first round draft pick [[Matt Jones (wide receiver)|Matt Jones]], Jackson transferred to [[Alabama State University]] and led the [[Alabama State Hornets football|Hornets]] to an 8-5 record, [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] (SWAC) Eastern Division title, and berth in the [[SWAC Championship Game]].<ref name=\"Seahawks bio\"/> He completed 160 of 316 passes for 2,342 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions and rushed 444 yards on 91 carries including 5 touchdowns.<ref name=\"CBS draft\">{{cite web|author=NFLDraftScout.com|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/historical/1107218|title=Tarvaris Jackson Player Profile|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}</ref> As a junior in 2004, Jackson won SWAC Championship MVP in Alabama State's second 10-win season in school history.<ref name=\"Seahawks bio\"/> With 11 starts in 12 games, Jackson passed for 2,556 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions.

Vikings scouts and personnel had reportedly been watching him closely in secret over his senior season, particularly liking his performance in the [[East-West Shrine Game]]. They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected. On July 26, 2006, Jackson signed a four-year deal with Minnesota, including a $1 million signing bonus.<ref>\"[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/football/060726/f072680.html Vikings sign quarterback Tarvaris Jackson to four-year contract]\". Originally published on July 26, 2006. Retrieved on April 16, 2007.</ref>

Vikings coach [[Brad Childress]] was quoted days before the draft as saying he was interested in finding a \"developmental guy\", a \"diamond in the rough\" quarterback of the future, raw talent he could teach a system.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070318124007/http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=FBN-VIKINGS-04-26-06 Childress Quotes before draft]. Childress quotes before the draft.</ref> Both new coach Childress and Vikings former quarterback [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] had had success developing quarterbacks in the past, including [[A. J. Feeley]] and [[Donovan McNabb]].

The day after the draft, Childress was quoted by the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' as saying: \"I think you judge quarterbacks a little bit differently...When you see what you want at the quarterback position, you need to go get it. And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach. So what can he do with coaching?\"<ref>\"That's a good question,\" many people reply, noting that Jackson is Seattle's only Black Mormon.  [http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html Childress Quotes after draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828071130/http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html |date=August 28, 2006 }}.</ref> Jackson's agent, Joel Segal, said: \"After the draft, there were two clubs that expressed disappointment and were mad they didn't get him. They were planning to take (Jackson) very high in the third round, and were lamenting the fact that the Vikings beat them\".

===Minnesota Vikings===

====2006 season====
Jackson's 2006 pre-season [[passer rating]] was 106.1, 15th in the league out of 110 quarterbacks who performed. Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.

On September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that. So it's obvious that Brad is still our quarterback so we can stay on that.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Staring at a Quarterback Controversy|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=/nfl/news/ABN4052702.htm|author=Benoit, Andy|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In Week 15, Johnson started the game but was benched in the fourth quarter when the Vikings had been underperforming the entire game losing by a score of 26-7 at the time Jackson went in late in the third quarter against the [[2006 New York Jets|New York Jets]]. Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead. He also threw an interception in the red zone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612170min.htm |title=New York Jets at Minnesota Vikings - December 17th, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Jackson was named the starting quarterback for Minnesota towards the end of his rookie season.  Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass). Jackson had a passer rating of 36.5, had a 50% completion rate (10-20 for 50 yards), one interception, and one fumble.  Packers quarterback Brett Favre only managed a slightly better 52% completion rate (26-50) and threw two interceptions.

Jackson did not live up to the Vikings' expectations in 2007 despite finishing 8-4 as a starter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JackTa00/gamelog/2007/ |title=Tarvaris Jackson 2007 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson had nine touchdowns and 12 interceptions, along with a 159 yards per game, causing the Vikings to have the second-worst passing offense in the NFL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/index.htm |title=2007 NFL Standings & Team Stats |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> His 70.8 passer rating was 28th among NFL quarterbacks.  Jackson missed three games because of injuries, which included a strained groin, a concussion and a fractured index finger. The Vikings failed to make the playoffs.  Analysts put the Vikings' 8-8 record on the successful running of [[Chester Taylor]] and rookie [[Adrian Peterson]], which took the pressure off of Jackson and the defense.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/2007.htm |title=2007 Minnesota Vikings Statistics & Players |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

Later in the season, opponents decided to focus all their defensive efforts on stopping Peterson and the Vikings running game, while daring Jackson to beat them in the passing game.  The [[2007 Washington Redskins|Washington Redskins]] successfully utilized five [[defensive lineman]] or four [[linebackers]] against the Vikings, leaving only two or three defensive backs in pass coverage.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225070431/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12791702.html Washington D focuses all its attention on Peterson]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/27/AR2007122702318.html|title=Wrinkles Changed Playoff Complexion|first=Jason|last=Reid|date=December 28, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>  And the 49ers blitzed their [[cornerback]]s 20 percent of the time instead of covering receivers with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12522941.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiU9PmP:QiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU|title=Patrick Reusse: Fans shouldn't go overboard on Jackson yet|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723221658/http://www.wtov9.com/sports/14824511/detail.html Vikings Enjoying Quite A Turnaround]</ref>  On the season's last game against the [[2007 Denver Broncos|Denver Broncos]], Jackson led the Vikings to two fourth quarter drives to tie the game and send it into overtime. In overtime, however, Jackson fumbled on the second play and the Vikings lost the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200712300den.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Denver Broncos - December 30th, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson showed slow improvement over the season: he played a large role when the Vikings went on a five-game winning streak in November, but also showed his inexperience in several ill-judged interceptions, jump passes, and turnovers.  After the season, Childress would not say if Tarvaris Jackson would be the starter in 2008, explaining that he wanted to \"evaluate the total body of work\" first.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226171506/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/12806557.html Childress noncommittal over quarterback's long-term future]</ref>

====2008 season====
There was a lot of media coverage on Jackson the summer of 2008. The Vikings returned seven players that were in the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] (only three teams had more), and spent $60 million in guaranteed contract money upgrading their team with [[Jared Allen]], traded from the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and free agents [[Bernard Berrian]] and [[Madieu Williams]]. Several analysts believed better quarterback play was all that was needed to make the Vikings one of the top contending teams in the NFL, and with the [[Green Bay Packers]] losing [[Brett Favre]] the [[NFC North Division]] was up for grabs.  [[Sport's Illustrated]]'s [[Paul Lionel Zimmerman|Paul Zimmerman]] predicted the Vikings would win the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/dr_z/06/20/vikings/index.html|title=Dare I pick Minnesota to win it all?|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Head coach Brad Childress decided to stay with Jackson as the starting quarterback and brought in [[Gus Frerotte]] to be his backup. It was widely reported in the off-season that Jackson had a new swagger, handled situations in practice well where he looked lost in the previous years, and had an improved grasp of the Vikings offensive system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080526142945/http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/19160244.html?location_refer=Vikings QB Jackson acting the part]</ref>  Childress threw a \"Coaching 101\" clinic for media reporters in which he played a tape of Jackson showing the progress he made in 2007 through a series of missed passes or poor decisions that he made in early games but executed properly in later contests and concluded with some tape of him hitting a target net with every 15-yard pass he threw during an offseason drill.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014115851/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/coaching_101_clinic.html Coaching 101 clinic]</ref>  Offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] repeatedly told the press that although it was Jackson's third year with the Vikings it was really his second year playing, and NFL quarterbacks improve the most between their first and second years.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080727125711/http://blogs.twincities.com/Vikings/2008/05/bevell_on_tjack.html Bevell on T-Jack]</ref>  Jackson had another good preseason, until he injured his knee again in the second preseason game which kept him from playing the last two preseason games.

In the first game of the regular season against the [[2008 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]], Jackson threw a game-ending interception and in the second game the Vikings made five field goal attempts and no touchdowns against the [[2008 Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis Colts]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809080gnb.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers - September 8th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809140min.htm |title=Indianapolis Colts at Minnesota Vikings - September 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings lost both games by close margins, and Jackson's 64.8 passer rating ranked him 26th in the NFL. Childress said in the second post-game press conference that Jackson would still definitely be the starter next week, but on Monday after a coaches' meeting he changed his mind and benched Jackson for the remainder of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/|title=Official Blog of the National Football League|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>
[[File:20090104 Chester Taylor.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Jackson (7) with the Vikings.]]
After being relegated to backup after the loss to the Colts, Jackson saw his next significant action in Week 14 against [[2008 Detroit Lions|Detroit]], where he played the entire second half in place of an injured [[Gus Frerotte]]. With the Vikings trailing 6-3 at halftime to the winless Lions, Jackson completed eight of ten passes for 105 yards and a touchdown, an 11-yard strike to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]] that would be the game-winning score for the Vikings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2008/12/07/tarvaris-jackson-steps-in-for-gus-frerotte-leads-minnesota-vikings-to-comeback-victory/|title=Tarvaris Jackson steps in for Gus Frerotte, leads Minnesota Vikings to comeback victory – Twin Cities|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>  The following week, with Frerotte still injured, Jackson was the starting quarterback against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals|Arizona Cardinals]] and he played arguably the best game of his career.  Jackson completed 11 of 17 passes for 163 yards and, most impressively, threw four touchdown passes and no interceptions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812140crd.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at Arizona Cardinals - December 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance as well as the [[FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air Player of the Week]] award.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2008/week_15.htm |title=2008 NFL Week 15 Leaders & Scores |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

The Vikings lost 24-17 to the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta Falcons]] in Week 16 despite Jackson's performance.  He completed 22 of 36 passes for 233 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.  He also rushed for 76 yards (which matched the total of Pro-Bowl running back [[Adrian Peterson]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812210min.htm |title=Atlanta Falcons at Minnesota Vikings - December 21st, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>  With the Vikings in a win-and-in situation against the [[2008 New York Giants|New York Giants]] in Week 17, Jackson overcame an interception in the end zone by leading the Vikings on a touchdown drive (a 54-yard strike to [[Bernard Berrian]]) and the game-winning field goal drive on the following possessions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200812280min.htm |title=New York Giants at Minnesota Vikings - December 28th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings defeated the Giants 20-19 and earned the NFC North title.

The Vikings season ended in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs with a loss to the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia Eagles]]. Jackson went 15-for-35 for 164 yards in the game with one interception.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200901040min.htm |title=Wild Card - Philadelphia Eagles at Minnesota Vikings - January 4th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

====2009 season====
Jackson went into the 2009 season in competition for a starting job with [[Sage Rosenfels]], who the Vikings had acquired from the [[Houston Texans]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3939155 |title=Vikings acquire Rosenfels, give QB new contract |date=February 27, 2009 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The Vikings also pursued former [[New York Jets]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]], who had retired after the end of the 2008 season. Favre announced that he would not join the Vikings prior to [[training camp]], however, and Jackson and Rosenfels split duties in the early part of camp.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090731104335/http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/The_Trenches/entry/view/28956/vikings_favre_will_stay_retired The Sporting News]</ref> Jackson was the second quarterback to play in the opening preseason game, and was expected to start the second preseason game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballhype.com/article/minnesota_vikings_qb_tarvaris_jackson_gets_chance_to/|title=Home - Future PLC|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

That changed, however, when Favre announced that he would play for the Vikings after all, signing with the team on August 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4406963|title=Purple reign: Indecisive Favre signs with Vikings|date=August 19, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Jackson, Rosenfels, and 2008 third-stringer [[John David Booty]] were believed to be competing for two roster spots, and for the primary backup job. Many observers believed the Vikings would attempt to trade Jackson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/240097-with-favre-on-board-who-will-be-the-odd-man-out|title=With Favre on Board, Who Will Be the Odd Man Out?|first=Brett|last=Stott|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

Jackson helped his case with a strong performance in Favre's debut game against the [[2009 Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City Chiefs]], throwing for 202 yards and two touchdowns in backup work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290821016|title=Chiefs vs. Vikings - Game Recap - August 21, 2009 - ESPN|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> Ultimately, the Vikings elected to keep Jackson and Rosenfels on the active roster, with Jackson as the primary backup to Favre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|title=Fantasy Football Forum|accessdate=July 1, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310113848/http://gridironfans.com/forums/latest-nfl-headlines/107377-vikings-qb-tarvaris-jackson-backup-vs-cleveland.html|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

Jackson entered the Vikings' first two games of the season in [[garbage time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009091304/2009/REG1/vikings@browns|title=Watch Minnesota Vikings vs. Cleveland Browns [09/13/2009] - NFL.com|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/3595/third-and-one-vikings-2|title=Third and one: Vikings|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> He also was used as a decoy in [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] coverage during week two.

====2010 season====
The Vikings re-signed Jackson on Monday, April 19 as they waited for Favre to decide whether he would return for another season, which he did.  Jackson was a restricted free agent who was given a one-year tender worth $1.176 million. Jackson backed up Favre for the 2010 season.

Jackson took over for an injured Favre in Week 8 against the [[2010 New England Patriots|New England Patriots]]. Jackson threw for one touchdown in the loss.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201010310nwe.htm |title=Minnesota Vikings at New England Patriots - October 31st, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson took over for an injured Favre yet again in Week 13 against the [[2010 Buffalo Bills|Buffalo Bills]].

On March 3, 2011, the Vikings declined to tender Jackson a contract offer to play for them in the 2011 season. Under league rules, Jackson became an [[unrestricted free agent]].

===Seattle Seahawks===
