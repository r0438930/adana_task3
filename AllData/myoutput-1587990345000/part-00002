{"title_page": "Prophecy of the Popes", "text_new": "{{short description|Series of 112 short, cryptic phrases in Latin which purport to predict the Roman Catholic popes}}\n[[File:Arnoldo Wion 1595 Lignum Vitae p311.GIF|300px|thumb|Final part of the prophecies in ''Lignum Vit\u00e6'' (1595), p. 311]]\nThe '''Prophecy of the Popes''' ({{lang-la|Prophetia Sancti Malachiae Archiepiscopi, de Summis Pontificibus}}) is a series of 112 short, cryptic phrases in [[Latin (language)|Latin]] which purport to predict the [[Roman Catholic]] [[pope]]s (along with a few [[antipope]]s), beginning with [[Celestine II]]. It was first published by [[Benedictine]] monk [[Arnold de Wyon|Arnold Wion]] in 1595. Wion attributes the prophecy to [[Saint Malachy]], a 12th-century [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|archbishop of Armagh]].\n\nGiven the very accurate description of popes up to around 1590 and lack of accuracy for the popes that follow, historians generally conclude that the alleged prophecy is a fabrication written shortly before publication. The [[Catholic Church]] has no official stance, though some Catholic theologians have dismissed it as [[forgery]].<ref name=\"Sieczkowski\" /><ref name=\"Boyle\" />\n\nThe prophecy concludes with a pope identified as \"Peter the Roman\", whose pontificate will allegedly precede the destruction of the city of [[Rome]].<ref name=Walker/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Malachy.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Saint Malachy]] (1094\u20131148), to whom Wion attributes the authorship of the prophecies. Malachy died over four centuries before the prophecies first appeared.]]\nThe alleged prophecy was first published in 1595 by a Benedictine named Arnold Wion in his ''Lignum Vit\u00e6'', a history of the Benedictine order. He attributed it to [[Saint Malachy]], the 12th\u2011century [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]]. He explained that the prophecy had not, to his knowledge, ever been printed before, but that many were eager to see it. Wion includes both the alleged original prophecy, consisting of short, cryptic Latin phrases, as well as an interpretation applying the statements to historical popes up to [[Urban VII]] (pope for thirteen days in 1590), which Wion attributes to [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]],<ref>O'Brien 1880, pp. 16 & 25.</ref> an attribution which was [[Alphonsus Ciacconius#Prophecy of the Popes controversy|refuted]] by [[Claude-Fran\u00e7ois Menestrier]] in 1694.<ref>Menestrier 1694, pp. 343\u2013344.</ref>\n\nAccording to an account put forward in 1871 by Abb\u00e9 Cucherat, Malachy was summoned to Rome in 1139 by [[Pope Innocent II]] to receive two wool [[pallium]]s for the metropolitan sees of [[Armagh]] and [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]]. While in Rome, Malachy purportedly experienced a vision of future popes, which he recorded as a sequence of cryptic phrases. This manuscript was then deposited in the [[Vatican Secret Archives]], and forgotten about until its rediscovery in 1590, supposedly just in time for a [[papal conclave]] occurring at the time.<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\">Catholic Encyclopedia 1913, \"Prophecy\".</ref>\n\n[[Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]], a contemporary biographer of Malachy who recorded the saint's alleged miracles, makes no mention of the prophecy.<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\" /> The earliest known reference to them dates to 1587.<ref>Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 738.</ref>\n\nSeveral historians have concluded that the prophecy is a late 16th\u2011century [[forgery]].<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\" /><ref name=\"Brien\">O'Brien 1880, p. 110.</ref><ref>de Vallemont 1708, p. 87.</ref> Spanish monk and scholar [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro]] wrote in his ''Teatro Cr\u00edtico Universal'' (1724\u20131739), in an entry called ''Purported prophecies'', that the high level of accuracy of the verses up until the date they were published, compared with their high level of inaccuracy after that date, is evidence that they were created around the time of publication.<ref>Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro 1724\u20131739, p. 129.</ref> The verses and explanations given in Wion correspond very closely to a 1557 history of the popes by [[Onofrio Panvinio]] (including replication of errors made by Panvinio), which may indicate that the prophecy was written based on that source.<ref>O'Brien 1880, p. 14.</ref>\n\nOne theory to explain the prophecy's creation, put forward by 17th-century French priest and encyclopaedist [[Louis Mor\u00e9ri]], among others, is that it was spread by supporters of Cardinal [[Girolamo Simoncelli]] in support of his bid to become pope during the 1590 conclave to replace Urban VII. In the prophecy, the pope following Urban VII is given the description \"''Ex antiquitate Urbis''\" (\"from the old city\"), and Simoncelli was from Orvieto, which in Latin is ''Urbevetanum'', old city. Mor\u00e9ri and others proposed the prophecy was created in an unsuccessful attempt to demonstrate that Simoncelli was destined to be pope.<ref>O'Brien 1880, p. 85.</ref>\n\nHowever, the discovery of a reference to the prophecy in a 1587 letter has cast doubt on this theory. In this document the entourage of the Cardinal [[Gian Girolamo Albani|Giovanni Girolamo Albani]] interprets the motto \"''De rore coeli''\" (\"From the dew of the sky\") as a reference to their master, on the base of the link between \"''alba''\" (\"dawn\") and Albani, and the dew, as a typical morning atmospheric phenomenon.<ref name=\"Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 737\">Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 737.</ref>\n\n==Interpretation==\n[[File:Caelestinus II.jpg|thumb|[[Celestine II]] (d. 1144), the first pope mentioned in the prophecies.]]\nThe interpretation of the entries for pre-publication popes provided by Wion involves close correspondences between the mottos and the popes' birthplaces, family names, [[heraldry|personal arms]], and pre-papal titles. For example, the first motto, ''Ex castro Tiberis'' (from a castle on the Tiber), fits [[Celestine II]]'s birthplace in [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], on the [[Tiber]].\n\nEfforts to connect the prophecy to historical popes who were elected after its publication have been more strained.<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\" /><ref name=\"Brien\" /><ref>Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro 1724\u20131739, p. 134.</ref> For example, [[Clement XIII]] is referred to as ''Rosa Umbriae'' (the rose of Umbria), but was not from Umbria nor had any but the most marginal connection with the region, having been briefly pontifical governor of [[Rieti]], at the time part of Umbria.\n\nOne writer notes that among the post-publication (post-1595) popes there remain \"some surprisingly appropriate phrases\", while adding that \"it is of course easy to exaggerate the list's accuracy by simply citing its successes\", and that \"other tags do not fit so neatly\".<ref name=\"Allan\">Allan 2009, pp. 58\u201359.</ref> Among the reported \"successes\" are \"Religion depopulated\" for [[Benedict XV]] (1914\u201322) whose papacy included [[World War One]] and the [[atheistic]] [[communist]] [[Russian Revolution]]; \"Light in the sky\" for [[Leo XIII]] (1878\u20131903), with a comet in his coat of arms; and \"Flower of flowers\" for [[Paul VI]] (1963\u201378), with fleur-de-lys in his coat of arms.<ref name=\"Allan\" />\n\n[[Peter Bander van Duren|Peter Bander]], then Head of Religious Education at [[Wall Hall]] teacher training college, wrote in 1969:\n{{Quote|If we were to place the works of those who have repudiated the Prophecies of Malachy on scales and balance them against those who have accepted them, we would probably reach a fair equilibrium; however, the most important factor, namely the popularity of the prophecies, particularly among the ordinary people (as distinct from scholars), makes them as relevant to the second half of the twentieth century as they have ever been.|Bander 1969, p. 10.}}\n\nM. J. O'Brien, a Catholic priest who authored an 1880 monograph on the prophecy, provided a more scathing assessment:\n{{Quote|These prophecies have served no purpose. They are absolutely meaningless. The Latin is bad. It is impossible to attribute such absurd triflings ... to any holy source. Those who have written in defence of the prophecy ... have brought forward scarcely an argument in their favour. Their attempts at explaining the prophecies after 1590 are, I say with all respect, the sorriest trifling.|O'Brien 1880, p. 110.}}\n\nMore recently, [[Thomas J. Reese]], SJ, of Georgetown University said, \u201cSt. Malachy\u2019s prophecy is nonsense.\u201d<ref>[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/st-malachy-last-pope-prophecy-theologians-prediction_n_2679662 Sieczkowski, Cavan. \"St. Malachy Last Pope Prophecy: What Theologians Think About 12th-Century Prediction\", HuffPost.com, Dec 06, 2017]</ref>\n\n===''Petrus Romanus''===\nIn recent times, some interpreters of prophetic literature have drawn attention to the prophecy due to its imminent conclusion; if the list of descriptions is matched on a one-to-one basis to the list of historic popes since publication, [[Benedict XVI]] (2005\u201313) would correspond to the second to last of the papal descriptions, ''Gloria olivae'' (the glory of the olive).<ref name=\"Allan\" />\nThe longest and final verse predicts the [[Apocalypse]]:<ref name=ibtimes/>\n\n{{quote|In persecutione extrema S.R.E. sedebit.\n\n[[Petrus Romanus]], qui pascet oves in multis tribulationibus, quibus transactis civitas septicollis diruetur, & judex tremendus judicabit populum suum.

The End.<ref name=\"See\">See, e.g. Bander 1969, p. 96.</ref>}}\n\nSeveral historians and interpreters note the prophecy leaves open the possibility of unlisted popes between \"the glory of the olive\" and the final pope, \"Peter the Roman\".<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\" /><ref name=\"Brien_s\">O'Brien 1880, p. 82.</ref> In the ''Lignum Vitae'', the line ''In persecutione extrema S.R.E. sedebit.'' forms a separate sentence and paragraph of its own. While often read as part of the \"Peter the Roman\" entry, other interpreters view it as a separate, incomplete sentence explicitly referring to one or more popes between \"the glory of the olive\" and \"Peter the Roman\".<ref name=\"Sieczkowski\">Sieczkowski 2013.</ref>\n\n==Popes and corresponding mottos==\n\nThe list can be divided into two groups; one of the popes and antipopes who reigned prior to the appearance of the prophecy c. 1590, for whom the connection between the motto and the pope is consistently clear. The other is of mottos attributed to popes who have reigned since its appearance, for whom the connection between the motto and the pope is often strained or totally absent and could be viewed as [[shoehorning]] or [[postdiction]].\n\nThe list has most commonly been divided between mottos 74 and 75, based on the mottos that were explained by Wion and those that were not. Lorenzo Comensoli Antonini divides the list between mottos 73 and 74, based on the loose connection between [[Urban VII]] and the motto \"From the dew of the sky\", and the reference to the prophecy in a 1587 letter, prior to Urban VII's papacy.<ref name=\"Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 737\"/>\n\nRen\u00e9 Thibaut divides the table at a different point, between the 71st and 72nd motto, asserting that there is a change in style at this point. He uses this distinction to put forward the view that the first 71 mottos are post-dated forgeries, while the remainder are genuine.<ref name=\"Thibaut\">Ren\u00e9 Thibaut S. J.: La myst\u00e9rieuse proph\u00e9tie des Papes. Namur-Paris, 1951, p. 10.</ref> Hildebrand Troll echoes this view, noting that mottos 72\u2013112 use a symbolic language related to the character of the pope and his papacy, in contrast to the more literal mottos for earlier popes.<ref name=\"Troll\">Hildebrand Troll: ''Die Papstweissagung des heiligen Malachias.

It was first published by [[Benedictine]] monk [[Arnold de Wyon|Arnold Wion]] in 1595. Wion attributes the prophecy to [[Saint Malachy]], a 12th-century [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|archbishop of Armagh]].\n\nGiven the very accurate description of popes up to around 1590 and lack of accuracy for the popes that follow, historians generally conclude that the alleged prophecy is a fabrication written shortly before publication. The [[Catholic Church]] has no official stance, though some Catholic theologians have dismissed it as [[forgery]].<ref name=\"Sieczkowski\" /><ref name=\"Boyle\" />\n\nThe prophecy concludes with a pope identified as \"Peter the Roman\", whose pontificate will allegedly precede the destruction of the city of [[Rome]].<ref name=Walker/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Malachy.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Saint Malachy]] (1094\u20131148), to whom Wion attributes the authorship of the prophecies. Malachy died over four centuries before the prophecies first appeared.]]\nThe alleged prophecy was first published in 1595 by a Benedictine named Arnold Wion in his ''Lignum Vit\u00e6'', a history of the Benedictine order. He attributed it to [[Saint Malachy]], the 12th\u2011century [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]]. He explained that the prophecy had not, to his knowledge, ever been printed before, but that many were eager to see it. Wion includes both the alleged original prophecy, consisting of short, cryptic Latin phrases, as well as an interpretation applying the statements to historical popes up to [[Urban VII]] (pope for thirteen days in 1590), which Wion attributes to [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]],<ref>O'Brien 1880, pp. 16 & 25.</ref> an attribution which was [[Alphonsus Ciacconius#Prophecy of the Popes controversy|refuted]] by [[Claude-Fran\u00e7ois Menestrier]] in 1694.<ref>Menestrier 1694, pp. 343\u2013344.</ref>\n\nAccording to an account put forward in 1871 by Abb\u00e9 Cucherat, Malachy was summoned to Rome in 1139 by [[Pope Innocent II]] to receive two wool [[pallium]]s for the metropolitan sees of [[Armagh]] and [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]]. While in Rome, Malachy purportedly experienced a vision of future popes, which he recorded as a sequence of cryptic phrases. This manuscript was then deposited in the [[Vatican Secret Archives]], and forgotten about until its rediscovery in 1590, supposedly just in time for a [[papal conclave]] occurring at the time.<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\">Catholic Encyclopedia 1913, \"Prophecy\".</ref>\n\n[[Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]], a contemporary biographer of Malachy who recorded the saint's alleged miracles, makes no mention of the prophecy.<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\" /> The earliest known reference to them dates to 1587.<ref>Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 738.</ref>\n\nSeveral historians have concluded that the prophecy is a late 16th\u2011century [[forgery]].<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\" /><ref name=\"Brien\">O'Brien 1880, p. 110.</ref><ref>de Vallemont 1708, p. 87.</ref> Spanish monk and scholar [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro]] wrote in his ''Teatro Cr\u00edtico Universal'' (1724\u20131739), in an entry called ''Purported prophecies'', that the high level of accuracy of the verses up until the date they were published, compared with their high level of inaccuracy after that date, is evidence that they were created around the time of publication.<ref>Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro 1724\u20131739, p. 129.</ref> The verses and explanations given in Wion correspond very closely to a 1557 history of the popes by [[Onofrio Panvinio]] (including replication of errors made by Panvinio), which may indicate that the prophecy was written based on that source.<ref>O'Brien 1880, p. 14.</ref>\n\nOne theory to explain the prophecy's creation, put forward by 17th-century French priest and encyclopaedist [[Louis Mor\u00e9ri]], among others,  is that it was spread by supporters of Cardinal [[Girolamo Simoncelli]] in support of his bid to become pope during the 1590 conclave to replace Urban VII. In the prophecy, the pope following Urban VII is given the description \"''Ex antiquitate Urbis''\" (\"from the old city\"), and Simoncelli was from Orvieto, which in Latin is ''Urbevetanum'', old city. Mor\u00e9ri and others proposed the prophecy was created in an unsuccessful attempt to demonstrate that Simoncelli was destined to be pope.<ref>O'Brien 1880, p. 85.</ref>\n\nHowever, the discovery of a reference to the prophecy in a 1587 letter has cast doubt on this theory. In this document the entourage of the Cardinal [[Gian Girolamo Albani|Giovanni Girolamo Albani]]  interprets the motto \"''De rore coeli''\" (\"From the dew of the sky\") as a reference to their master, on the base of the link between \"''alba''\" (\"dawn\") and Albani, and the dew, as a typical morning atmospheric phenomenon.<ref name=\"Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 737\">Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 737.</ref>\n\n==Interpretation==\n[[File:Caelestinus II.jpg|thumb|[[Celestine II]] (d. 1144), the first pope mentioned in the prophecies.]]\nThe interpretation of the entries for pre-publication popes provided by Wion involves close correspondences between the mottos and the popes' birthplaces, family names, [[heraldry|personal arms]], and pre-papal titles. For example, the first motto, ''Ex castro Tiberis'' (from a castle on the Tiber), fits [[Celestine II]]'s birthplace in [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], on the [[Tiber]].\n\nEfforts to connect the prophecy to historical popes who were elected after its publication have been more strained.<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\" /><ref name=\"Brien\" /><ref>Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro 1724\u20131739, p. 134.</ref> For example, [[Clement XIII]] is referred to as ''Rosa Umbriae'' (the rose of Umbria), but was not from Umbria nor had any but the most marginal connection with the region, having been briefly pontifical governor of [[Rieti]], at the time part of Umbria.\n\nOne writer notes that among the post-publication (post-1595) popes there remain \"some surprisingly appropriate phrases\", while adding that \"it is of course easy to exaggerate the list's accuracy by simply citing its successes\", and that \"other tags do not fit so neatly\".<ref name=\"Allan\">Allan 2009, pp. 58\u201359.</ref>  Among the reported \"successes\" are \"Religion depopulated\" for [[Benedict XV]] (1914\u201322) whose papacy included [[World War One]] and the [[atheistic]] [[communist]] [[Russian Revolution]]; \"Light in the sky\" for [[Leo XIII]] (1878\u20131903), with a comet in his coat of arms; and \"Flower of flowers\" for [[Paul VI]] (1963\u201378), with fleur-de-lys in his coat of arms.<ref name=\"Allan\" />\n\n[[Peter Bander van Duren|Peter Bander]], then Head of Religious Education at [[Wall Hall]] teacher training college, wrote in 1969:\n{{Quote|If we were to place the works of those who have repudiated the Prophecies of Malachy on scales and balance them against those who have accepted them, we would probably reach a fair equilibrium; however, the most important factor, namely the popularity of the prophecies, particularly among the ordinary people (as distinct from scholars), makes them as relevant to the second half of the twentieth century as they have ever been.|Bander 1969, p. 10.}}\n\nM. J. O'Brien, a Catholic priest who authored an 1880 monograph on the prophecy, provided a more scathing assessment:\n{{Quote|These prophecies have served no purpose. They are absolutely meaningless. The Latin is bad. It is impossible to attribute such absurd triflings ... to any holy source. Those who have written in defence of the prophecy ... have brought forward scarcely an argument in their favour. Their attempts at explaining the prophecies after 1590 are, I say with all respect, the sorriest trifling.|O'Brien 1880, p. 110.}}\n\nMore recently, [[Thomas J.

The End.<ref name=\"See\">See, e.g. Bander 1969, p. 96.</ref>}}\n\nSeveral historians and interpreters note the prophecy leaves open the possibility of unlisted popes between \"the glory of the olive\" and the final pope, \"Peter the Roman\".<ref name=\"CatholicEncyclopedia\" /><ref name=\"Brien_s\">O'Brien 1880, p. 82.</ref> In the ''Lignum Vitae'', the line ''In persecutione extrema S.R.E. sedebit.'' forms a separate sentence and paragraph of its own. While often read as part of the \"Peter the Roman\" entry, other interpreters view it as a separate, incomplete sentence explicitly referring to one or more popes between \"the glory of the olive\" and \"Peter the Roman\".<ref name=\"Sieczkowski\">Sieczkowski 2013.</ref>\n\n==Popes and corresponding mottos==\n\nThe list can be divided into two groups; one of the popes and antipopes who reigned prior to the appearance of the prophecy c. 1590, for whom the connection between the motto and the pope is consistently clear. The other is of mottos attributed to popes who have reigned since its appearance, for whom the connection between the motto and the pope is often strained or totally absent and could be viewed as [[shoehorning]] or [[postdiction]].\n\nThe list has most commonly been divided between mottos 74 and 75, based on the mottos that were explained by Wion and those that were not. Lorenzo Comensoli Antonini divides the list between mottos 73 and 74, based on the loose connection between [[Urban VII]] and the motto \"From the dew of the sky\", and the reference to the prophecy in a 1587 letter, prior to Urban VII's papacy.<ref name=\"Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 737\"/>\n\nRen\u00e9 Thibaut divides the table at a different point, between the 71st and 72nd motto, asserting that there is a change in style at this point. He uses this distinction to put forward the view that the first 71 mottos are post-dated forgeries, while the remainder are genuine.<ref name=\"Thibaut\">Ren\u00e9 Thibaut S. J.: La myst\u00e9rieuse proph\u00e9tie des Papes.
