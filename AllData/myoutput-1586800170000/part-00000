Gladstone paid little attention to military affairs but he was keen on efficiency. In 1870, he pushed through Parliament major changes in Army organisation. [[Germany|Germany's]] stunning triumph over [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions|France]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] proved that the Prussian system of professional soldiers with up-to-date weapons was far superior to the traditional system of gentlemen-soldiers that Britain used. Under Cardwell's localisation scheme, the country was divided into 66 Brigade Districts (later renamed Regimental Districts), based on county boundaries and population density. But, there were limitations to the extent that localisation could be implemented.\n\nOne of these 'brigade districts' was No.58 which maintained a brigade depot in [[Stirling]] which covered the counties of; [[Kinross-shire]], [[Clackmannanshire]], [[Stirlingshire]], '''[[Dumbartonshire]]''', [[Argyllshire]], [[Buteshire]], and [[Renfrewshire]]. No.58 brigade district was linked with two well known Scottish regiments; [[72nd (Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]] and the [[91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]]. Within this brigade, the militia and volunteers of these counties were grouped as to provide a simple 'organisational system' of control.<ref name=\":62\" /><ref>T.F.

For some time, the new commanding officer of the corps in 1881 ([[Lieutenant Colonel]] Commandant, H. Currier) was not satisfied with the conduct of the 'Luss Volunteers'. When the 1st Dumbartonshire RVC was called upon for the royal review in 1881, the company was not invited and told to 'remain at home' due to their dress because the commandant thought they 'spoilt the corp's reputation and style'. In typical Scottish style, the corps instead embarked for [[Edinburgh]] to arrive and march with another corps right next to the Dumbartonshire RVC in direct defiance of the commandant. This is one of the reasons why this company was later disbanded and reformed in [[Renton, West Dunbartonshire|Renton]] on 12 February 1882. ''(see uniform notes)''<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />\n\n==== Regimentation ====\nOn 7 January 1881 following the [[Cardwell Reforms]], the corps was attached to [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Princess Louises's Regiment (The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)]], due to location of recruitment, of which [[Dunbartonshire]] fell within. The battalion (as it was now referred to as) was entitled to wear the uniform and badges of the regiment, although it insisted in retaining the elephant and castle emblem in the Argyll badge. After moving under control of the Argylls, the battalion was in-fact ''not'' re-titled as the 6th (Dumbartonshire) Volunteer Btn, but instead referred to as the ''[6th Volunteer Btn]'' 1st Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps. In 1884, 'L' company based in [[Cumbernauld]] was reduced to a detachment in 'K' Company, and a new 'L' company was raised on 1 April 1884 in [[Yoker]]. In 1900 just before the battalion sent volunteers to [[South Africa]], the battalion formed two specialist companies 'O' (Mounted) in [[Maryhill]] and 'Q' (Cyclists) in [[Dumbarton]]. In 1891, the corps had a small name to change to become the '''1st Dumbartonshire Volunteer Rifle Corps'''. The years 1881-1908 saw a marked improvement in the organisation, training and equipment of the local volunteers as the government attempted to increase the fighting value of these forces. Funding in the form of grants to the units was considerably improved as well as the financial position of the volunteers.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />\n\n==== South African War ====\n[[File:Boer_War_Memorial,_Stirling_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_192295.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boer_War_Memorial,_Stirling_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_192295.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Argyll and Sutherland's Boer War Memorial at Stirling Castle]]\nDuring the [[South African War]] the battalion contributed 98 of its members to the various new formations.

One man joined the [[Scottish Cyclist Company]], and 29 men the [[Imperial Yeomanry]], of whom private Nielson died of disease [[Captain]] R. L.

The battalion had a central rife-range at [[Auchin-carroch]], in the [[Vale of Leven]], up to 900 yards, and A, I, and K Companies had also ranged near their headquarters, that of the latter being held in conjunction with E Company, 4th Volunteer Battalion.

In his 'Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill', Mr Haldane set up an establishment of fourteen divisions (infantry), fourteen mounted brigades (yeomanry), army troops, and troops for coastal defence. These to be raised and administered locally by a number of Territorial Force Associations. Under these reforms, the structure of infantry units were also altered, with each containing a peace establishment of 1,009 of all ranks in 8 companies 'A' to 'H', all under command of a [[Lieutenant Colonel]].<ref>Westlake, The Territorials, Introduction and p. 2.</ref><ref>Westlake, Men-at-Arms, p. 3.</ref>\n\n=== Prewar ===\n[[File:Argyll_&_Sutherland_Highlanders_recruiting_poster_1914.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Argyll_&_Sutherland_Highlanders_recruiting_poster_1914.jpg|alt=|thumb|A 1914 recruiting poster for the Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders]]\nWhen the [[Territorial Force]] was formed, the corps was transferred and redesignated as the '''9th Battalion, Princess Louise's Regiment (The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)''' but in March 1909 it was renamed to represent the county designation to become the '''9th (The Dumbartonshire) Btn'''.

The second line also had the task of taking over the role of home defence while at the same time providing and training reinforcements for the original units (1st line). The second line battalion later had the role of providing coastal defence.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":14\">Westlake, Men-at-Arms, pp. 17-8.</ref>\n\nOn 21 September 1914 the 2nd line battalion was formed in [[Dumbarton]] (Temporarily re-designated for period from 11 August 1915-11 January 1916 as No.12 Btn, [[62nd Division (United Kingdom)|62nd Division]]).

When the [[Territorial Force]] was disbanded in 1919, [[Dumbartonshire]] was left with no TF affiliation at all due to their battalion (9th) being disbanded during the middle of the last war.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" />\n\nOn 1 January 1920 the new [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) was designated as the successor to the former TF, and most of the units of the later were reformed. Just a year before, the [[War Office]] informed the Dumbartonshire Territorial Force Association that a cadre was to be sponsored in [[Dumbarton]]. When the TA was reformed, the cadre was expanded to form the nucleus of the new '''9th (The Dumbartonshire) Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)''' which was reconstituted on 7 February 1920. When the new battalion was formed, it was not grouped as eight companies, but rather the new 'four company establishment' of which all infantry were now based on. A small name change of the battalion occurred in August 1937 when it became the '''9th (Dumbartonshire) Btn''', dropping 'The' from the sub-title.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" /> By 1938 (just before their change in role) the battalion was organised as;<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" /><ref>[http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_org/div_inf_inf.html Infantry Brigade, Infantry Division] at [http://niehorster.org World War II Armed Forces - Orders of Battle and Organizations].</ref>\n\n* Battalion Headquarters at [[Dumbarton Castle]]\n** Pipes and Drums of the 9th Btn (acting as stretcher bearers)\n* Headquarters Company in [[Dumbarton]]\n* A Company in [[Alexandria, Scotland|Alexandria]] (from old F Co)\n* B Company (same as above) in [[Kirkintilloch]] (from old B Co)\n* C Company (same as above) in [[Helensburgh]] (from old A Co)\n* D Company (same as above) in [[Clydebank]] (from old G Co)\n\n=== 54th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery ===\n{{Main|Munich Crisis}}\nIn 1938, Hitler's [[Third Reich]] was in the process of expanding, first the annex of [[Memel, East Prussia|Memel]], then the annexation and takeover of [[Austria]] during the [[Anschluss]]. The last step of this was the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] which was has a strong German presence through the local Nazi party. On 30 September 1938 the 'four great powers' ([[Kingdom of Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], and [[Third French Republic]]) of Europe signed the '[[Munich Agreement]]' which gave the [[Sudetenland]] (without the consent of the Czechs) to Germany.<ref group=\"Notes\">No ref needed, basic historical knowledge.</ref> Following the [[Munich Crisis]], the anti-aircraft (AA) branch of the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA) was rapidly expanded following a report which presented the need for more modern AA defences.

This meant rejecting the earlier doctrine of a 'balanced' allocation of resources between the three Services<sup>6</sup> and allowing a clear priority to the air arm. The priority was becoming more pronounced as the crisis over Czechoslovakia approached, and at the time of Munich, all obstacles to air defences were swept away and nothing but industrial capacity limited the rate of rearmament in the air.<ref>Postan, p. 14.</ref>\n[[File:Bofors-p004596.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bofors-p004596.jpg|thumb|[[40 mm Bofors|Bofors 40 mm LAA gun]] equipped with 'Stiffkey Stick' sights]]\nDue to this expansion, the battalion was transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]], re-organised into three batteries, and renamed as the '''54th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''', this was started on 28 November 1938. When the battalion was converted, unlike their other AA counterparts, the regiment was assigned directly to 'Home Forces', which meant it could be deployed at short notice, much like the later TAVR I formed in 1967.

In October as the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) began forming, and the regiment prepared to move to [[France]] and join the [[1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade]]. Before moving to [[France]], the regiment controlled 12 [[40 mm Bofors|40mm Bofors]] which was well below their establishment.

Although the regiment was based in [[Arras]], 162 LAA Bty was detached to [[3rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade]] in [[Le Havre]], which was a strategically important supply port for the BEF. To make matters worse, by this time the only AA guns the regiment had were now stuck in [[Le Havre]], while the rest of the regiment only manned 12 machine-guns in each battery.<ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nShortly thereafter, [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] had formed up in [[France]], and the regiment was reassigned to Commander Corps RA, [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]]. After joining IIIrd corps, the regiment was joined by the 162nd LAA bty again which had been detached for a short time. Following the beginning of the [[Battle of Belgium]], the BEF and many allied forces moved into [[Belgium]], to take defensive positions near the [[Scheldt|Scheldt river]] ('Escaut' in French). As part of this new 'Escaut Front', the II and III Corps were assigned to defend the area, and the regiment became III Corps' 'Escaut LAA regiment'.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, p. 70.</ref><ref name=\":2\">Joslen, p. 462.</ref><ref name=\":3\">[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bef/page5.html 3 Corps] at [http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk Royal Artillery 1939-45], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928015820/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bef/page5.html Archived] on 28 September 2008 at the [https://web.archive.org Wayback Machine].</ref>\n\nBy the 25th, the corps was tasked with defending the 'Canal Line' which oversaw the [[Scheldt\u2013Rhine Canal]], which was by this time coming under heavy attack by the Germans. When the Germans made their surprise attack through the [[Ardennes]], the entire BEF along with the [[Belgian Army]] and two French armies were cut off from France, and forced to retreat towards [[Calais]]. This operation had in-fact been planned by the British high command, and was to be a last resort move, this operation was code-named '[[Operation Dynamo]]'. When the operation was announced to commence, the regiment began to turn towards Calais in support of the III Corps which was now tasked to guard the routes for the final withdrawal to [[Dunkirk]].<ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, pp. 139, 168.</ref>\n\nAs the regiment started to move towards [[Dunkirk]] they were forced to leave behind much of their heavy equipment including many AA guns and ammunition stores. As the III Corps retreated, the new commanded [[Major General]] S. R. Watson was appointed as command of III Corps and began making quick arrangements for the British withdrawal in the midst of the German onslaught. Finally, on 28 May 1940 the III corps was ordered to evacuate, and was the first to do so.<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, p. 175.</ref>\n\n=== Home Defence ===\nDuring the retreat from [[Dunkirk]], the regiment was forced to leave behind some of their heavy equipment including trucks, tractors, and some guns. When the rest of the regiment, or at-least what was left of it, returned, the BEF lost or had to leave almost 500 [[Anti-aircraft gun|Anti-aircraft guns]] behind, not to mention a lot of ammunition and supplies.<ref>Collier, p. 127.</ref>\n\nBetween the outbreak of war in September 1939 to late 1942, the [[British Army]] started to create experimental 'armoured formations', which later became known as 'armoured divisions'. One of these new divisions was the [[9th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Division]] which started to form up on 1 December 1940. On 14 April 1940, the HQ Staff of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] published order 20/RAC/44 SD7 which expanded the size and roles of the new armoured divisions. For the [[Royal Artillery]], very little was changed though. On 12 June 1941, the regiment joined the [[9th Support Group (United Kingdom)|9th Support Group]] which, as the name suggests, was the supporting group of the [[9th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Division]]. During this period, the regiment was designated as the 'divisional LAA regiment'.

Until late 1944, the regiment didn't see any front-line combat. In late 1944, the regiment moved to an area around [[Antwerp]], and with four troops (units, not soldiers) with support of an armoured car regiment, and some mortar teams were able to hold off attacks on a six-mile front on the [[Antwerp]]-[[Turnhout]] Canal.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":21\" />\n\n=== Scheldt South 'X' Deployment ===\n\n==== Background ====\nAA Command had plenty of warning that the Germans were developing V-1 flying bombs to use against the UK, and had detailed plans in place ([[Operation Diver]]), these plans also covered the strategically important ports of [[Antwerp]] ([[Netherlands]]) and [[Brussels]] ([[Belgium]]). These cities provided rear lines of communication and maintained the supply dep\u00f4ts for the [[21st Army Group]] which was preparing to cross the [[Rhine]] into the [[Rhineland]] and [[Westphalia]]. As a result of these increasing threats from the [[V1 (missile)|V-1]], [[Operation Diver]] was put into effect. As far as the mainland Europe theatre was concerned, the allies were to try and take over all, or most, of the launch sites or air bases from which they were launched. Once [[21st Army Group]] had captured [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]], these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within [[Germany]], and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established.<ref name=\":23\">[[General]] Sir Frederick A.

There were at that time several territorial artillery units still on operational deployments in various theatres overseas.

The regiment's successors can be traced to the modern [[102 (Clyde) Field Squadron, Royal Engineers]] which is based in [[Clydebank]], [[Scotland]] under the [[71 Engineer Regiment (United Kingdom)|71st Engineer Regiment]].<ref name=\":52\" /><ref>Litchfield, Appendix 5, p. 333.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/520-563-regiments.html|title=British Army units from 1945 on - 520 - 563 Regiments 1947-67|website=british-army-units1945on.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\n'''As a Rifle Corps'''\n\nThe uniforms of the first twelve corps were all slate grey, and shortly after the formation of the battalion they were dressed uniformly in tunics, trousers, and skaos of that colour with scarlet facings and piping, grey-and-scarlet diced band and scarlet ball-tuft on the shakos, and brown waist and pouch belts. This uniform was worn till 1864, when it was replaced by a rifle-green one with scarlet collars and piping, and black braid on the cuffs, green shakos with black ball-tuft and red-and-black diced band, and black belts. Busbies with black and light green plumes replaced the shakos in 1874 (when also a double red piping was added to the cuffs) and were worn till 17 November 1881, when helmets with bronze ornaments took their place. The 9th Corps in [[Luss]] (later M Company) was in 1864 clothed in green doublets and Colquhoun tartan kilts, and continued to wear this uniform till its disbandment in 1882.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />\n\n'''Under the Argylls'''\n\nOn 8 March 1887, sanction was given for the battalion to adopt the scarlet doublet with yellow facings and the glengarry with red-and-white diced border of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], to be worn with [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Sutherland]] trews. The belts were changed to white. Officers and staff-serjeants wore blackcocks' tails in the glengarries in review order, and all ranks white spats in review and black leggings in marching order. Sashes were not worn. On 29 March 1904, a drab service dress with red piping on the trousers was authorised, and this was the sole uniform of the mounted and cyclist companies, which worse brown felt hats with it.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\n'''Under the Royal Artillery'''\n\nUpon conversion to artillery, the regiment retained the right to wear the Argyll's bonnet and cap badge. They also wore the regimental flash like the converted 5th and 6th Btns. This custom was carried on after 1947 in the 554th LAA Rgt.<ref name=\":15\" /><ref>Brayley, p. 21.</ref>\n\nThe regiment along with all other regiments of the [[Royal Artillery]] wore the grenade collar badge and [[Royal Artillery]] cannon cap badge on a dark blue beret.

Gladstone paid little attention to military affairs but he was keen on efficiency. In 1870, he pushed through Parliament major changes in Army organisation. [[Germany|Germany's]] stunning triumph over [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions|France]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] proved that the Prussian system of professional soldiers with up-to-date weapons was far superior to the traditional system of gentlemen-soldiers that Britain used. Under Cardwell's localisation scheme, the country was divided into 66 Brigade Districts (later renamed Regimental Districts), based on county boundaries and population density. But, there were limitations to the extent that localisation could be implemented.\n\nOne of these 'brigade districts' was No.58 which maintained a brigade depot in [[Stirling]] which covered the counties of; [[Kinross-shire]], [[Clackmannanshire]], [[Stirlingshire]], '''[[Dumbartonshire]]''', [[Argyllshire]], [[Buteshire]], and [[Renfrewshire]]. No.58 brigade district was linked with two well known Scottish regiments; [[72nd (Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]] and the [[91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]]. Within this brigade, the militia and volunteers of these counties were grouped as to provide a simple 'organisational system' of control.<ref name=\":62\" /><ref>T.F.

For some time, the new commanding officer of the corps in 1881 ([[Lieutenant Colonel]] Commandant, H. Currier) was not satisfied with the conduct of the 'Luss Volunteers'. When the 1st Dumbartonshire RVC was called upon for the royal review in 1881, the company was not invited and told to 'remain at home' due to their dress because the commandant thought they 'spoilt the corp's reputation and style'. In typical Scottish style, the corps instead embarked for [[Edinburgh]] to arrive and march with another corps right next to the Dumbartonshire RVC in direct defiance of the commandant. This is one of the reasons why this company was later disbanded and reformed in [[Renton, West Dunbartonshire|Renton]] on 12 February 1882.

The battalion (as it was now referred to as) was entitled to wear the uniform and badges of the regiment, although it insisted in retaining the elephant and castle emblem in the Argyll badge. After moving under control of the Argylls, the battalion was in-fact ''not'' re-titled as the 6th (Dumbartonshire) Volunteer Btn, but instead referred to as the ''[6th Volunteer Btn]'' 1st Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps. In 1884, 'L' company based in [[Cumbernauld]] was reduced to a detachment in 'K' Company, and a new 'L' company was raised on 1 April 1884 in [[Yoker]]. In 1900 just before the battalion sent volunteers to [[South Africa]], the battalion formed two specialist companies 'O' (Mounted) in [[Maryhill]] and 'Q' (Cyclists) in [[Dumbarton]]. In 1891, the corps had a small name to change to become the '''1st Dumbartonshire Volunteer Rifle Corps'''. The years 1881-1908 saw a marked improvement in the organisation, training and equipment of the local volunteers as the government attempted to increase the fighting value of these forces.

In his 'Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill', Mr Haldane set up an establishment of fourteen divisions (infantry), fourteen mounted brigades (yeomanry), army troops, and troops for coastal defence. These to be raised and administered locally by a number of Territorial Force Associations. Under these reforms, the structure of infantry units were also altered, with each containing a peace establishment of 1,009 of all ranks in 8 companies 'A' to 'H', all under command of a [[Lieutenant Colonel]].<ref>Westlake, The Territorials, Introduction and p. 2.</ref><ref>Westlake, Men-at-Arms, p. 3.</ref>\n\n=== Prewar ===\n[[File:Argyll_&_Sutherland_Highlanders_recruiting_poster_1914.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Argyll_&_Sutherland_Highlanders_recruiting_poster_1914.jpg|alt=|thumb|A 1914 recruiting poster for the Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders]]\nWhen the [[Territorial Force]] was formed, the corps was transferred and redesignated as the '''9th Battalion, Princess Louise's Regiment (The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)''' but in March 1909 it was renamed to represent the county designation to become the '''9th (The Dumbartonshire) Btn'''.

On 30 September 1938 the 'four great powers' ([[Kingdom of Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], and [[Third French Republic]]) of Europe signed the '[[Munich Agreement]]' which gave the [[Sudetenland]] (without the consent of the Czechs) to Germany.<ref group=\"Notes\">No ref needed, basic historical knowledge.</ref> Following the [[Munich Crisis]], the anti-aircraft (AA) branch of the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA) was rapidly expanded following a report which presented the need for more modern AA defences.

This meant rejecting the earlier doctrine of a 'balanced' allocation of resources between the three Services<sup>6</sup> and allowing a clear priority to the air arm. The priority was becoming more pronounced as the crisis over Czechoslovakia approached, and at the time of Munich, all obstacles to air defences were swept away and nothing but industrial capacity limited the rate of rearmament in the air.<ref>Postan, p. 14.</ref>\n[[File:Bofors-p004596.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bofors-p004596.jpg|thumb|[[40 mm Bofors|Bofors 40 mm LAA gun]] equipped with 'Stiffkey Stick' sights]]\nDue to this expansion, the battalion was transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]], re-organised into three batteries, and re-named as the '''54th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''', this was started on 28 November 1938.

As part of this new 'Escaut Front', the II and III Corps were assigned to defend the area, and the regiment became III Corps' 'Escaut LAA regiment'.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, p. 70.</ref><ref name=\":2\">Joslen, p. 462.</ref><ref name=\":3\">[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bef/page5.html 3 Corps] at [http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk Royal Artillery 1939-45], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928015820/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bef/page5.html Archived] on 28 September 2008 at the [https://web.archive.org Wayback Machine].</ref>\n\nBy the 25th, the corps was tasked with defending the 'Canal Line' which oversaw the [[Scheldt\u2013Rhine Canal]], which was by this time coming under heavy attack by the Germans. When the Germans made their surprise attack through the [[Ardennes]], the entire BEF along with the [[Belgian Army]] and two french armies were cut off from France, and forced to retreat towards [[Calais]]. This operation had in-fact been planned by the British high command, and was to be a last resort move, this operation was code-named '[[Operation Dynamo]]'. When the operation was announced to commence, the regiment began to turn towards Calais in support of the III Corps which was now tasked to guard the routes for the final withdrawal to [[Dunkirk]].<ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, pp. 139, 168.</ref>\n\nAs the regiment started to move towards [[Dunkirk]] they were forced to leave behind much of their heavy equipment including many AA guns and ammunition stores. As the III Corps retreated, the new commanded [[Major General]] S. R. Watson was appointed as command of III Corps and began making quick arrangements for the British withdrawal in the midst of the German onslaught. Finally, on 28 May 1940 the III corps was ordered to evacuate, and was the first to do so.<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, p. 175.</ref>\n\n=== Home Defence ===\nDuring the retreat from [[Dunkirk]], the regiment was forced to leave behind some of their heavy equipment including trucks, tractors, and some guns. When the rest of the regiment, or at-least what was left of it, returned, the BEF lost or had to leave almost 500 [[Anti-aircraft gun|Anti-aircraft guns]] behind, not to mention a lot of ammunition and supplies.<ref>Collier, p. 127.</ref>\n\nBetween the outbreak of war in September 1939 to late 1942, the [[British Army]] started to create experimental 'armoured formations', which later became known as 'armoured divisions'. One of these new divisions was the [[9th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Division]] which started to form up on 1 December 1940. On 14 April 1940, the HQ Staff of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] published order 20/RAC/44 SD7 which expanded the size and roles of the new armoured divisions. For the [[Royal Artillery]], very little was changed though. On 12 June 1941, the regiment joined the [[9th Support Group (United Kingdom)|9th Support Group]] which, as the name suggests, was the supporting group of the [[9th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Division]]. During this period, the regiment was designated as the 'divisional LAA regiment'. On 11 June 1942 the support group was disbanded, and the regiment was moved under command of CRA, 9th Armoured Division in the same role.<ref>Joslen, p. 4.</ref><ref>Joslen, p. 220.</ref>\n\n=== Battle of Normandy ===\n[[File:The_British_Army_in_North-west_Europe_1944-45_BU2748.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_British_Army_in_North-west_Europe_1944-45_BU2748.jpg|thumb|Bofors gun of 319 Bty, [[92nd (Loyals) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|92nd (Loyals) LAA Rgt]] in ground support role east of the [[Rhine]], 26 Mar 1945.]]\nBy 3 February 1944, the regiment was moved out of the 9th Armoured Division and un brigaded for a short time before joining the Major General Royal Artillery, [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]]. When [[Operation Overlord]] was launched on 6 June 1944, the regiment was placed under the command of the 106th Air Field Defence Brigade, which was tasked with defending the RAF bases which were to be quickly constructed in [[France]] after the initial invasion.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref>Joslen, p. 23.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/44-06-06_Neptune/Land/_army_02_artillery.htm|title=Major General, Royal Artillery, 2nd British Army, 06.06.44|website=niehorster.org|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">Joslen, p. 463.</ref><ref name=\":21\">Ellis, Battle of Normandy, Location 10198.</ref>\n\nOn D+4, the regiment with the brigade landed in [[France]] to undertake airfield defence tasks in support of the [[2nd Tactical Air Force|(RAF) 2nd Tactical Air Force]]. Until late 1944, the regiment didn't see any front-line combat. In late 1944, the regiment moved to an area around [[Antwerp]], and with four troops (units, not soldiers) with support of an armoured car regiment, and some mortar teams were able to hold off attacks on a six-mile front on the [[Antwerp]]-[[Turnhout]] Canal.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":21\" />\n\n=== Scheldt South 'X' Deployment ===\n\n==== Background ====\nAA Command had plenty of warning that the Germans were developing V-1 flying bombs to use against the UK, and had detailed plans in place ([[Operation Diver]]), these plans also covered the strategically important ports of [[Antwerp]] ([[Netherlands]]) and [[Brussels]] ([[Belgium]]). These cities provided rear lines of communication and maintained the supply dep\u00f4ts for the [[21st Army Group]] which was preparing to cross the [[Rhine]] into the [[Rhineland]] and [[Westphalia]]. As a result of these increasing threats from the [[V1 (missile)|V-1]], [[Operation Diver]] was put into effect. As far as the mainland Europe theatre was concerned, the allies were to try and take over all, or most, of the launch sites or air bases from which they were launched. Once [[21st Army Group]] had captured [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]], these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within [[Germany]], and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established.<ref name=\":23\">[[General]] Sir Frederick A.

On 20 September 1944, the regiment was placed under command of the 74th AA Bde which had been tasked with covering Schledt South along with the 76th AA Bde in the north. On this day, the regiment began to replace the 106th AA Bde. The regiment was then deployed in the area and saw constant action against both the [[Luftwaffe]] and V-1s. By mid-December, the regiment was moved under command of the 105th AA Bde, but remained in their position and role.<ref>Joslen, pp. 334\u20135.</ref><ref>Joslen, Table LVII, p. 366.</ref>\n\nAs the V-1 threat diminished, the regiment moved across the [[Rhine]] and into [[Germany]] where it remained on garrison duty until 4 February 1946 when it began the process of being placed into [[Suspended Animation (military)|suspended animation]] (S/A) in the [[British Army of the Rhine]], on 15 March this process was complete.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":18\" />\n\n== Postwar ==\nFollowing the end of hostilities, by 1946 most territorial artillery regiments had been either disbanded or placed in suspended animation. On 1 January 1947 many of these regiments were reconstituted and many new regiments were formed as part of the reformed and re-organised [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA), with new numbers according to the renumbering plan for the complete re-designation of all [[Royal Artillery]] units, both regular and territorial. There were at that time several territorial artillery units still on operational deployments in various theatres overseas. Following reformation the TA regiments of the [[Royal Artillery]] adopted a 'standard' organisation which consisted of; RHQ, P, Q, and R Batteries all of which were based in [[Dumbarton]].<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":6\">Litchfield, pp. 5-6.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Royal Artillery|Royal Artillery's]] renumbering system, light anti-aircraft regiments were granted numbers between 512 and 558, and granted '''554th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''' as a result. On 1 April 1947, the TA was reformed, and subsequently moved under command of the local [[68th Anti-Aircraft Brigade|68th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (TA)]], headquartered in [[Glasgow]]. Finally on 10 March 1955, [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] was disbanded and the regiment was absorbed into the 402nd (5th/6th Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Regiment, Royal Artillery in [[Greenock]]. The regiment's successors can be traced to the modern [[102 (Clyde) Field Squadron, Royal Engineers]] which is based in [[Clydebank]], [[Scotland]] under the [[71 Engineer Regiment (United Kingdom)|71st Engineer Regiment]].<ref name=\":52\" /><ref>Litchfield, Appendix 5, p. 333.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/520-563-regiments.html|title=British Army units from 1945 on - 520 - 563 Regiments 1947-67|website=british-army-units1945on.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\n'''As a Rifle Corps'''\n\nThe uniforms of the first twelve corps were all slate grey, and shortly after the formation of the battalion they were dressed uniformly in tunics, trousers, and skaos of that colour with scarlet facings and piping, grey-and-scarlet diced band and scarlet ball-tuft on the shakos, and brown waist and pouch belts. This uniform was worn till 1864, when it was replaced by a rifle-green one with scarlet collars and piping, and black braid on the cuffs, green shakos with black ball-tuft and red-and-black diced band, and black belts. Busbies with black and light green plumes replaced the shakos in 1874 (when also a double red piping was added to the cuffs) and were worn till 17 November 1881, when helmets with bronze ornaments took their place. The 9th Corps in [[Luss]] (later M Company) was in 1864 clothed in green doublets and Colquhoun tartan kilts, and continued to wear this uniform till its disbandment in 1882.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />\n\n'''Under the Argylls'''\n\nOn 8 March 1887, sanction was given for the battalion to adopt the scarlet doublet with yellow facings and the glengarry with red-and-white diced border of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], to be worn with [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Sutherland]] trews. The belts were changed to white. Officers and staff-serjeants wore blackcocks' tails in the glengarries in review order, and all ranks white spats in review and black leggings in marching order. Sashes were not worn.
