It is operated and owned by [[Merlin Entertainments]] and includes rides, a themed hotel, live events and [[Stealth (roller coaster)|Stealth]], the UK's fastest rollercoaster.\n\nAfter demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s, the site became a gravel pit. Thorpe Park Resort was built in the 1970s on the gravel pit which was partially flooded, creating a water-based theme for the park. It was officially opened to the public by [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]] in 1979. It has since grown into one of the major theme parks in the UK.\n\nMajor attractions include a large water ride ''[[Tidal Wave (Thorpe Park)|Tidal Wave]]'', a number of rollercoasters including ''[[Colossus (Thorpe Park)|Colossus]], [[Nemesis Inferno]], [[Stealth (roller coaster)|Stealth]], [[Saw \u2013 The Ride]], [[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'', ''[[X (roller coaster)|The Walking Dead: The Ride]]'' and dark ride ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]''. Other smaller attractions include a water area called Amity Beach and an [[Angry Birds]] themed land. It also has on-site accommodation, the Thorpe Shark Hotel.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Thorpe Park Lake in early days - geograph.org.uk - 771796.jpg|thumb|153x153px|Thorpe Park Lake in July 1979, the year the park opened to the public|left]]\n\nThe demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s saw the site transform into a gravel pit, originally owned by [[RMC Group|Ready Mixed Concrete Limited]]. In the 1970s RMC flooded part of the site and created a water leisure and exhibition park, opening in 1979. The first theme park development began a few years later, with new attractions opening throughout the 1980s-90s. The last large attraction opened by the park's original owners was \"X:\\No Way Out\" in 1996. In 1998, [[The Tussauds Group]] bought the park. From the outset the park started opening key attractions such as Tidal Wave in 2000, Colossus in 2002, Nemesis Inferno in 2003 and Stealth in 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn May 2007, [[Blackstone Group]] purchased The Tussauds Group from then-owner [[Dubai International Capital]] for US$1.9 billion; the company was merged by Blackstone into [[Merlin Entertainments]] and Merlin took over operation of Thorpe Park.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2812377/Merlin-conjures-up-leaseback-deal.html|title=Merlin conjures up leaseback deal|date=17 July 2007|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/05/AR2007030501369.html|title=Blackstone Buys Madame Tussauds Chain|first=David|last=Cho|date=6 March 2007|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Dubai International Capital also gained 20% of Merlin Entertainments.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal | date=5 March 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 July 2007, as part of the financing for the Tussauds deal, Merlin sold Thorpe Park, to private investor [[Nick Leslau]] and his investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6902797.stm | work=BBC News | title=Alton Towers sold in \u00a3622m deal | date=17 July 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> Although it is owned by Prestbury, the site is operated by Merlin based on a renewable 35-year lease.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> In 2018, along with other Merlin attractions, Thorpe Park teamed up with [[Coca-Cola]] to offer half price tickets for recycled plastic bottles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/25/uk-theme-parks-to-offer-half-price-entry-in-exchange-for-used-plastic-bottles|title=UK theme parks to offer half-price entry in exchange for used plastic bottles|last=Smithers|first=Rebecca|date=2018-07-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe target audience for the Resort is Teenagers and Young Adults, adding rides such as Saw - The Ride and The Swarm for example.

Attractions in this area include ''Angry Birds 4D'', ''Detonator: Bombs Away'' and ''King Pig's Wild Hog Dodgems''.\n* ''Old Town'' is located towards the back of the park and includes ''[[Saw - The Ride]]'', ''Rocky Express'', ''Timber Tug Boat'' and ''Lumber Jump''. \n* ''Lost City'' contains ''[[Colossus (Thorpe Park)|Colossus]]'', ''Rush'', ''Quantum'', ''Vortex'' and ''Zodiac''.\n* ''Swarm Island'' opened as the plaza for The Swarm.\n* ''The Dock Yard'' (initially named 'The Depot') is the plaza immediately outside ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]'' and includes the nearby ''[[The Walking Dead: The Ride]]'' rollercoaster.\n\n===Port and Basecamp===\nThe 'Basecamp' area contains the turnstiles and bridge where guests enter the park. This leads to the dome, now named 'The Port', which houses Fin's Bar and Grill, an arcade area, food and beverage outletes, toilets, lockers, the Island Gift Shop, guest services, first aid and staff areas.\n\nThe dome was previously known as 'Port Atlantis' with an Atlantis themed interior. Much the scenery and underwater effect went missing since Merlin's acquisition of the park and was removed altogether after the building's change of name.\n\n===Amity===\nAmity is set as a 1950s-era American fishing village hit by a [[Tsunami|tidal wave]] and opened with ''Tidal Wave'' in 2000. It was previously named 'Amity Cove', as still named on themed signage. The area was expanded in 2006 with ''Stealth'', set at 'Amity Speedway' racetrack. It later took on attractions from the former 'Neptune's Beach' family area, ''Depth Charge'', ''Wet Wet Wet'' and ''Amity Beach'' outdoor water park.\n\nIt also includes attractions from the former 'European Park' area, ''[[Flying Fish (roller coaster)|Flying Fish]]'' and ''Storm In A Teacup'. Flying Fish was originally located beside Tidal Wave but moved following construction of Stealth to its present location. In 2011, the raft water ride ''[[Storm Surge (ride)|Storm Surge]]'' was re-located from ''[[Cypress Gardens]]'' in Florida, USA to the former site of the 'Octopus Garden' children's area.\n\n=== The Jungle ===\nThe area's main attractions are ''[[Nemesis Inferno]]'', a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted coaster set in a volcano, and ''[[Rumba Rapids]]''. Previously named 'Calypso Quay', the area includes part of the former 'Ranger County' family area, including ''Mr Monkey's Banana Ride'', as well as shopfronts and restaurants from the former 'European Park' area.\n\nIn 2019, ''Jungle Escape'' opened in the building formerly housing the ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity...]]'' Maze.\n \n==== Angry Birds Land ====\nAngry Birds Land opened in May 2014 and is sponsored by the [[Angry Birds]] video game.  Attractions include ''Angry Birds 4D'', ''King Pig's Wild Hog Dodgems'' and ''[[Detonator: Bombs Away]]''.\n\n=== The Dock Yard ===\nThis area is primarily the plaza for ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]'' and also contains ''[[The Walking Dead: The Ride]]''. The area has no themed features, other than buildings and scenery remaining from 'Octopus's Garden' (a since-closed children's area).\n\n=== Lost City ===\nThe Lost City theme is that of ruins of a recently unearthed Atlantean civilisation with the Colossus roller coaster as the main attraction opening in 2002. The area first opened in 2001 with the ''[[Vortex (Thorpe Park)|Vortex]]'' and ''[[Zodiac (ride)|Zodiac]]'' rides as the only attractions. In 2003 ''Quantum'', a [[magic carpet]] ride opened.  More attractions have since joined the rides line up with ''[[Rush (Thorpe Park)|Rush]]'' an [[S&S Worldwide|S&S]] Screamin' Swing which opened in 2005.\n\n=== Old Town ===\nThe main ride in this area is ''[[Saw - The Ride]]'', a [[Gerstlauer]] [[Euro-Fighter]] with a 100-degree drop. The ride is sponsored by the Saw movie franchise and is set in a derelict warehouse. ''[[Samurai (ride)|Samurai]]'' was relocated from [[Chessington World of Adventures Resort|Chessington World of Adventures]] in 2004.  ''Timber Tug Boat'' and ''Lumber Jump'' were children's attractions relocated from the Weymouth SeaLife Adventure Park and Marine Sanctuary. The area includes a [[Burger King]] and the Wild Wings Noodle Bar.\n\nThe area was previously named 'Canada Creek' and was the plaza for [[Loggers Leap]] log flume, opened in 1989. It had a loose Western theme, although this has mostly been lost through redevelopments. Today the main attractions listed in the area sit outside the plaza. ''Rocky Express'', a small Mack flat ride, is the only attraction remaining from 'Canada Creek'.\n\nLogger's Leap has remained nonoperational since 2015 and its permanent closure was confirmed in 2019.<ref name=\"twitter.com\"/> This area also was home to ''Slammer'' a ''[[S&S Worldwide|S&S]]'' ''[[Sky Swat]]'', which also still stands but was confirmed to be permanently closed.\n\n=== Swarm Island ===\nSwarm Island is the plaza for ''[[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'', a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] wing-rider rollercoaster, opened in 2012. The area was built on land reclaimed from the surrounding lakes. The area is themed as the scene of an apocalyptic disaster with a crashed plane, various damaged emergency vehicles a destroyed church and other destroyed structures.\n\n==Records held by the park==\n\n* ''[[Nemesis Inferno]]'' is the first inverted coaster to feature interlocking corkscrews.\n* ''[[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'' opened as Europe's tallest Wing coaster. \n*[[SAW - The Ride]] has the steepest drop not controlled by brakes and was marketed as the worlds first horror movie themed roller coaster. While the park claimed it had the world's steepest drop on any roller coaster this isn't true as [[Steel Hawg]] at [[Indiana Beach]] had opened the previous year with a 111\u00b0 drop.

[[Ministry of Sound]] club nights in The Dome occur one Saturday night a month from April to September. These club nights feature well known music DJs playing a variety of themed nights. However for 2019 these were replaced with the Club MTV event held around the park during normal hours rather than in The Dome. Summer Nights is when the park reopens after a normal day on Friday and Saturday Nights in July and August from 7pm-10pm for some late-night rides consisting of The Swarm, SAW - The Ride, Stealth, Colossus, Nemesis Inferno, Walking Dead and others.\n\n===Fright Nights===\n\n''Fright Nights'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thorpepark.com/events/fright-nights|title=FRIGHT NIGHTS at THORPE PARK Resort|website=www.thorpepark.com}}</ref> formerly \"Fright Nites\" is Thorpe Park's terrifying annual halloween event and also its largest Halloween event in the UK. It's an event that has been running at Thorpe Park since 2002, celebrating Halloween with the park staying open until late at night, as well as operating a range of temporary halloween attractions. Roaming actors in costume or with make up can also be found around the park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/thorpe-park-fright-nights-an-evilution/ |title=Haunted Attractions UK - Thorpe Park Fright Nights... an EVILution! |accessdate=30 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226195505/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/thorpe-park-fright-nights-an-evilution/ |archivedate=26 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During Fright Nights, the park stays open until 10pm, with a range of scare mazes available for guests, who normally enter in groups of 8-10. \"Face it Alone\" has sometimes been available as an upcharge, where a guest enters unaccompanied and must sign a disclaimer before entering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forum.maniahub.com/topic/11360-what-to-expect-from-face-it-alone-2016-my-first-ever/|title=What to expect from Face it Alone 2016 (my first ever.)|website=Thorpe Park Mania Forums}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Fright Nights was relaunched with a horror movie theme, courtesy of a three-year contract with [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. All of the pre-existing Fright Nights attractions were removed with the exception of The Asylum to make way for new horror-film themed attractions.\n\nIn 2014, when the [[Thorpe Shark Hotel]] opened, Thorpe Park decided to do an overnight scare attraction that involved live actors terrorising you while you are in your bed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Before the experience began you were led to the back of the hotel where an actor would read you some scary stories.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2017 Fright Nights was reinvented with a Walking Dead theme. The addition of two Walking Dead attractions coincided with the season 8 premier of the show. SAW Alive, The Big Top and Platform 15 remained in operation from previous years, with Containment returning as an upcharge attraction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

The accommodation takes its name from its shark head entrance feature built from scrapped park signage.\n\nThe hotel initially opened in 2013 as 'The Crash Pad', run by external company [[Snoozebox]]. The temporary development was purchased by the park the following year and rebranded as the Thorpe Shark Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sim|first1=Nick|title=Thorpe Park names new hotel for 2014 as Thorpe Shark Hotel|url=http://www.themeparktourist.com/news/20140313/16793/thorpe-park-names-new-hotel-2014-thorpe-shark-hotel|website=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThorpe Park had originally been planning to build a permanent 250-bed hotel as far back as 2006. This would have been located on the opposite side of the lake, on the site of former excavation works, featuring a lakeside bar, health club and restaurant.\n\nThe development was pitched again following the installation of 'The Crash Pad' to \"test market conditions\". The park received planning permission to construct the permanent hotel in 2014, with construction planned to begin in 2016 and an opening in 2018. However, the hotel was never constructed and the Shark Hotel's planning permission was extended by 10 years instead.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Total Thorpe Park|first1=|title=Thorpe Park Hotel planning|url=http://www.totalthorpepark.co.uk/features/futurehotel.shtml|website=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Developments ==\n\nIn 2010, the park outlined a 5-year development plan that outlined new coasters for 2012 (The Swarm) and 2015, as well as a permanent lakeside hotel.

It is operated and owned by [[Merlin Entertainments]] and includes rides, a themed hotel, live events and [[Stealth (roller coaster)|Stealth]], the UK's fastest rollercoaster.\n\nAfter demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s, the site became a gravel pit. Thorpe Park Resort was built in the 1970s on the gravel pit which was partially flooded, creating a water-based theme for the park. It was officially opened to the public by [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]] in 1979. It has since grown into one of the major theme parks in the UK.\n\nMajor attractions include a large water ride ''[[Tidal Wave (Thorpe Park)|Tidal Wave]]'', a number of rollercoasters including ''[[Colossus (Thorpe Park)|Colossus]], [[Nemesis Inferno]], [[Stealth (roller coaster)|Stealth]], [[Saw \u2013 The Ride]], [[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'', ''[[X (roller coaster)|The Walking Dead: The Ride]]'' and dark ride ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]''. Other smaller attractions include a water area called Amity Beach and an [[Angry Birds]] themed land. It also has on-site accommodation, the Thorpe Shark Hotel.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Thorpe Park Lake in early days - geograph.org.uk - 771796.jpg|thumb|153x153px|Thorpe Park Lake in July 1979, the year the park opened to the public|left]]\n\nThe demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s saw the site transform into a gravel pit, originally owned by [[RMC Group|Ready Mixed Concrete Limited]]. In the 1970s RMC flooded part of the site and created a water leisure and exhibition park, opening in 1979. The first theme park development began a few years later, with new attractions opening throughout the 1980s-90s. The last large attraction opened by the park's original owners was \"X:\\No Way Out\" in 1996. In 1998, [[The Tussauds Group]] bought the park. From the outset the park started opening key attractions such as Tidal Wave in 2000, Colossus in 2002, Nemesis Inferno in 2003 and Stealth in 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn May 2007, [[Blackstone Group]] purchased The Tussauds Group from then-owner [[Dubai International Capital]] for US$1.9 billion; the company was merged by Blackstone into [[Merlin Entertainments]] and Merlin took over operation of Thorpe Park.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2812377/Merlin-conjures-up-leaseback-deal.html|title=Merlin conjures up leaseback deal|date=17 July 2007|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/05/AR2007030501369.html|title=Blackstone Buys Madame Tussauds Chain|first=David|last=Cho|date=6 March 2007|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Dubai International Capital also gained 20% of Merlin Entertainments.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal | date=5 March 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 July 2007, as part of the financing for the Tussauds deal, Merlin sold Thorpe Park, to private investor [[Nick Leslau]] and his investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6902797.stm | work=BBC News | title=Alton Towers sold in \u00a3622m deal | date=17 July 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> Although it is owned by Prestbury, the site is operated by Merlin based on a renewable 35-year lease.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> In 2018, along with other Merlin attractions, Thorpe Park teamed up with [[Coca-Cola]] to offer half price tickets for recycled plastic bottles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/25/uk-theme-parks-to-offer-half-price-entry-in-exchange-for-used-plastic-bottles|title=UK theme parks to offer half-price entry in exchange for used plastic bottles|last=Smithers|first=Rebecca|date=2018-07-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe target audience for the Resort is Teenagers and Young Adults, adding rides such as Saw - The Ride and The Swarm for example.

Attractions in this area include ''Angry Birds 4D'', ''Detonator: Bombs Away'' and ''King Pig's Wild Hog Dodgems''.\n* ''Old Town'' is located towards the back of the park and includes ''[[Saw - The Ride]]'', ''Rocky Express'', ''Timber Tug Boat'' and ''Lumber Jump''. \n* ''Lost City'' contains ''[[Colossus (Thorpe Park)|Colossus]]'', ''Rush'', ''Quantum'', ''Vortex'' and ''Zodiac''.\n* ''Swarm Island'' opened as the plaza for The Swarm.\n* ''The Dock Yard'' (initially named 'The Depot') is the plaza immediately outside ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]'' and includes the nearby ''[[The Walking Dead: The Ride]]'' rollercoaster.\n\n===Port and Basecamp===\nThe 'Basecamp' area contains the turnstiles and bridge where guests enter the park. This leads to the dome, now named 'The Port', which houses Fin's Bar and Grill, an arcade area, food and beverage outletes, toilets, lockers, the Island Gift Shop, guest services, first aid and staff areas.\n\nThe dome was previously known as 'Port Atlantis' with an Atlantis themed interior. Much the scenery and underwater effect went missing since Merlin's acquisition of the park and was removed altogether after the building's change of name.\n\n===Amity===\nAmity is set as a 1950s-era American fishing village hit by a [[Tsunami|tidal wave]] and opened with ''Tidal Wave'' in 2000. It was previously named 'Amity Cove', as still named on themed signage. The area was expanded in 2006 with ''Stealth'', set at 'Amity Speedway' racetrack. It later took on attractions from the former 'Neptune's Beach' family area, ''Depth Charge'', ''Wet Wet Wet'' and ''Amity Beach'' outdoor water park.\n\nIt also includes attractions from the former 'European Park' area, ''[[Flying Fish (roller coaster)|Flying Fish]]'' and ''Storm In A Teacup'. Flying Fish was originally located beside Tidal Wave but moved following construction of Stealth to its present location. In 2011, the raft water ride ''[[Storm Surge (ride)|Storm Surge]]'' was re-located from ''[[Cypress Gardens]]'' in Florida, USA to the former site of the 'Octopus Garden' children's area.\n\n=== The Jungle ===\nThe area's main attractions are ''[[Nemesis Inferno]]'', a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted coaster set in a volcano, and ''[[Rumba Rapids]]''. Previously named 'Calypso Quay', the area includes part of the former 'Ranger County' family area, including ''Mr Monkey's Banana Ride'', as well as shopfronts and restaurants from the former 'European Park' area.\n\nIn 2019, ''Jungle Escape'' opened in the building formerly housing the ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity...]]'' Maze.\n \n==== Angry Birds Land ====\nAngry Birds Land opened in May 2014 and is sponsored by the [[Angry Birds]] video game.  Attractions include ''Angry Birds 4D'', ''King Pig's Wild Hog Dodgems'' and ''[[Detonator: Bombs Away]]''.\n\n=== The Dock Yard ===\nThis area is primarily the plaza for ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]'' and also contains ''[[The Walking Dead: The Ride]]''. The area has no themed features, other than buildings and scenery remaining from 'Octopus's Garden' (a since-closed children's area).\n\n=== Lost City ===\nThe Lost City theme is that of ruins of a recently unearthed Atlantean civilisation with the Colossus roller coaster as the main attraction opening in 2002. The area first opened in 2001 with the ''[[Vortex (Thorpe Park)|Vortex]]'' and ''[[Zodiac (ride)|Zodiac]]'' rides as the only attractions. In 2003 ''Quantum'', a [[magic carpet]] ride opened.  More attractions have since joined the rides line up with ''[[Rush (Thorpe Park)|Rush]]'' an [[S&S Worldwide|S&S]] Screamin' Swing which opened in 2005.\n\n=== Old Town ===\nThe main ride in this area is ''[[Saw - The Ride]]'', a [[Gerstlauer]] [[Euro-Fighter]] with a 100-degree drop. The ride is sponsored by the Saw movie franchise and is set in a derelict warehouse. ''[[Samurai (ride)|Samurai]]'' was relocated from [[Chessington World of Adventures Resort|Chessington World of Adventures]] in 2004.  ''Timber Tug Boat'' and ''Lumber Jump'' were children's attractions relocated from the Weymouth SeaLife Adventure Park and Marine Sanctuary. The area includes a [[Burger King]] and the Wild Wings Noodle Bar.\n\nThe area was previously named 'Canada Creek' and was the plaza for [[Loggers Leap]] log flume, opened in 1989. It had a loose Western theme, although this has mostly been lost through redevelopments. Today the main attractions listed in the area sit outside the plaza. ''Rocky Express'', a small Mack flat ride, is the only attraction remaining from 'Canada Creek'.\n\nLogger's Leap has remained nonoperational since 2015 and its permanent closure was confirmed in 2019.<ref name=\"twitter.com\"/> This area also was home to ''Slammer'' a ''[[S&S Worldwide|S&S]]'' ''[[Sky Swat]]'', which also still stands but was confirmed to be permanently closed.\n\n=== Swarm Island ===\nSwarm Island is the plaza for ''[[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'', a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] wing-rider rollercoaster, opened in 2012. The area was built on land reclaimed from the surrounding lakes. The area is themed as the scene of an apocalyptic disaster with a crashed plane, various damaged emergency vehicles a destroyed church and other destroyed structures.\n\n==Records held by the park==\n\n* ''[[Nemesis Inferno]]'' is the first inverted coaster to feature interlocking corkscrews.\n* ''[[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'' opened as Europe's tallest Wing coaster. \n*[[SAW - The Ride]] has the steepest drop not controlled by brakes and was marketed as the worlds first horror movie themed roller coaster. While the park claimed it had the world's steepest drop on any roller coaster this isn't true as [[Steel Hawg]] at [[Indiana Beach]] had opened the previous year with a 111\u00b0 drop. It now features the ninth steepest drop behind [[The Monster (Adventureland)|The Monster]] at [[Adventureland (Iowa)|Adventureland]], [[Mumbo Jumbo (roller coaster)|Mumbo Jumbo]] at [[Flamingo Land]], [[Timber Drop]] at [[Fraispertuis City]], [[Cannibal (roller coaster)|Cannibal]] at [[Lagoon (amusement park)|Lagoon]], [[Crazy bird (roller coaster)|Crazy bird]] at [[Happy Valley (dongli)]], [[Green Lantern Coaster]] at [[Warner Bros.

[[Ministry of Sound]] club nights in The Dome occur one Saturday night a month from April to September. These club nights feature well known music DJs playing a variety of themed nights. However for 2019 these were replaced with the Club MTV event held around the park during normal hours rather than in The Dome. Summer Nights is when the park reopens after a normal day on Friday and Saturday Nights in July and August from 7pm-10pm for some late-night rides consisting of The Swarm, SAW - The Ride, Stealth, Colossus, Nemesis Inferno, Walking Dead and others.\n\n===Fright Nights===\n\n''Fright Nights'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thorpepark.com/events/fright-nights|title=FRIGHT NIGHTS at THORPE PARK Resort|website=www.thorpepark.com}}</ref> formerly \"Fright Nites\" is Thorpe Park's terrifying annual halloween event and also its largest Halloween event in the UK. It's an event that has been running at Thorpe Park since 2002, celebrating Halloween with the park staying open until late at night, as well as operating a range of temporary halloween attractions. Roaming actors in costume or with make up can also be found around the park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/thorpe-park-fright-nights-an-evilution/ |title=Haunted Attractions UK - Thorpe Park Fright Nights... an EVILution! |accessdate=30 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226195505/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/thorpe-park-fright-nights-an-evilution/ |archivedate=26 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During Fright Nights, the park stays open until 10pm, with a range of scare mazes available for guests, who normally enter in groups of 8-10. \"Face it Alone\" has sometimes been available as an upcharge, where a guest enters unaccompanied and must sign a disclaimer before entering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forum.maniahub.com/topic/11360-what-to-expect-from-face-it-alone-2016-my-first-ever/|title=What to expect from Face it Alone 2016 (my first ever.)|website=Thorpe Park Mania Forums}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Fright Nights was relaunched with a horror movie theme, courtesy of a three-year contract with [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. All of the pre-existing Fright Nights attractions were removed with the exception of The Asylum to make way for new horror-film themed attractions.\n\nIn 2014, when the [[Thorpe Shark Hotel]] opened, Thorpe Park decided to do an overnight scare attraction that involved live actors terrorising you while you are in your bed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Before the experience began you were led to the back of the hotel where an actor would read you some scary stories.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2017 Fright Nights was reinvented with a Walking Dead theme. The addition of two Walking Dead attractions coincided with the season 8 premier of the show. SAW Alive, The Big Top and Platform 15 remained in operation from previous years, with Containment returning as an upcharge attraction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

attraction.\n\n==Hotel==\n\nGuests can stay over on-park at the 'Thorpe Shark Hotel', comprising 90-rooms converted from [[shipping container]]s with a link to facilities in the adjacent Dome. The accommodation takes its name from its shark head entrance feature built from scrapped park signage.\n\nThe hotel initially opened in 2013 as 'The Crash Pad', run by external company [[Snoozebox]]. The temporary development was purchased by the park the following year and rebranded as the Thorpe Shark Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sim|first1=Nick|title=Thorpe Park names new hotel for 2014 as Thorpe Shark Hotel|url=http://www.themeparktourist.com/news/20140313/16793/thorpe-park-names-new-hotel-2014-thorpe-shark-hotel|website=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThorpe Park had originally been planning to build a permanent 250-bed hotel as far back as 2006. This would have been located on the opposite side of the lake, on the site of former excavation works, featuring a lakeside bar, health club and restaurant.\n\nThe development was pitched again following the installation of 'The Crash Pad' to \"test market conditions\". The park received planning permission to construct the permanent hotel in 2014, with construction planned to begin in 2016 and an opening in 2018. However, the hotel was never constructed and the Shark Hotel's planning permission was extended by 10 years instead.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Total Thorpe Park|first1=|title=Thorpe Park Hotel planning|url=http://www.totalthorpepark.co.uk/features/futurehotel.shtml|website=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Developments ==\n\nIn 2010, the park outlined a 5-year development plan that outlined new coasters for 2012 (The Swarm) and 2015, as well as a permanent lakeside hotel. No application was ever submitted for the 2015 development and the intended site of coaster behind The Swarm remains vacant.\n\n==Incidents==\n{{Main|Incidents at European amusement parks#Thorpe Park|l1=Incidents at European amusement parks: Thorpe Park}}\n\n==Gallery==\n\n:''Main gallery: [[commons:Thorpe Park Resort|Thorpe Park Resort at WikiCommons]]''\n<!-- If possible, use only pictures unique to this park.
