[[bacteria]] and [[archea]] make [[Vitamin B12|cobalamin]], vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Many steps are involved in converting [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[uroporphyrinogen III]] and adenosylcobyric acid to the final forms in which it is used by [[enzymes]] in both the producing organisms and other species, including humans who acquire it through their diet.\n==Cobalamin==\n{{Main|Vitamin B12|l1=Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>}}\nCobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) is the largest and most structurally complex [[vitamin]]. It consists of a modified [[tetrapyrrole]], a [[corrin]], with a centrally [[chelated]] [[cobalt]] and is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: [[methylcobalamin]] and [[adenosylcobalamin]]. Most [[prokaryotes]], as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes that use it as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], whereas [[plants]] and [[fungus|fungi]] do not use it. In [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], these enzymes include [[methionine synthase]], [[ribonucleotide reductase]], glutamate and [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]]s, [[ethanolamine ammonia-lyase]], and [[diol]] [[dehydratase]].<ref name=\"pmid12869542\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M305837200 |doi-access = free |title=Comparative Genomics of the Vitamin B12 Metabolism and Regulation in Prokaryotes |year=2003 |last1=Rodionov |first1=Dmitry A. |last2=Vitreschak |first2=Alexey G. |last3=Mironov |first3=Andrey A. |last4=Gelfand |first4=Mikhail S. |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=278 |issue=42 |pages=41148\u201341159 |pmid=12869542 }}</ref> In certain mammals, cobalamin is obtained through the diet, and is required for methionine synthase and [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]].<ref name=\"pmid17163662\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cb6001174   |title=B12 Trafficking in Mammals: A Case for Coenzyme Escort Service |year=2006 |last1=Banerjee |first1=Ruma |journal=ACS Chemical Biology |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=149\u2013159 |pmid=17163662 }}</ref> In humans, it plays essential roles in [[folate]] metabolism and in the synthesis of the [[citric acid cycle]] intermediate, [[succinyl-CoA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-B12|title=Vitamin B12 |publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Overview of cobalamin biosynthesis==\nThere are at least two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in [[bacterium|bacteria]]:<ref name=\"pmid11153269\">{{cite book |doi=10.1016/s0083-6729(01)61009-4 |chapter=Multiple biosynthetic pathways for vitamin B12: Variations on a central theme |title=Cofactor Biosynthesis |series=Vitamins & Hormones |year=2001 |last1=Roessner |first1=Charles A. |last2=Santander |first2=Patricio J. |last3=Scott |first3=A.Ian |volume=61 |pages=267\u2013297 |pmid=11153269 |isbn=9780127098616 }}</ref>\n{|\n|[[File:Biosynthetic pathways to Vitamin B12.jpg|thumb |left|Biosynthetic pathways to Vitamin B12 from aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in bacteria and archaea]]\n|[[File:Vitamin B12.svg|thumb|upright=2|Vitamin B12 (as cyano cobalamin) and its parent cobyric acid]]\n|}\n*[[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] pathway that requires [[oxygen]] and in which cobalt is inserted late in the pathway;<ref name=\"pmid16042605\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/BST0330815  |title=Aerobic synthesis of vitamin B12: Ring contraction and cobalt chelation |year=2005 |last1=Heldt |first1=D. |last2=Lawrence |first2=A.D. |last3=Lindenmeyer |first3=M. |last4=Deery |first4=E. |last5=Heathcote |first5=P. |last6=Rigby |first6=S.E. |last7=Warren |first7=M.J. |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=815\u2013819 |pmid=16042605 |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/068c6dc246314fffbb8137925911c32230d7b9c0 }}</ref><ref name=\"aerobic pathway\" >{{cite web |url=https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=P381-PWY |title=Pathway: adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis II (aerobic) |author=R.

[[bacteria]] and [[archea]] make [[Vitamin B12|cobalamin]], vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Many steps are involved in converting [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[uroporphyrinogen III]] and adenosylcobyric acid to the final forms in which it is used by [[enzymes]] in both the producing organisms and other species, including humans who acquire it through their diet.\n==Cobalamin==\n{{Main|Vitamin B12|l1=Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>}}\nCobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) is the largest and most structurally complex [[vitamin]]. It consists of a modified [[tetrapyrrole]], a [[corrin]], with a centrally [[chelated]] [[cobalt]] and is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: [[methylcobalamin]] and [[adenosylcobalamin]]. Most [[prokaryotes]], as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes that use it as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], whereas [[plants]] and [[fungus|fungi]] do not use it.
