His album ''Ryo Kawasaki and the Golden Dragon Live'' was one of the first all-digital recordings and he created the [[Kawasaki Synthesizer]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. During the 1960s, he played with various Japanese jazz groups and also formed his own bands. In the early 1970s, he moved to New York City, where he settled and worked with [[Gil Evans]], [[Elvin Jones]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[Ted Curson]], [[Joanne Brackeen]] amongst others. In the mid-1980s, Kawasaki drifted out of performing music in favour of writing music software for computers. He also produced several techno dance singles, formed his own record company called Satellites Records, and later returned to jazz-fusion in 1991.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life (1947\u20131968)===\nRyo Kawasaki was born on February 25, 1947, in [[K\u014denji]], Tokyo, while Japan was still struggling and recovering from the early post World War II period. His father, Torao Kawasaki, was a Japanese [[diplomat]] who had worked for The [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] since 1919. Torao worked at several Japanese consulates and embassies, including San Francisco, [[Honolulu]], Fengtian (then capital of [[Manchuria]], now [[Shenyang]] in China), [[Shanghai]], and [[Beijing]] while active as an English teacher and translator for official diplomatic conferences. Ryo's mother, Hiroko, was also multilingual, and spoke German, Russian, English, and Chinese aside from her native tongue Japanese. Hiroko grew up in [[Manchuria]] and then met Torao in [[Shanghai]]. Torao was already 58 years old when Ryo was born as an only child.\n\nKawasaki's mother encouraged him to take piano and ballet lessons, and he took voice lessons and [[solfege]] at age four and violin lessons at five, and was reading music before elementary school. As a grade scholar, he began a lifelong fascination with [[astronomy]] and electronics (he built his own radios, TVs and audio systems including amplifiers and speakers as well as telescopes). When Ryo was 10, he bought a [[ukulele]] and, at 14, he got his first [[acoustic guitar]]. The album ''Midnight Blue'' by [[Kenny Burrell]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]] inspired Ryo to study jazz.\n\nIn high school, he began hanging out at coffee-houses that featured live music, formed a jazz ensemble and built an [[electronic organ]] that served as a primitive [[synthesizer]]. By the time he was 16, his band was playing professionally in cabarets and strip joints. Although he continued to play music regularly, he attended Nippon University, majored in [[quantum physics]] and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] Degree. Although he has failed to prove his main interest and intuitive belief at that time, which is to prove that speed (acceleration) of gravity must be much greater than speed of light. He also did some teaching and contest judging at the [[Yamaha]] musical instrument manufacturer's jazz school. Additionally he worked as a [[sound engineer]] for Japanese [[Victor Records]] and [[Gazell|BGM]]/[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] Music where he learned [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and editing.\n\n===Early career in Japan (1969\u20131973)===\nHe recorded his first solo album for [[Polydor Records]] when he was 22. Although he continued to perform with his jazz group, and at a young age was voted the No.&nbsp;3 [[jazz guitarist]] in a Japanese jazz poll, Kawasaki spent most of the next three years working as [[studio musician]] on everything from advertising jingles to pop songs including countless radio and TV appearances. He recorded his second album for [[Toshiba]] when he was 24. He played with [[B.B. King]] at a blues festival and also met [[George Benson]] (they jammed for five hours at Kawasaki's house).\n\nHe also has recorded and worked with notable Japanese jazz musicians such as drummer Takeshi Inomata and Sound limits, saxophonist Jiro Inagaki and Soul Mates, saxophonist Keiichiro Ebisawa, saxophonist Seiichi Nakamura, pianist Masahiko Sato ([[:ja:\u4f50\u85e4\u5141\u5f66|\u4f50\u85e4\u5141\u5f66]]), saxophonist Hidehiko Matsumoto ([[:ja:\u677e\u672c\u82f1\u5f66|\u677e\u672c\u82f1\u5f66]]) and many others.\n\n===Developments in New York City (1973\u20132002)===\n\n====1973\u20131979 (as guitarist)====\n[[File:Ryo-gil.jpg|thumb|Ryo Kawasaki with [[Gil Evans]] at Sweet Basil in New York City, 1982]]\n[[File:David Williams, Elvin Jones and Ryo Kawasaki.jpg|right|thumb|David Williams, [[Elvin Jones]] and Kawasaki in Rochester, N.Y. 1976]]\nIn 1973, Kawasaki arrived in New York. A friend picked him up at the airport and offered him an immediate gig with [[Joe Lee Wilson]] playing at the [[Lincoln Center]] as part of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. Soon Kawasaki was jamming regularly as part of the jazz community's \"loft scene\", and was invited to play with [[Bobbi Humphrey]]. A few months later, Kawasaki walked up to his apartment and found a stranger waiting for him at his front door. It was [[Gil Evans]] and he invited Kawasaki to join The Gil Evans Orchestra ([[David Sanborn]], [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], [[Lew Soloff]]) which was then working on a jazz recording of [[Jimi Hendrix]] compositions, ''[[The Gil Evans Orchestra Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix]]''. Hendrix had dreamed up the concept with Evans, but Jimi died a week before the project started in 1970. Kawasaki also played on another Gil Evans album on [[RCA Records|RCA]], ''[[There Comes a Time (album)|There Comes a Time]]'', with [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] on drums. Kawasaki rehearsed for a month with the third edition of Tony Williams' Lifetime with trio format with bassist [[Doug Rauch]] working with [[Carlos Santana]] at that time, but Tony left to spend a year in Europe before the band got the chance to perform in public.\n\nKawasaki followed in the footsteps of [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]] and [[Larry Coryell]] by becoming the [[guitarist]] in the [[Chico Hamilton]] Band, playing on a U.S. tour and working on various film scores that Chico recorded in [[Hollywood]]. Kawasaki made his debut U.S. album, ''Juice'', in 1976 for RCA and was one of the first Japanese jazz artists to sign with a major label in the States. Sidemen on the project included [[Tom Coster]] ([[Carlos Santana]]) and [[Sam Morrison]] ([[Miles Davis]]). Kawasaki followed that recording with two more albums, ''Prism'' and ''Eight Mile Road'', for the Japanese [[record label|label]] East Wind. He also joined the [[Elvin Jones]] Band for a year-long tour of North and South America and Europe. By 1978, Kawasaki was tired of touring with other bands and returned to his own projects.\n\nHe explored [[Music of India]], learned [[ragas]] and recorded an Audio Fidelity album, Ring Toss, that combined eastern and western music. With [[Dave Liebman]] he recorded Nature's Revenge for the German [[MPS Records|MPS]] [[label]] and they toured Europe. Ryo also toured European jazz festivals with [[Joanne Brackeen]] as piano \u2013 guitar duo, and they recorded a pair of albums\u2014AFT and Trinkets and Things\u2014for Timeless Records in the Netherlands. In Japan, [[Sony]]'s Open Sky label signed Ryo for three albums\u2014Mirror of my Mind, Little Tree and Live\u2014the latter, recorded in a Tokyo club, was one of the first all-digital recordings. Notable musicians participated on those recordings include [[Michael Brecker]], [[Harvey Mason]], [[Leon Pendarvis]], [[Azar Lawrence]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], [[Lincoln Goines]], [[Badal Roy]], [[Nana Vasconcelos]], [[Buddy Williams (jazz drummer)|Buddy Williams]], [[Larry Willis]], and [[Alex Blake]]. He also recorded an album called ''Sapporo'' for Swiss label America Sound in 1980 while touring Switzerland and Germany.\n\n====1979\u20131990 (as inventor and programmer)====\nKawasaki invented his own [[guitar synthesizer]] in 1979, and used it to perform numerous solo shows at [[planetarium]]s from 1980 to 1983. He also formed the jazz-rock group The Golden Dragon and performed concerts regularly in early 1980s. [[Fostex]] developed the first quarter- inch-tape, eight-track recorder called A8 along with 2 track mastering machine A2 and asked Kawasaki to be the first artist to use it. He recorded the album Ryo in 1981 for [[Philips Records]] and gained notoriety for creating all the music himself. He played only a nylon-string acoustic guitar with all his backing tracks created on his guitar synthesizer including the entire original [[orchestration]] of [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s well known [[Concierto de Aranjuez]] \u2013 [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] movement. He did another similar recording, Lucky Lady, the next year.\n\nWhen the [[Commodore 64]] computer came out with a sound-chip in it, Kawasaki became fascinated by the possibilities. He learned to write [[computer programs]] and devoted 16 hours a day for two years creating four [[Music video game#Free form music games|music software programs]]\u2014''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker|Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Magical Musiquill|Kawasaki Magical Musicquill]]'', and ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki MIDI Workstation|Kawasaki MIDI Workstation]]''\u2014distributed by Sight and Sound Music. The first three programs were for school and home use, and the last one was for professional studios. He created an all-synthesized album, ''Images'', in 1987; and the soundtrack, Pleasure Garden, in 1990, for an [[IMAX]] film about the preservation of the Earth's endangered tropical rain forests.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1990, Kawasaki produced a series of high-charting [[12 inch single|12 inch]] dance  singles\u2014\"Electric World\", \"One Kiss\", \"No Expectations\", \"Say Baby I Love You\", \"Don't Tell Me\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Life is The Rhythm\", \"Pleasure Garden\", and \"Acid Heat\"\u2014that mixed free-style, house, acid house and ambient sounds. All of the production was done at his home studio, The Satellite Station, and the records were released on his own label, Satellites Records. His band and a dance troupe also performed extensively in New York dance clubs. In addition, for five years (1988 to 1993), Kawasaki was the New York producer and director of two Japanese national weekly music radio programs, ''The Music Now'' and ''Idex Music Jam''. In 1991. He also collaborated with Japanese [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] master Kicho Takano and produced \"Crystallization\" in 1986.\n\n====1991\u20132000 (return to jazz guitarist)====\nKawasaki's musical direction took another dramatic turn when he was signed by the new jazz and adult contemporary Japanese label One Voice as an artist and record producer. Kawasaki's return to jazz, and his first album for the label, was the 1992 acoustic solo guitar album ''[[Here, There and Everywhere]]'' (released on One Voice in Japan and on Satellites Records in the U.S.). Kawasaki has produced and performed on three albums by Brazilian singer and guitarist [[Camila Benson]] for this label. Ryo has continued to release a steady string of albums\u2014the acoustic ''My Reverie'' (music from [[Bill Evans]], [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]] and [[Gershwin]]), the electric jazz guitar-oriented ''Love Within The Universe'' (which received considerable airplay across the country), \"Remixes Remixes Vol. 1\" (also featuring Benson), \"Sweet Life\" and CD releases of \"Mirror of my Mind\" (a jazz ensemble recording with [[Harvey Mason]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], Leon Pendarvis and vocalist Radha Shottam).\n\nHis 1999 release ''Cosmic Rhythm'' features British singer lyricist [[Clare Foster]] along with Kawasaki's rhythm section Victor Jones on drums, [[Lincoln Goines]] on bass. The album also features [[David Kikoski]] on piano and [[Shunzo Ohno]] on flugelhorn. All the songs were arranged and recorded by Kawasaki including original ten songs by Ro himself.\n\nDuring 1995\u20131999, three [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists, [[Puff Daddy]], [[Kool G Rap]], and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], recorded Kawasaki's original composition \"[[Bamboo Child]]\" on their latest albums more than twenty years after its original recording.\n\n===Developments in Estonia and beyond (2000\u20132020)===\nIn 2001, Kawasaki released live a studio trio album \"Reval\", recorded in [[Tallinn]], Estonia with Estonian musicians [[Toivo Unt]] on bass, [[Aivar Vassiljev]] on drums, and Kristi Keel on [[English horn]].\n\nHis other projects include being a composer, music director as well as a guitarist for the jazz ballet \"Still Point\" for the Estonian National Opera House during 2000-2002. This ballet is choreographed by [[Russell Adamson]], a native Jamaican who resides in [[Helsinki]].\n\nKawasaki released his third [[acoustic guitar]] solo album 'E' in 2002.\n\nFrom the year 2000 on, Kawasaki further expanded his live appearances into Russia and [[Baltic region]] Jazz Festivals. His quartet has appeared at Rigas Ritmi Jazz Festival in [[Riga]]/[[Latvia]], [[Pori Jazz|Pori]] and other jazz festivals in Finland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and [[Saransk]] Jazz Ark Festival. He also appeared numerous times at [[N\u00f5mme]] Jazz Festival in Estonia while assisting the production of this jazz festival.\n\nKawasaki's projects during 2005\u20132008 included guitar trio project with American drummer [[Brian Melvin]] and Estonian bassist [[Toivo Unt]] under the \"Art of Trio\" name, performing in a variety of venues in Finland, Sweden, and the Baltic states, and performing with Estonian vocalist Jaanika Ventsel, while also touring and recording in Japan for the duo project with bassist Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4|\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4]]), their duo CD \"[[Agana]]\" was released in February 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Kawasaki formed jazz ensemble with Estonian pianist/keyboardist [[T\u00f5nu Naissoo]].<ref>[http://www.tonunaissoo.com]</ref> Also, his second duo CD with Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4|\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4]]) and first CD with \"Art of Trio\" were completed and released during 2009, while his composition \"Raisins\" was included on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' radio station Fusion FM in 2008.\n\nFrom 2009 - 2011, Kawasaki further expanded his performing activities in Lebanon with Syrian bassist, Omar Harb and Lebanese drummer, Fouad Afra. The album \"Live in Beirut\" which Kawasaki recorded with Lebanese organist, Arthur Satyan and drummer, Fouad Afra was released in 2011.\n\nOverlapping the same time period, beginning in 2007, Kawasaki gradually developed his 4th acoustic guitar solo album \"Spain\" in Tallinn, Estonia, which was finally released in 2012.\nIn 2014, Ryo discovered a younger generation of Estonian musicians who inspired him to further develop a fusion, jazz-rock sound using his own compositions. Ryo's attention on these directions had somewhat faded away after their recording and release in the early 1980s with his group \"Golden Dragon\". As of spring 2016, Kawasaki has formed a new quartet called, \"Level 8\" exclusively with Estonian musicians: keyboardist, Raun Juurikas; electric bassist, Kaarel Liiv; and drummer, Eno Kollom. \"Level 8\" has now finished recording a new self-titled album focusing on Ryo's compositions both from the past and present utilizing a funk/fusion/jazz-rock sound. The album \"Level 8\" was released in March 2017.\n\nIn April 2016, UK independent label Nunorthernsoul released a vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works 1979 to 1983 by Ryo Kawasaki.\" A follow-up vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works Part 2 - 1976 to 1980 by Ryo Kawasaki\" is scheduled to be released in April 2017.\n\nHe died in Tallinn, Estonia in April 2020 at the age of 73.<ref>[https://kultuur.err.ee/1076803/suri-ryo-kawasaki Suri Ryo Kawasaki]</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===As leader===\n* ''Easy Listening Jazz Guitar'' ([[Polydor Records|Polydor]], 1970)\n* ''Gut's the Guitar'' (Toshiba, 1972)\n* ''[[Prism (Ryo Kawasaki album)|Prism]]'' ([[East Wind Records|East Wind]], 1975)\n* ''[[Eight Mile Road (Ryo Kawasaki album)|Eight Mile Road]]'' (East Wind, 1976)\n* ''Juice'' ([[RCA Records|RCA]], 1976)\n* ''[[Ring Toss (Ryo Kawasaki album)|Ring Toss]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Nature's Revenge]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Mirror of My Mind]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Little Tree (Ryo Kawasaki album) | Little Tree]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Live (Ryo Kawasaki album) | Live]]'' (1980)\n* ''Sapporo'' (1980)\n* ''Ryo'' (1982)\n* ''Lucky Lady'' (1983)\n* ''Images'' (1987)\n* ''Here, There and Everywhere'' (1992)\n* ''My Reverie'' (1993)\n* ''Love Within the Universe'' (1994)\n* ''Remixes Vol.1.''

His album ''Ryo Kawasaki and the Golden Dragon Live'' was one of the first all digital recordings and he created the [[Kawasaki Synthesizer]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. During the 1960s, he played with various Japanese jazz groups and also formed his own bands. In the early 1970s, he moved to New York City, where he settled and worked with [[Gil Evans]], [[Elvin Jones]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[Ted Curson]], [[Joanne Brackeen]] amongst others. In the mid-1980s, Kawasaki drifted out of performing music in favour of writing music software for computers. He also produced several techno dance singles, formed his own record company called Satellites Records, and later returned to jazz-fusion in 1991.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life (1947\u20131968)===\nRyo Kawasaki was born on February 25, 1947, in [[K\u014denji]], Tokyo, while Japan was still struggling and recovering from the early post World War II period. His father, Torao Kawasaki, was a Japanese [[diplomat]] who had worked for The [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] since 1919. Torao worked at several Japanese consulates and embassies, including San Francisco, [[Honolulu]], Fengtian (then capital of [[Manchuria]], now [[Shenyang]] in China), [[Shanghai]], and [[Beijing]] while active as an English teacher and translator for official diplomatic conferences. Ryo's mother, Hiroko, was also multilingual, and spoke German, Russian, English, and Chinese aside from her native tongue Japanese. Hiroko grew up in [[Manchuria]] and then met Torao in [[Shanghai]]. Torao was already 58 years old when Ryo was born as an only child.\n\nKawasaki's mother encouraged him to take piano and ballet lessons, and he took voice lessons and [[solfege]] at age four and violin lessons at five, and was reading music before elementary school. As a grade scholar, he began a lifelong fascination with [[astronomy]] and electronics (he built his own radios, TVs and audio systems including amplifiers and speakers as well as telescopes). When Ryo was 10, he bought a [[ukulele]] and, at 14, he got his first [[acoustic guitar]]. The album ''Midnight Blue'' by [[Kenny Burrell]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]] inspired Ryo to study jazz.\n\nIn high school, he began hanging out at coffee-houses that featured live music, formed a jazz ensemble and built an [[electronic organ]] that served as a primitive [[synthesizer]]. By the time he was 16, his band was playing professionally in cabarets and strip joints. Although he continued to play music regularly, he attended Nippon University, majored in [[quantum physics]] and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] Degree. Although he has failed to prove his main interest and intuitive belief at that time, which is to prove that speed (acceleration) of gravity must be much greater than speed of light. He also did some teaching and contest judging at the [[Yamaha]] musical instrument manufacturer's jazz school. Additionally he worked as a [[sound engineer]] for Japanese [[Victor Records]] and [[Gazell|BGM]]/[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] Music where he learned [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and editing.\n\n===Early career in Japan (1969\u20131973)===\nHe recorded his first solo album for [[Polydor Records]] when he was 22. Although he continued to perform with his jazz group, and at a young age was voted the No.&nbsp;3 [[jazz guitarist]] in a Japanese jazz poll, Kawasaki spent most of the next three years working as [[studio musician]] on everything from advertising jingles to pop songs including countless radio and TV appearances. He recorded his second album for [[Toshiba]] when he was 24. He played with [[B.B. King]] at a blues festival and also met [[George Benson]] (they jammed for five hours at Kawasaki's house).\n\nHe also has recorded and worked with notable Japanese jazz musicians such as drummer Takeshi Inomata and Sound limits, saxophonist Jiro Inagaki and Soul Mates, saxophonist Keiichiro Ebisawa, saxophonist Seiichi Nakamura, pianist Masahiko Sato ([[:ja:\u4f50\u85e4\u5141\u5f66|\u4f50\u85e4\u5141\u5f66]]), saxophonist Hidehiko Matsumoto ([[:ja:\u677e\u672c\u82f1\u5f66|\u677e\u672c\u82f1\u5f66]]) and many others.\n\n===Developments in New York City (1973\u20132002)===\n\n====1973\u20131979 (as guitarist)====\n[[File:Ryo-gil.jpg|thumb|Ryo Kawasaki with [[Gil Evans]] at Sweet Basil in New York City, 1982]]\n[[File:David Williams, Elvin Jones and Ryo Kawasaki.jpg|right|thumb|David Williams, [[Elvin Jones]] and Kawasaki in Rochester, N.Y. 1976]]\nIn 1973, Kawasaki arrived in New York. A friend picked him up at the airport and offered him an immediate gig with [[Joe Lee Wilson]] playing at the [[Lincoln Center]] as part of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. Soon Kawasaki was jamming regularly as part of the jazz community's \"loft scene\", and was invited to play with [[Bobbi Humphrey]]. A few months later, Kawasaki walked up to his apartment and found a stranger waiting for him at his front door. It was [[Gil Evans]] and he invited Kawasaki to join The Gil Evans Orchestra ([[David Sanborn]], [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], [[Lew Soloff]]) which was then working on a jazz recording of [[Jimi Hendrix]] compositions, ''[[The Gil Evans Orchestra Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix]]''. Hendrix had dreamed up the concept with Evans, but Jimi died a week before the project started in 1970. Kawasaki also played on another Gil Evans album on [[RCA Records|RCA]], ''[[There Comes a Time (album)|There Comes a Time]]'', with [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] on drums. Kawasaki rehearsed for a month with the third edition of Tony Williams' Lifetime with trio format with bassist [[Doug Rauch]] working with [[Carlos Santana]] at that time, but Tony left to spend a year in Europe before the band got the chance to perform in public.\n\nKawasaki followed in the footsteps of [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]] and [[Larry Coryell]] by becoming the [[guitarist]] in the [[Chico Hamilton]] Band, playing on a U.S. tour and working on various film scores that Chico recorded in [[Hollywood]]. Kawasaki made his debut U.S. album, ''Juice'', in 1976 for RCA and was one of the first Japanese jazz artists to sign with a major label in the States. Sidemen on the project included [[Tom Coster]] ([[Carlos Santana]]) and [[Sam Morrison]] ([[Miles Davis]]). Kawasaki followed that recording with two more albums, ''Prism'' and ''Eight Mile Road'', for the Japanese [[record label|label]] East Wind. He also joined the [[Elvin Jones]] Band for a year-long tour of North and South America and Europe. By 1978, Kawasaki was tired of touring with other bands and returned to his own projects.\n\nHe explored [[Music of India]], learned [[ragas]] and recorded an Audio Fidelity album, Ring Toss, that combined eastern and western music. With [[Dave Liebman]] he recorded Nature's Revenge for the German [[MPS Records|MPS]] [[label]] and they toured Europe. Ryo also toured European jazz festivals with [[Joanne Brackeen]] as piano \u2013 guitar duo, and they recorded a pair of albums\u2014AFT and Trinkets and Things\u2014for Timeless Records in the Netherlands. In Japan, [[Sony]]'s Open Sky label signed Ryo for three albums\u2014Mirror of my Mind, Little Tree and Live\u2014the latter, recorded in a Tokyo club, was one of the first all-digital recordings. Notable musicians participated on those recordings include [[Michael Brecker]], [[Harvey Mason]], [[Leon Pendarvis]], [[Azar Lawrence]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], [[Lincoln Goines]], [[Badal Roy]], [[Nana Vasconcelos]], [[Buddy Williams (jazz drummer)|Buddy Williams]], [[Larry Willis]], and [[Alex Blake]]. He also recorded an album called ''Sapporo'' for Swiss label America Sound in 1980 while touring Switzerland and Germany.\n\n====1979\u20131990 (as inventor and programmer)====\nKawasaki invented his own [[guitar synthesizer]] in 1979, and used it to perform numerous solo shows at [[planetarium]]s from 1980 to 1983. He also formed the jazz-rock group The Golden Dragon and performed concerts regularly in early 1980s. [[Fostex]] developed the first quarter- inch-tape, eight-track recorder called A8 along with 2 track mastering machine A2 and asked Kawasaki to be the first artist to use it. He recorded the album Ryo in 1981 for [[Philips Records]] and gained notoriety for creating all the music himself. He played only a nylon-string acoustic guitar with all his backing tracks created on his guitar synthesizer including the entire original [[orchestration]] of [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s well known [[Concierto de Aranjuez]] \u2013 [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] movement. He did another similar recording, Lucky Lady, the next year.\n\nWhen the [[Commodore 64]] computer came out with a sound-chip in it, Kawasaki became fascinated by the possibilities. He learned to write [[computer programs]] and devoted 16 hours a day for two years creating four [[Music video game#Free form music games|music software programs]]\u2014''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker|Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Magical Musiquill|Kawasaki Magical Musicquill]]'', and ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki MIDI Workstation|Kawasaki MIDI Workstation]]''\u2014distributed by Sight and Sound Music. The first three programs were for school and home use, and the last one was for professional studios. He created an all-synthesized album, ''Images'', in 1987; and the soundtrack, Pleasure Garden, in 1990, for an [[IMAX]] film about the preservation of the Earth's endangered tropical rain forests.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1990, Kawasaki produced a series of high-charting [[12 inch single|12 inch]] dance  singles\u2014\"Electric World\", \"One Kiss\", \"No Expectations\", \"Say Baby I Love You\", \"Don't Tell Me\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Life is The Rhythm\", \"Pleasure Garden\", and \"Acid Heat\"\u2014that mixed free-style, house, acid house and ambient sounds. All of the production was done at his home studio, The Satellite Station, and the records were released on his own label, Satellites Records. His band and a dance troupe also performed extensively in New York dance clubs. In addition, for five years (1988 to 1993), Kawasaki was the New York producer and director of two Japanese national weekly music radio programs, ''The Music Now'' and ''Idex Music Jam''. In 1991. He also collaborated with Japanese [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] master Kicho Takano and produced \"Crystallization\" in 1986.\n\n====1991\u20132000 (return to jazz guitarist)====\nKawasaki's musical direction took another dramatic turn when he was signed by the new jazz and adult contemporary Japanese label One Voice as an artist and record producer. Kawasaki's return to jazz, and his first album for the label, was the 1992 acoustic solo guitar album ''[[Here, There and Everywhere]]'' (released on One Voice in Japan and on Satellites Records in the U.S.). Kawasaki has produced and performed on three albums by Brazilian singer and guitarist [[Camila Benson]] for this label. Ryo has continued to release a steady string of albums\u2014the acoustic ''My Reverie'' (music from [[Bill Evans]], [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]] and [[Gershwin]]), the electric jazz guitar-oriented ''Love Within The Universe'' (which received considerable airplay across the country), \"Remixes Remixes Vol. 1\" (also featuring Benson), \"Sweet Life\" and CD releases of \"Mirror of my Mind\" (a jazz ensemble recording with [[Harvey Mason]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], Leon Pendarvis and vocalist Radha Shottam).\n\nHis 1999 release ''Cosmic Rhythm'' features British singer lyricist [[Clare Foster]] along with Kawasaki's rhythm section Victor Jones on drums, [[Lincoln Goines]] on bass. The album also features [[David Kikoski]] on piano and [[Shunzo Ohno]] on flugelhorn. All the songs were arranged and recorded by Kawasaki including original ten songs by Ro himself.\n\nDuring 1995\u20131999, three [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists, [[Puff Daddy]], [[Kool G Rap]], and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], recorded Kawasaki's original composition \"[[Bamboo Child]]\" on their latest albums more than twenty years after its original recording.\n\n===Developments in Estonia and beyond (2000\u20132020)===\nIn 2001, Kawasaki released live a studio trio album \"Reval\", recorded in [[Tallinn]], Estonia with Estonian musicians [[Toivo Unt]] on bass, [[Aivar Vassiljev]] on drums, and Kristi Keel on [[English horn]].\n\nHis other projects include being a composer, music director as well as a guitarist for the jazz ballet \"Still Point\" for the Estonian National Opera House during 2000-2002. This ballet is choreographed by [[Russell Adamson]], a native Jamaican who resides in [[Helsinki]].\n\nKawasaki released his third [[acoustic guitar]] solo album 'E' in 2002.\n\nFrom the year 2000 on, Kawasaki further expanded his live appearances into Russia and [[Baltic region]] Jazz Festivals. His quartet has appeared at Rigas Ritmi Jazz Festival in [[Riga]]/[[Latvia]], [[Pori Jazz|Pori]] and other jazz festivals in Finland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and [[Saransk]] Jazz Ark Festival. He also appeared numerous times at [[N\u00f5mme]] Jazz Festival in Estonia while assisting the production of this jazz festival.\n\nKawasaki's projects during 2005\u20132008 included guitar trio project with American drummer [[Brian Melvin]] and Estonian bassist [[Toivo Unt]] under the \"Art of Trio\" name, performing in a variety of venues in Finland, Sweden, and the Baltic states, and performing with Estonian vocalist Jaanika Ventsel, while also touring and recording in Japan for the duo project with bassist Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4|\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4]]), their duo CD \"[[Agana]]\" was released in February 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Kawasaki formed jazz ensemble with Estonian pianist/keyboardist [[T\u00f5nu Naissoo]].<ref>[http://www.tonunaissoo.com]</ref> Also, his second duo CD with Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4|\u9234\u6728\u826f\u96c4]]) and first CD with \"Art of Trio\" were completed and released during 2009, while his composition \"Raisins\" was included on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' radio station Fusion FM in 2008.\n\nFrom 2009 - 2011, Kawasaki further expanded his performing activities in Lebanon with Syrian bassist, Omar Harb and Lebanese drummer, Fouad Afra. The album \"Live in Beirut\" which Kawasaki recorded with Lebanese organist, Arthur Satyan and drummer, Fouad Afra was released in 2011.\n\nOverlapping the same time period, beginning in 2007, Kawasaki gradually developed his 4th acoustic guitar solo album \"Spain\" in Tallinn, Estonia, which was finally released in 2012.\nIn 2014, Ryo discovered a younger generation of Estonian musicians who inspired him to further develop a fusion, jazz-rock sound using his own compositions. Ryo's attention on these directions had somewhat faded away after their recording and release in the early 1980s with his group \"Golden Dragon\". As of spring 2016, Kawasaki has formed a new quartet called, \"Level 8\" exclusively with Estonian musicians: keyboardist, Raun Juurikas; electric bassist, Kaarel Liiv; and drummer, Eno Kollom. \"Level 8\" has now finished recording a new self-titled album focusing on Ryo's compositions both from the past and present utilizing a funk/fusion/jazz-rock sound. The album \"Level 8\" was released in March 2017.\n\nIn April 2016, UK independent label Nunorthernsoul released a vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works 1979 to 1983 by Ryo Kawasaki.\" A follow-up vinyl EP titled \"Selected Works Part 2 - 1976 to 1980 by Ryo Kawasaki\" is scheduled to be released in April 2017.\n\nHe died in Tallinn, Estonia in April 2020 at the age of 73.<ref>[https://kultuur.err.ee/1076803/suri-ryo-kawasaki Suri Ryo Kawasaki]</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===As leader===\n* ''Easy Listening Jazz Guitar'' ([[Polydor Records|Polydor]], 1970)\n* ''Gut's the Guitar'' (Toshiba, 1972)\n* ''[[Prism (Ryo Kawasaki album)|Prism]]'' ([[East Wind Records|East Wind]], 1975)\n* ''[[Eight Mile Road (Ryo Kawasaki album)|Eight Mile Road]]'' (East Wind, 1976)\n* ''Juice'' ([[RCA Records|RCA]], 1976)\n* ''[[Ring Toss (Ryo Kawasaki album)|Ring Toss]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Nature's Revenge]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Mirror of My Mind]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Little Tree (Ryo Kawasaki album) | Little Tree]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Live (Ryo Kawasaki album) | Live]]'' (1980)\n* ''Sapporo'' (1980)\n* ''Ryo'' (1982)\n* ''Lucky Lady'' (1983)\n* ''Images'' (1987)\n* ''Here, There and Everywhere'' (1992)\n* ''My Reverie'' (1993)\n* ''Love Within the Universe'' (1994)\n* ''Remixes Vol.1.''
