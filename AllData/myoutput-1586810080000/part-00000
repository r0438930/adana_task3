The disc and triangles symbolize the sun and rays of light emanating from it respectively.\n\nThe flag was originally designed by the anti-Qing group, [[Revive China Society]] in 1894 with the addition of the red field component in 1906 by Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] in speech.\n\nIt was first used in [[mainland China]] as the Navy flag in 1912,<ref name=\"ROCN\">Official gazette of Ministry of the Navy of Republic of China, July 1912, page 344, [http://twinfo.ncl.edu.tw/tiqry/hypage.cgi?HYPAGE=search/merge_pdf.hpg&sysid=E10D4656&jid=00227485&type=g&vol=01070000&page=%E9%A0%81342-353 pdf], National Central Library - Gazette Online</ref> and was made the official [[national flag]] of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) in 1928 by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT). It was enshrined in the sixth article of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] when it was promulgated in 1947. The flag is no longer officially used in mainland China, as the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded in 1949.\n\nAs the islands of [[island of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]] were [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]] until 1945, the flag was not in use in two territories, until ROC took control in 1945. The flag is now mostly used within [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and other outlying islands, [[Free area of the Republic of China|where the ROC relocated to]] in 1949 after its defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Flag of the Qing dynasty|Flag of China}}\n[[File:Flag of Chinese Taipei for Olympic games.svg|thumb|left|The [[Chinese Taipei flag|Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee flag]] (known in Chinese as the 'Plum Blossom Banner') is used in place of the flag of the Republic of China at the [[Olympic Games]] and in some sporting events.]]\nThe first national flag of Taiwan was first used in 1663 during the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] which had a plain white flag with the character \"\u912d\" (''zh\u00e8ng'') on the red bordered circle. The [[flag of the Qing dynasty]] was also used from 1683 until 1895 when the [[Republic of Formosa]] was declared. The Formosan flag had a tiger on a plain blue filed with azure clouds below it.\n\nDuring Japanese rule of Taiwan, the [[flag of Japan]] was flown in the island from 1895 to 1945. At the same time, when the government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] was established on 1 January 1912, the \"Five-Colored Flag\" was selected by the provisional Senate as the national flag.

The twelve rays of the white [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun]] symbolize the twelve [[month]]s and the twelve traditional ''[[Chinese units of measurement#Time|shichen]]'' ({{zh|t=\u6642\u8fb0|p=sh\u00edch\u00e9n|labels=no}}), a traditional unit of time which corresponds to two modern [[hour]]s. Sun Yat-sen added the \"Red Earth\" to the flag to signify the [[blood]] of the revolutionaries who sacrificed themselves in order to overthrow the [[Qing Dynasty]] and create the ROC. Together, the three colors of the flag correspond to the [[Three Principles of the People]]: [[Blue]] represents [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]] and liberty; [[White]] represents [[democracy]] and equality; and [[Red]] represents the people's livelihood and fraternity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.president.gov.tw/Default.aspx?tabid=441 |title=National Flag |author=Office of the President |authorlink=President of the Republic of China |year=2011 |publisher=Republic of China (Taiwan) |accessdate=7 August 2011 }}</ref> President Chiang Kai-shek proclaimed on the [[Double Ten Day|National Day]] in 1929, \"As long as a national flag with Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flies on the land of China, it symbolises the independence and liberty of the [[Yan Huang Zisun|descendants of the Huang Emperor]]\".\n\nThe blue-and-white canton of the ROC flag is often used as the party flag of the KMT. The flag has developed a great deal of additional symbolism due to the unique and controversial [[political status of Taiwan]]. At one level, the flag represents a clear symbol that Taiwan is not governed by the same government as Mainland China, as this flag is different from the [[Flag of China|flag of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC).\n\nMeanwhile, because it was formerly used as the flag over all of China, the flag has become a symbol of continuity with the ideals of the [[Chinese nationalism]] and [[Chinese reunification]] movements, and has become a symbol of a connection both historical and current with mainland China. In addition, the flag is derived from the seal of the KMT, and the color of the field of the flag is associated with the KMT party colors.\n\nSome Chinese see the flag as an expression of [[Chinese nationalism]] and pride combined with simultaneous disapproval for the current communist regime. Additionally, the flag may symbolize identification with, and admiration for the political thoughts of [[Sun Yat-sen]], and his [[Three Principles of the People]].\n\nOne irony is that given the association of the flag with [[Chinese nationalism]] in opposition to [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]], the ROC flag has found an unexpected ally in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. The PRC has criticized Taiwan independence groups for wishing to change or abolish the ROC flag, and has implied that legal steps to do so would bring a strongly negative reaction from the PRC.\n\nHowever, the presence of the ROC flag in Taiwan also distinguishes the fact that Taiwan and ROC territorial islands elsewhere fall under jurisdiction of a country separate from that of [[mainland China]], the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]]. The hoisting of the ROC flag is even advocated by the most extreme Taiwanese independence supporters, such as [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] members when emphasizing the separate and independently governed systems and territories of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] and the People's Republic of China in mainland China.\n\n== Construction details ==\n[[File:Flag of the Republic of China construction sheet.svg|thumb|National flag construction sheet (Chinese).]]\n[[File:Flag of the Republic of China canton construction sheet.svg|thumb|Design for the canton (Chinese).]]\n[[File:Republic of China(Taiwan) sheet.svg|thumb|National flag construction sheet.]]\nThe specific designs of the flag are located in the \"Law about the national flag and emblem of the Republic of China.\" The ratio of the flag is 2:3, with most of it being red. One-fourth of the flag is blue, which contains the 12 pointed sun. Each sun ray is 30 degrees, so the total sun rays will make up a complete 360 degree circle. Inside the sun, the blue ring is the diameter of the white sun divided by 15.<ref name=\"flaglaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqf.htm |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u570b\u5fbd\u570b\u65d7\u6cd5 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref>\n\nIn later years, more specifics of the [[Flag terminology|canton]] area (also used as the flag of the KMT), were codified into law. In the drawing released in \"Law on the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Methods\" ({{lang|zh|\u9ee8\u65d7\u570b\u65d7\u4e4b\u88fd\u9020\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u8fa6\u6cd5}}), the sun was drawn in more specific detail and mathematical values were given to all elements in the flag. In the law, the canton still had a ratio of 2:3, but the math values given were 24x36 meters. The diameter of the sun with rays is {{frac|6|8}} of height of the canton, so in this case, it will be 18. The diameter of the white sun without the sun rays is {{frac|4}} of the width of the canton, so it is 9. The blue ring that is on top of this sun and part of the rays is {{frac|15}} diameter of the white sun, so the size will be 0.6. The angle of the rays, 30 degrees, and the total number of rays have not changed.<ref name=\"kmtflaglaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqfggy.htm#zzjsybf |script-title=zh:\u9ee8\u65d7\u570b\u65d7\u4e4b\u88fd\u9020\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u8fa6\u6cd5 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=2006-05-19 |language=Chinese }}</ref>\n\nThe colors of the national flag are dark red, white and dark blue.

A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of [[Father of the Nation]] [[Sun Yat-sen]] displayed in the center. For the summits held between the KMT and [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC flag was displayed at an equal position to the flag of the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] (Jiangxi Soviet). Later, the flag law specified a horizontal display of the flag with the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in a portion of the red field at the center position. This display can be found in numerous government offices in Taiwan and is that which the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] and [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] face to take the oath of office.\n\nThe flag has a ubiquitous presence in Taiwan. The hoisting and lowering of the flag are ceremoniously accompanied by the [[National Banner Song]] while those present stand at attention to give a standard [[salute]] with the right hand, held flat, to the right eyebrow. Schoolchildren have traditionally been required to attend morning rallies where the flag is raised after a rendition of the ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]''. Before [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was lifted in 1987 in Taiwan, it was required that all vehicles be halted when passing by a flag ceremony.\n\nThe ROC flag is not commonly seen at international gatherings in which the PRC participates due to pressure from the PRC over the [[political status of Taiwan]] and resulting minimal political influence of the ROC in such circles. Instead, the ROC is usually represented under a [[pseudonym]] (usually \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\") and in the case of Olympics, it flies its own flag, the [[Chinese Taipei flag]]. This is because the IOC recognises the PRC's position that the ROC is a defunct entity and that the ROC on Taiwan is illegitimate. The ban also effectively applies to spectators&mdash;during a [[Table Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Table Tennis final]] match at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]], police arrested a Taiwanese student for waving the ROC flag.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwanese spectators arrested |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=1996-09-01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/olympics/daily/tableten/aug/1/arrest.htm }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the symbolism of the flag began to shift in the early 21st century{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} as there was a warming of relations between the [[pan-Blue coalition]] in Taiwan and the [[Communist Party of China]] on mainland China. The flag of the Republic of China has begun to symbolize the existence of a past and possibly future unified China, and as such the government of the PRC has made it clear that for Taiwan to change the flag would be a major provocation in favor of [[Taiwan independence]]. The ambiguity surrounding the flag was made apparent during the trip of Kuomintang Chairman [[Lien Chan]] to mainland China in April 2005, during which the flag was very prominently displayed at ceremonies honoring [[Sun Yat-Sen]] at which both KMT party officials and government officials from the PRC were in attendance. One place in Mainland China where the White Sun emblem is still prominently displayed in public is the ceiling mosaic within [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in Nanjing.\n\nThe use of the flag in Taiwan reflects the controversy behind its symbolism. Although supporters of [[Taiwan independence]], such as former President [[Chen Shui-bian]], will display and salute the flag on formal official state occasions, it is never seen at political rallies of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. This is not only because of its association with mainland China but also because the flag contains design elements of the KMT party flag. By contrast, the ROC flag is always extremely prominent at political rallies of the [[pan-Blue coalition]]. This difference extends to the colors seen at the rallies. Rallies of the pan-Blue coalition give prominence to the colors of the ROC flag, with very large amounts of blue and smaller amounts of red. Rallies of independence-leaning parties are filled with green, with no blue or red at all.\n\nSome supporters of Taiwan independence, including former president [[Lee Teng-hui]], have called for the abandonment of the flag, and there are a number of alternate [[Proposed flags of Taiwan|designs for a specifically Taiwanese flag]]. However, the prospects for this are not high given that changing the flag requires a constitutional amendment; that the current flag has a huge amount of support among pan-Blue supporters and grudging acceptance among moderate independence supporters; and because changing the flag might cause political tension with the PRC. During the 2004 ROC legislative elections, it was briefly suggested that if the pan-green coalition won the elections that it would force the KMT to change the party emblem to be different from the flag. This proposal generated a few days of controversy and was then quickly forgotten.\n\n==Incidents==\nDuring a concert in [[Manchester]] in November 2013, singer [[Deserts Chang]] held on the flag of the ROC to the audience sparking protests from the PRC, which led to its cancellation of her concert in [[Beijing]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/taiwan/10432084/Taiwan-singer-upsets-China-with-flag-stunt.Taiwan singer upsets China with flag stunt] - ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. 7 November 2013.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, in November 2015, singer [[Chou Tzu-yu]] appeared with [[Twice (band)|Twice]] on the South Korean variety show ''[[My Little Television]]''.

terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|canton]] bearing a white disc with twelve triangles surrounding it. The disc and triangles symbolize the sun and rays of light emanating from it respectively.\n\nThe flag was originally designed by the anti-Qing group, [[Revive China Society]] in 1894 with the addition of the red field component in 1906 by Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] in speech.\n\nIt was first used in [[mainland China]] as the Navy flag in 1912,<ref name=\"ROCN\">Official gazette of Ministry of the Navy of Republic of China, July 1912, page 344, [http://twinfo.ncl.edu.tw/tiqry/hypage.cgi?HYPAGE=search/merge_pdf.hpg&sysid=E10D4656&jid=00227485&type=g&vol=01070000&page=%E9%A0%81342-353 pdf], National Central Library - Gazette Online</ref> and was made the official [[national flag]] of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) in 1928 by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT). It was enshrined in the sixth article of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] when it was promulgated in 1947. The flag is no longer officially used in mainland China, as the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded in 1949.\n\nAs the islands of [[island of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]] were [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]] until 1945, the flag was not in use in two territories, until ROC took control in 1945. The flag is now mostly used within [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and other outlying islands, [[Free area of the Republic of China|where the ROC relocated to]] in 1949 after its defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Flag of the Qing dynasty|Flag of China}}\n[[File:Flag of Chinese Taipei for Olympic games.svg|thumb|left|The [[Chinese Taipei flag|Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee flag]] (known in Chinese as the 'Plum Blossom Banner') is used in place of the flag of the Republic of China at the [[Olympic Games]] and in some sporting events.]]\nThe first national flag of Taiwan was first used in 1663 during the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] which had a plain white flag with the character \"\u912d\" (''zh\u00e8ng'') on the red bordered circle. The [[flag of the Qing dynasty]] was also used from 1683 until 1895 when the [[Republic of Formosa]] was declared. The Formosan flag had a tiger on a plain blue filed with azure clouds below it.\n\nDuring Japanese rule of Taiwan, the [[flag of Japan]] was flown in the island from 1895 to 1945. At the same time, when the government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] was established on 1 January 1912, the \"Five-Colored Flag\" was selected by the provisional Senate as the national flag.

Sun Yat-sen added the \"Red Earth\" to the flag to signify the [[blood]] of the revolutionaries who sacrificed themselves in order to overthrow the [[Qing Dynasty]] and create the ROC. Together, the three colors of the flag correspond to the [[Three Principles of the People]]: [[Blue]] represents [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]] and liberty; [[White]] represents [[democracy]] and equality; and [[Red]] represents the people's livelihood and fraternity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.president.gov.tw/Default.aspx?tabid=441 |title=National Flag |author=Office of the President |authorlink=President of the Republic of China |year=2011 |publisher=Republic of China (Taiwan) |accessdate=7 August 2011 }}</ref> President Chiang Kai-shek proclaimed on the [[Double Ten Day|National Day]] in 1929, \"As long as a national flag with Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flies on the land of China, it symbolises the independence and liberty of the [[Yan Huang Zisun|descendants of the Huang Emperor]]\".\n\nThe blue-and-white canton of the ROC flag is often used as the party flag of the KMT. The flag has developed a great deal of additional symbolism due to the unique and controversial [[political status of Taiwan]]. At one level, the flag represents a clear symbol that Taiwan is not governed by the same government as Mainland China, as this flag is different from the [[Flag of China|flag of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC).\n\nMeanwhile, because it was formerly used as the flag over all of China, the flag has become a symbol of continuity with the ideals of the [[Chinese nationalism]] and [[Chinese reunification]] movements, and has become a symbol of a connection both historical and current with mainland China. In addition, the flag is derived from the seal of the KMT, and the color of the field of the flag is associated with the KMT party colors.\n\nSome Chinese see the flag as an expression of [[Chinese nationalism]] and pride combined with simultaneous disapproval for the current communist regime. Additionally, the flag may symbolize identification with, and admiration for the political thoughts of [[Sun Yat-sen]], and his [[Three Principles of the People]].\n\nOne irony is that given the association of the flag with [[Chinese nationalism]] in opposition to [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]], the ROC flag has found an unexpected ally in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. The PRC has criticized Taiwan independence groups for wishing to change or abolish the ROC flag, and has implied that legal steps to do so would bring a strongly negative reaction from the PRC.\n\nHowever, the presence of the ROC flag in Taiwan also distinguishes the fact that Taiwan and ROC territorial islands elsewhere fall under jurisdiction of a country separate from that of [[mainland China]], the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]]. The hoisting of the ROC flag is even advocated by the most extreme Taiwanese independence supporters, such as [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] members when emphasizing the separate and independently governed systems and territories of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] and the People's Republic of China in mainland China.\n\n== Construction details ==\n[[File:Flag of the Republic of China construction sheet.svg|thumb|National flag construction sheet (Chinese).]]\n[[File:Flag of the Republic of China canton construction sheet.svg|thumb|Design for the canton (Chinese).]]\n[[File:Republic of China(Taiwan) sheet.svg|thumb|National flag construction sheet.]]\nThe specific designs of the flag are located in the \"Law about the national flag and emblem of the Republic of China.\" The ratio of the flag is 2:3, with most of it being red. One-fourth of the flag is blue, which contains the 12 pointed sun. Each sun ray is 30 degrees, so the total sun rays will make up a complete 360 degree circle. Inside the sun, the blue ring is the diameter of the white sun divided by 15.<ref name=\"flaglaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqf.htm |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u570b\u5fbd\u570b\u65d7\u6cd5 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref>\n\nIn later years, more specifics of the [[Flag terminology|canton]] area (also used as the flag of the KMT), were codified into law. In the drawing released in \"Law on the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Methods\" ({{lang|zh|\u9ee8\u65d7\u570b\u65d7\u4e4b\u88fd\u9020\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u8fa6\u6cd5}}), the sun was drawn in more specific detail and mathematical values were given to all elements in the flag. In the law, the canton still had a ratio of 2:3, but the math values given were 24x36 meters. The diameter of the sun with rays is {{frac|6|8}} of height of the canton, so in this case, it will be 18. The diameter of the white sun without the sun rays is {{frac|4}} of the width of the canton, so it is 9. The blue ring that is on top of this sun and part of the rays is {{frac|15}} diameter of the white sun, so the size will be 0.6. The angle of the rays, 30 degrees, and the total number of rays have not changed.<ref name=\"kmtflaglaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqfggy.htm#zzjsybf |script-title=zh:\u9ee8\u65d7\u570b\u65d7\u4e4b\u88fd\u9020\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u8fa6\u6cd5 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=2006-05-19 |language=Chinese }}</ref>\n\nThe colors of the national flag are dark red, white and dark blue.

A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of [[Father of the Nation]] [[Sun Yat-sen]] displayed in the center. For the summits held between the KMT and [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC flag was displayed at an equal position to the flag of the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] (Jiangxi Soviet). Later, the flag law specified a horizontal display of the flag with the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in a portion of the red field at the center position. This display can be found in numerous government offices in Taiwan and is that which the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] and [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] face to take the oath of office.\n\nThe flag has a ubiquitous presence in Taiwan. The hoisting and lowering of the flag are ceremoniously accompanied by the [[National Banner Song]] while those present stand at attention to give a standard [[salute]] with the right hand, held flat, to the right eyebrow. Schoolchildren have traditionally been required to attend morning rallies where the flag is raised after a rendition of the ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]''. Before [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was lifted in 1987 in Taiwan, it was required that all vehicles be halted when passing by a flag ceremony.\n\nThe ROC flag is not commonly seen at international gatherings in which the PRC participates due to pressure from the PRC over the [[political status of Taiwan]] and resulting minimal political influence of the ROC in such circles. Instead, the ROC is usually represented under a [[pseudonym]] (usually \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\") and in the case of Olympics, it flies its own flag, the [[Chinese Taipei flag]]. This is because the IOC recognises the PRC's position that the ROC is a defunct entity and that the ROC on Taiwan is illegitimate. The ban also effectively applies to spectators&mdash;during a [[Table Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Table Tennis final]] match at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]], police arrested a Taiwanese student for waving the ROC flag.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwanese spectators arrested |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=1996-09-01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/olympics/daily/tableten/aug/1/arrest.htm }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the symbolism of the flag began to shift in the early 21st century{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} as there was a warming of relations between the [[pan-Blue coalition]] in Taiwan and the [[Communist Party of China]] on mainland China. The flag of the Republic of China has begun to symbolize the existence of a past and possibly future unified China, and as such the government of the PRC has made it clear that for Taiwan to change the flag would be a major provocation in favor of [[Taiwan independence]]. The ambiguity surrounding the flag was made apparent during the trip of Kuomintang Chairman [[Lien Chan]] to mainland China in April 2005, during which the flag was very prominently displayed at ceremonies honoring [[Sun Yat-Sen]] at which both KMT party officials and government officials from the PRC were in attendance. One place in Mainland China where the White Sun emblem is still prominently displayed in public is the ceiling mosaic within [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in Nanjing.\n\nThe use of the flag in Taiwan reflects the controversy behind its symbolism. Although supporters of [[Taiwan independence]], such as former President [[Chen Shui-bian]], will display and salute the flag on formal official state occasions, it is never seen at political rallies of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. This is not only because of its association with mainland China but also because the flag contains design elements of the KMT party flag. By contrast, the ROC flag is always extremely prominent at political rallies of the [[pan-Blue coalition]]. This difference extends to the colors seen at the rallies. Rallies of the pan-Blue coalition give prominence to the colors of the ROC flag, with very large amounts of blue and smaller amounts of red. Rallies of independence-leaning parties are filled with green, with no blue or red at all.\n\nSome supporters of Taiwan independence, including former president [[Lee Teng-hui]], have called for the abandonment of the flag, and there are a number of alternate [[Proposed flags of Taiwan|designs for a specifically Taiwanese flag]]. However, the prospects for this are not high given that changing the flag requires a constitutional amendment; that the current flag has a huge amount of support among pan-Blue supporters and grudging acceptance among moderate independence supporters; and because changing the flag might cause political tension with the PRC. During the 2004 ROC legislative elections, it was briefly suggested that if the pan-green coalition won the elections that it would force the KMT to change the party emblem to be different from the flag. This proposal generated a few days of controversy and was then quickly forgotten.\n\n==Incidents==\nDuring a concert in [[Manchester]] in November 2013, singer [[Deserts Chang]] held on the flag of the ROC to the audience sparking protests from the PRC, which led to its cancellation of her concert in [[Beijing]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/taiwan/10432084/Taiwan-singer-upsets-China-with-flag-stunt.Taiwan singer upsets China with flag stunt] - ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. 7 November 2013.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, in November 2015, singer [[Chou Tzu-yu]] appeared with [[Twice (band)|Twice]] on the South Korean variety show ''[[My Little Television]]''.
