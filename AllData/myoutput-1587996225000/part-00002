People chased the cat, but it disguised itself and left behind the thought of the cat becoming a monster. In the aforementioned \"Tsurezuregusa,\" in addition to nekomata that conceal themselves in the mountains, there are descriptions of pet cats that grow old, transform, and eat and abduct people.<ref name=\"\u5e73\u5ca91992\" />\n\nSince the Edo period, it has become generally believed that domestic cats turn into nekomata as they grow old, and  mountainous nekomata have come to be interpreted as cats that have run away to live in the mountains. As a result, throughout Japan a folk belief developed that cats should not be kept for long periods.<ref name=\"\u591a\u75302000\" />\n\nIn the \"{{nihongo|Ansai Zuihitsu|\u5b89\u658e\u968f\u7b46}}\" the courtier [[Sadatake Ise]] stated, \"A cat that is several years of age will come to have two tails, and become the y\u014dkai called nekomata.\" The mid-Edo period scholar [[Arai Hakuseki]] stated, \"Old cats become 'nekomata' and bewilder people.\" and indicated that at that time it was common  to believe that cats become nekomata. Even the Edo-period [[Kawaraban]] reported this strange phenomenon.<ref name=\"\u7b39\u95931994\" />\n\nIn the book ''Yamato Kaiiki'' ({{lang|ja|\u5927\u548c\u602a\u7570\u8a18}}, engl. \"Mysterious stories from Japan\"), written by an unknown author in 1708, one story speaks of a rich [[samurai]]'s haunted house where the inhabitants witnessed several [[poltergeist]] activities. Attempting to end those events, the samurai called upon countless [[shaman]]s, [[priest]]s and evokers; but none of them could locate the source of the terror. One day, one of the most loyal servants saw his master's aged cat carrying in its mouth a [[shikigami]] with the samurai's name imprinted on it. Immediately shooting a sacred arrow, the servant hit the cat in its head; and as it lay dead on the floor, everyone could see that the cat had two tails and therefore had become a nekomata. With its death, the poltergeist activities ended. Similar eerie stories about encounters with nekomata appear in books such as ''Taihei Hyakumonogatari'' ({{lang|ja|\u592a\u5e73\u767e\u7269\u8a9e}}, engl. ''Collection of 100 fairy tales''), written by Yusuke ({{lang|ja|\u7950\u4f50}}, or Y\u016bsa) in 1723 and in ''R\u014d\u014d Chabanashi'' ({{lang|ja|\u8001\u5abc\u8336\u8a71}}, ''Tea-time gossip of old ladies''), by Misaka Daiyata ({{lang|ja|\u4e09\u5742\u5927\u5f4c}}), 1742.\n\nIt is generally said that the \"mata\" (\u53c8) of \"nekomata\" refers to their having two tails; but from the perspective of [[folkloristics]], this appears questionable. Since nekomata transform as they age, \"mata\" meaning \"repetition\" is postulated. Alternatively, since they were once thought to be mountain beasts, there is a theory that \"mata\" (\u7230) refers to monkeys, since nekomata can come and go freely among the mountain trees.<ref>{{Cite book|author=\u65e5\u91ce\u5dcc|title=\u52d5\u7269\u5996\u602a\u8b5a|year=2006|publisher=\u4e2d\u592e\u516c\u8ad6\u65b0\u793e|series=\u4e2d\u516c\u6587\u5eab|isbn=978-4-12-204792-1|volume=\u4e0b|pages=158\u2013159}}</ref> There is also a theory that the term derives from the way in which cats that grow old shed the skin off their backs and hang downwards, making it appear that they have two tails.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nyanmaru.com/etc/index.html |title=\u30cd\u30b3\u306e\u3046\u3093\u3061\u304f|publisher=[http://nyanmaru.com/ \u30ab\u30d5\u30a7 \u306b\u3083\u3093\u307e\u308b]|accessdate=2012-11-03|archivedate=2012-11-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114103542/http://www.nyanmaru.com/etc/index.html}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan cats are often associated with death, and this particular spirit is often blamed. Far darker and more malevolent than most bakeneko, the nekomata is said to have powers of necromancy, and upon raising the dead, will control them with ritualistic dances, gesturing with paw and tail. These y\u014dkai are associated with strange fires and other inexplicable occurrences. The older and more abused a cat is prior to its transformation, the more power the nekomata is said to have. To gain revenge against those who wronged it, the spirit may haunt humans with visitations from their deceased relatives. Some tales state that these demons, like bakeneko, assume human appearances, usually appearing as older women, behaving badly in public, and bringing gloom and malevolence wherever they travel. Due to these beliefs, sometimes kittens' tails were cut off based on the assumption that if the tails could not fork, the cats could not become nekomata.\n\nFrom this discernment and strange characteristics, nekomata have been considered devilish from time immemorial. Due to fears and folk beliefs such as the dead resurrecting at a funeral, or that seven generations would be cursed as a result of killing a cat, it is thought that the legend of the nekomata was born.<ref name=\"\u77f3\u5ddd1986\" /><ref>{{Cite book|author=\u4f50\u91ce\u8ce2\u6cbb\u4ed6|editor=\u685c\u4e95\u5fb3\u592a\u90ce\u7de8|title=\u6c11\u9593\u4fe1\u4ef0\u8f9e\u5178|year=1980|publisher=\u6771\u4eac\u5802\u51fa\u7248|isbn=978-4-490-10137-9|page=223}}</ref> Also, in folk beliefs cats and the dead are related.

The nekomata was described as a mountain beast: according to the [[Meigetsuki]], \"They have eyes like a cat, and have a large body like a dog.\" The essay [[Tsurezuregusa]] from the late Kamakura period (circa 1331) asserts, \"{{nihongo|In the mountain recesses, there are those called nekomata, and people say that they eat humans...|\u5965\u5c71\u306b\u3001\u732b\u307e\u305f\u3068\u3044\u3075\u3082\u306e\u3042\u308a\u3066\u3001\u4eba\u3092\u98df\u3075\u306a\u308b\u3068\u4eba\u306e\u8a00\u3072\u3051\u308b\u306b\u2026\u2026}}.\"<ref name=\"\u7b39\u95931994\"/><ref name=\"\u5e73\u5ca91992\">\u5e73\u5ca9 (1992)\u300136\u201366\u9801\u3002</ref> However, many people question whether the nekomata really is a cat monster <ref name=\"\u7b39\u95931994\">\u7b39\u9593 (1994)\u3001127\u2013128\u9801\u3002</ref>.

In the \"{{nihongo|G\u016bis\u014d|\u5bd3\u610f\u8349}}\" of 1809 (Bunka 6), a nekomata that held a dog in its mouth was described as having a span of 9 shaku and 5 sun (about 2.8 meters).<ref name=\"\u7b39\u95931994\" />\n\nIn [[Etch\u016b Province]] (now [[Toyama Prefecture]]), in [[Aizu]], at [[Nekomatayama]] said to be where nekomata would devour humans (now [[Fukushima Prefecture]]), nekomata that shapeshift into humans and deceive people, like [[Mount Nekomadake]], the legends sometimes are named after the name of the associated mountain.<ref name=\"\u77f3\u5ddd1986\" /> Regarding Nekomatayama and altogether disregarding folklore, there are in fact large cats that attack humans.<ref>{{Cite book|author=\u8c37\u5ddd\u5065\u4e00|title=\u7d9a \u65e5\u672c\u306e\u5730\u540d|year=1998|publisher=\u5ca9\u6ce2\u66f8\u5e97|series=\u5ca9\u6ce2\u65b0\u66f8|isbn=978-4-00-430559-0|page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Domestic Cat Nekomata==\nAt the same time, in the [[Kokon Chomonj\u016b]] of the Kamakura period, in the story \"{{nihongo|Kanky\u014d H\u014din|\u89b3\u6559\u6cd5\u5370}}\", an old cat raised in a villa on a mountain precipice held a secret treasure, a protective sword, in its mouth and ran away. People chased the cat, but it disguised itself and left behind the thought of the cat becoming a monster. In the aforementioned \"Tsurezuregusa,\" in addition to nekomata that conceal themselves in the mountains, there are descriptions of pet cats that grow old, transform, and eat and abduct people.<ref name=\"\u5e73\u5ca91992\" />\n\nSince the Edo period, it has become generally believed that domestic cats turn into nekomata as they grow old, and  mountainous nekomata have come to be interpreted as cats that have run away to live in the mountains. As a result, throughout Japan a folk belief developed that cats should not be kept for long periods.<ref name=\"\u591a\u75302000\" />\n\nIn the \"{{nihongo|Ansai Zuihitsu|\u5b89\u658e\u968f\u7b46}}\" the courtier [[Sadatake Ise]] stated, \"A cat that is several years of age will come to have two tails, and become the y\u014dkai called nekomata.\" The mid-Edo period scholar [[Arai Hakuseki]] stated, \"Old cats become 'nekomata' and bewilder people.\" and indicated that at that time it was common  to believe that cats become nekomata. Even the Edo-period [[Kawaraban]] reported this strange phenomenon.<ref name=\"\u7b39\u95931994\" />\n\nIn the book ''Yamato Kaiiki'' ({{lang|ja|\u5927\u548c\u602a\u7570\u8a18}}, engl. \"Mysterious stories from Japan\"), written by an unknown author in 1708, one story speaks of a rich [[samurai]]'s haunted house where the inhabitants witnessed several [[poltergeist]] activities. Attempting to end those events, the samurai called upon countless [[shaman]]s, [[priest]]s and evokers; but none of them could locate the source of the terror. One day, one of the most loyal servants saw his master's aged cat carrying in its mouth a [[shikigami]] with the samurai's name imprinted on it. Immediately shooting a sacred arrow, the servant hit the cat in its head; and as it lay dead on the floor, everyone could see that the cat had two tails and therefore had become a nekomata. With its death, the poltergeist activities ended. Similar eerie stories about encounters with nekomata appear in books such as ''Taihei Hyakumonogatari'' ({{lang|ja|\u592a\u5e73\u767e\u7269\u8a9e}}, engl. ''Collection of 100 fairy tales''), written by Yusuke ({{lang|ja|\u7950\u4f50}}, or Y\u016bsa) in 1723 and in ''R\u014d\u014d Chabanashi'' ({{lang|ja|\u8001\u5abc\u8336\u8a71}}, ''Tea-time gossip of old ladies''), by Misaka Daiyata ({{lang|ja|\u4e09\u5742\u5927\u5f4c}}), 1742.\n\nIt is generally said that the \"mata\" (\u53c8) of \"nekomata\" refers to their having two tails; but from the perspective of [[folkloristics]], this appears questionable. Since nekomata transform as they age, \"mata\" meaning \"repetition\" is postulated. Alternatively, since they were once thought to be mountain beasts, there is a theory that \"mata\" (\u7230) refers to monkeys, since nekomata can come and go freely among the mountain trees.<ref>{{Cite book|author=\u65e5\u91ce\u5dcc|title=\u52d5\u7269\u5996\u602a\u8b5a|year=2006|publisher=\u4e2d\u592e\u516c\u8ad6\u65b0\u793e|series=\u4e2d\u516c\u6587\u5eab|isbn=978-4-12-204792-1|volume=\u4e0b|pages=158\u2013159}}</ref> There is also a theory that the term derives from the way in which cats that grow old shed the skin off their backs and hang downwards, making it appear that they have two tails.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nyanmaru.com/etc/index.html |title=\u30cd\u30b3\u306e\u3046\u3093\u3061\u304f|publisher=[http://nyanmaru.com/ \u30ab\u30d5\u30a7 \u306b\u3083\u3093\u307e\u308b]|accessdate=2012-11-03|archivedate=2012-11-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114103542/http://www.nyanmaru.com/etc/index.html}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan cats are often associated with death, and this particular spirit is often blamed. Far darker and more malevolent than most bakeneko, the nekomata is said to have powers of necromancy, and upon raising the dead, will control them with ritualistic dances, gesturing with paw and tail. These y\u014dkai are associated with strange fires and other inexplicable occurrences. The older and more abused a cat is prior to its transformation, the more power the nekomata is said to have. To gain revenge against those who wronged it, the spirit may haunt humans with visitations from their deceased relatives. Some tales state that these demons, like bakeneko, assume human appearances, usually appearing as older women, behaving badly in public, and bringing gloom and malevolence wherever they travel. Due to these beliefs, sometimes kittens' tails were cut off based on the assumption that if the tails could not fork, the cats could not become nekomata.\n\nFrom this discernment and strange characteristics, nekomata have been considered devilish from time immemorial. Due to fears and folk beliefs such as the dead resurrecting at a funeral, or that seven generations would be cursed as a result of killing a cat, it is thought that the legend of the nekomata was born.<ref name=\"\u77f3\u5ddd1986\" /><ref>{{Cite book|author=\u4f50\u91ce\u8ce2\u6cbb\u4ed6|editor=\u685c\u4e95\u5fb3\u592a\u90ce\u7de8|title=\u6c11\u9593\u4fe1\u4ef0\u8f9e\u5178|year=1980|publisher=\u6771\u4eac\u5802\u51fa\u7248|isbn=978-4-490-10137-9|page=223}}</ref> Also, in folk beliefs cats and the dead are related.
