Operations on this section and the additional services provided by [[Regionalbahn]] service RB 35 (''Der Weseler'') have since been operated as part of the [[Rhein-IJssel-Express]] (RE 19).\n\n==History ==\nThe ''Rhein-Express'' was established in 1998 with the introduction of the integrated regular interval timetable in North Rhine-Westphalia (called ''NRW-Takt'') by combining two services that previously started or finished in Cologne. Originally, the RE 5 service stopped at almost all intermediate stations, as if it were a [[Regionalbahn]] service.\n\nIn December 2002, several intermediate stops and all overtaking by long-distance trains were eliminated, and the scheduled top speed was increased to 160&nbsp;km/h, shortening the journey time by over 30 minutes between Cologne and Koblenz. The acceleration and the simultaneous thinning of services between Emmerich and Wesel reduced the number of sets of vehicles that was required for the circulation from nine to seven.\n\nHourly services of the ''Rhein-Express'' were restored at the timetable change in 2007 between Emmerich and Wesel in order to compensate for the thinning of RB 35 (''Der Weseler'') services on the Emmerich\u2013Wesel\u2013Duisburg route as a result of reduced funds for regional transport. In order to reach Emmerich in time for the return journey, it was necessary reduce stops at some minor stations to two-hour intervals in the direction of least loading.\n\nThe problematic section between Emmerich and Wesel was transferred with effect from December 2016 with the letting of the contract for the new ''Rhine-IJssel-Express'' (RE 19), since the Rhein-Express now only operates on the Wesel\u2013Koblenz section.\n\nThe ''Rhein-Express'' was operated by [[DB Regio NRW]] from 1998 to June 2019, based at the depot at Cologne-Deutz. [[National Express]] has operated the service as the RE&nbsp;5 (RRX) since June 2019\n\n==Lines ==\nThe ''Rhein-Express'' uses four different lines with eight different route numbers:\n\n*the [[Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway]] between Wesel (formerly Emmerich) and Oberhausen (used by regional, long-distance and freight trains),\n*the [[Duisburg\u2013Dortmund railway]] between Oberhausen and Duisburg (all traffic without stops)\n*the [[Cologne\u2013Duisburg railway]] throughout (long distance tracks, see note below)\n*the [[Left Rhine line]] between Cologne and Koblenz (together with regional and intercity services).\n\nIn the four to six track section between Duisburg and D\u00fcsseldorf, the Rhein-Express and the [[NRW-Express]] (RE 1), use the long-distance tracks.
