The attack and subsequent hardships were instrumental in hardening Drake's attitude against Spain and Catholicism. Earlier in his life, he and his family had been forced to live in poverty after they were displaced by a Catholic rebellion in England.\n\n==Post-Spanish era==\n{{See also|Bombardment of San Juan de Ul\u00faa}}\n\nAfter [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico's independence]] in 1821, a large number of Spanish troops continued to occupy San Juan de Ul\u00faa as late as 1825. It was the last site in the former New Spain to be held by Spain and was surrendered to General [[Miguel Barrag\u00e1n]] in November 1825. The Spanish forces were expelled by President [[Vicente Guerrero]] after the failed attempt at re-conquering the country.\n\nSince then, San Juan de Ul\u00faa served as a military and political symbol of Mexican resistance to foreign invasions and occupations, several of which took place during the nineteenth century. In 1836 the French invaded and occupied to put pressure on the national government; during the Mexican\u2013American War, in 1847-48 the U.S. occupied the fort and Veracruz, and in 1863 the French briefly occupied the city when installing Maximilian I as emperor. For much of the nineteenth century, the fort served as a [[prison]], especially for [[political prisoner]]s judged to be opposition to the government. Many prominent Mexican politicians spent time here while they were not in power.\n\nFinally in 1914, the last U.S. invasion, attack and occupation of the port of Veracruz took place as part of the [[Tampico Affair]], against the background of the Mexican Revolution which threatened the regional oil industry, in which Americans were heavily invested. The national legislature awarded the port and city of Veracruz the title of ''Heroic'' for the fourth time following this incident.\n\nA portion of San Juan de Ul\u00faa also served several times as the [[presidential palace]], housing presidents such as [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. The citadel was also used as a prison, especially during the early 20th-century regime of President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]. It is popularly said that in order to prevent prisoners from escaping, [[sharks]] were put into the waters surrounding the island, so that they would kill anyone attempting to escape.\n\n==Modern times==\nThe fortress complex was ultimately closed when it was no longer needed for sea defense. After several years of decay, renovations were begun on the complex in the late 20th century. Some projects are continuing.\n\nSan Juan de Ul\u00faa has been preserved and adapted as a museum. The prisons and the fortresses are all open to the public, with the exception of the former presidential palace, which suffered severe decay and is still undergoing renovations. The complex is a very popular tourist attraction.\n\nSan Juan de Ul\u00faa was used to depict the fortress in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], in the climax of the 1984 film ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[San Carlos Fortress]]\n*[[Military of New Spain]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|San Juan de Ulua Fort, Veracruz}}\n*[http://www.sanjuandeulua.com.mx Official San Juan de Ulua website]\n\n{{coord|19|12|33|N|96|07|53|W|region:MX_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}{{Castles in Mexico}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:San Juan De Ulua}}\n[[Category:Forts in Mexico]]\n[[Category:History museums in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Museums in Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Prison museums in North America]]\n[[Category:Defunct prisons in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Veracruz (city)]]\n[[Category:Gulf Coast of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Military history of Mexico]]\n[[Category:1565 establishments in New Spain]]\n[[Category:1560s establishments in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Castles in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Spanish colonial fortifications in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1769]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:San juan ulua1.JPG|thumb|San Juan de Ul\u00faa]]\n[[File:Plan du fort de Saint Jean d'Ulloa et vue panoramique 1838.jpg|thumb|Plan and panoramic view of the fort in 1838 from French map during the war between France and Mexico]]\n\n'''San Juan de Ul\u00faa''', also known as '''Castle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa''', is a large complex of [[fortresses]], prisons and one former palace on an island of the same name in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] overlooking the [[seaport]] of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], Mexico.
