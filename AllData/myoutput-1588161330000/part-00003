Best known for his orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]'', he composed many other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]] being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the [[English folk music#Folk revivals 1890\u20131969|English folksong revival]] of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as [[Maurice Ravel]], led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.\n\n\n\nFat humongous fart erupted in the houses of australia\nThere were professional musicians in the previous three generations of Holst's family and it was clear from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist but was prevented by [[neuritis]] in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] under [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the [[trombone]] professionally and later became a teacher\u2014a great one, according to his colleague [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. Among other teaching activities, he built up a strong tradition of performance at [[Morley College]], where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924 and pioneered music education for women at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of [[Whitsun]] music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.\n\nHolst's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of ''The Planets'' in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years, his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a considerable influence on a number of younger English composers, including [[Edmund Rubbra]], [[Michael Tippett]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. Apart from ''The Planets'' and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years===\n====Family background====\n[[File:Holst-family-tree.tif|thumb|upright=1.4|right|alt=family tree diagram showing Gustav in relation to three earlier generations|Holst family tree (simplified)]]\nHolst was born in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], the elder of the two children of Adolph von Holst, a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, ''n\u00e9e'' Lediard.

He persevered, and gradually built up a class of dedicated music-lovers.<ref>Holst (1969), p. 30</ref>\n\nAccording to the composer [[Edmund Rubbra]], who studied under him in the early 1920s, Holst was \"a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of [[Ebenezer Prout|Prout]] and [[John Stainer|Stainer]], but with a miniature score of ''[[Petrushka]]'' or the then recently published [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] of Vaughan Williams\".<ref>Rubbra, p. 40</ref> He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. \"I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest\u2014if I agreed!\u2014that, given such and such a phrase, the following one would be better if it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon&nbsp;...

A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite ''A Somerset Rhapsody'' (1906\u201307), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four.<ref name=D192>Dickinson (1995), p. 192</ref> Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's ''Norfolk Rhapsody'', Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \"rises beyond the level of&nbsp;... a song-selection\".<ref>Dickinson (1995), pp. 110\u2013111</ref> Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \"transformed his orchestral writing\", and that the composition of ''A Somerset Rhapsody'' did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions.<ref name=H661/> In the ''Two Songs without Words'' of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom.<ref>Short, p. 65</ref> An orchestral folksong fantasy ''Songs of the West'', also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by [[James Curnow]].<ref>Dickinson (1995), pp. 192\u2013193</ref>\n{{listen|type=music\n|filename=Holst First Suite March.ogg\n|title=March from Holst's First Suite in E-flat for Military Band\n|description=Performed by the U.S. Marine Band}}\nIn the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the ''[[Beni Mora]]'' suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of [[Minimal music|minimalism]] in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in [[First Suite in E-flat for Military Band|E flat (1909)]] and [[Second Suite in F for Military Band|F major (1911)]] respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple.<ref name=grove/> This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\".<ref>Short, p. 82</ref> Also in 1911 he wrote ''Hecuba's Lament'', a setting of [[Gilbert Murray]]'s translation from [[Euripides]] built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent [[Hecuba]]'s defiance of divine wrath.<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 22</ref> In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which he experimented with [[plainsong]];<ref name=H662>Holst (1980), p. 662</ref> the same year saw the enduringly popular ''St Paul's Suite'' (a \"gay but retrogressive\" piece according to Dickinson),<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 167</ref> and the failure of his large scale orchestral work ''Phantastes''.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===Full flowering===\n====''The Planets''====\n[[File:Holst-Planets-Saturn-score.jpg|thumb|The opening of \"Saturn\", the fifth movement of ''The Planets'']]\nHolst conceived the idea of ''[[The Planets]]'' in 1913, partly as a result of his interest in astrology,{{refn|Holst was reading [[Alan Leo]]'s booklet ''What is a Horoscope?'' at the time.<ref>Short, p. 122</ref>|group=n}} and also from his determination, despite the failure of ''Phantastes'', to produce a large-scale orchestral work.<ref name=dnb/> The chosen format may have been influenced by Schoenberg's [[Five Pieces for Orchestra|''F\u00fcnf Orchesterst\u00fccke'']], and shares something of the aesthetic, Matthews suggests, of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' or ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]''.<ref name=grove/><ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 169</ref> Holst began composing ''The Planets'' in 1914;

''A Choral Fantasia'' of 1930 was written for the [[Three Choirs Festival]] at [[Gloucester]]; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, \"knows something of the 'colossal and mysterious' loneliness of ''Egdon Heath''\".<ref>Holst (1986), pp. 100\u2013101</ref> Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst's remaining works were for small forces; the eight ''Canons'' of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen's view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers.

Best known for his orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]'', he composed many other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]] being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the [[English folk music#Folk revivals 1890\u20131969|English folksong revival]] of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as [[Maurice Ravel]], led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.\n\nThere were professional musicians in the previous three generations of Holst's family and it was clear from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist but was prevented by [[neuritis]] in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] under [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the [[trombone]] professionally and later became a teacher\u2014a great one, according to his colleague [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. Among other teaching activities, he built up a strong tradition of performance at [[Morley College]], where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924 and pioneered music education for women at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of [[Whitsun]] music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.\n\nHolst's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of ''The Planets'' in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years, his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a considerable influence on a number of younger English composers, including [[Edmund Rubbra]], [[Michael Tippett]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. Apart from ''The Planets'' and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years===\n====Family background====\n[[File:Holst-family-tree.tif|thumb|upright=1.4|right|alt=family tree diagram showing Gustav in relation to three earlier generations|Holst family tree (simplified)]]\nHolst was born in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], the elder of the two children of Adolph von Holst, a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, ''n\u00e9e'' Lediard.

He also taught at the [[Mary Ward Centre|Passmore Edwards Settlement]], where among other innovations he gave the British premieres of two Bach cantatas.<ref>Holst (1981), p. 30</ref> The two teaching posts for which he is probably best known were director of music at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], [[Hammersmith]], from 1905 until his death, and director of music at [[Morley College]] from 1907 to 1924.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nVaughan Williams wrote of the former establishment: \"Here he did away with the childish sentimentality which schoolgirls were supposed to appreciate and substituted Bach and [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|da Vittoria]]; a splendid background for immature minds.\"<ref name=archive/> Several of Holst's pupils at St Paul's went on to distinguished careers, including the soprano [[Joan Cross]],<ref>Gibbs, pp. 161\u201362</ref> and the oboist and [[cor anglais]] player Helen Gaskell.<ref>Gibbs, p. 168</ref>\n\nOf Holst's impact on Morley College, Vaughan Williams wrote: \"[A] bad tradition had to be broken down. The results were at first discouraging, but soon a new spirit appeared and the music of Morley College, together with its offshoot the 'Whitsuntide festival'&nbsp;... became a force to be reckoned with\".<ref name=archive/> Before Holst's appointment, Morley College had not treated music very seriously (Vaughan Williams's \"bad tradition\"), and at first Holst's exacting demands drove many students away. He persevered, and gradually built up a class of dedicated music-lovers.<ref>Holst (1969), p. 30</ref>\n\nAccording to the composer [[Edmund Rubbra]], who studied under him in the early 1920s, Holst was \"a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of [[Ebenezer Prout|Prout]] and [[John Stainer|Stainer]], but with a miniature score of ''[[Petrushka]]'' or the then recently published [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] of Vaughan Williams\".<ref>Rubbra, p. 40</ref> He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. \"I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest\u2014if I agreed!\u2014that, given such and such a phrase, the following one would be better if it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon&nbsp;...

He set poetry by [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[Robert Bridges]] and, a particular influence, [[Walt Whitman]], whose words he set in \"Dirge for Two Veterans\" and ''The Mystic Trumpeter'' (1904). He wrote an orchestral ''Walt Whitman Overture'' in 1899.<ref name=grove/> While on tour with the Carl Rosa company Holst had read some of [[Max M\u00fcller]]'s books, which inspired in him a keen interest in [[Sanskrit]] texts, particularly the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]] hymns.<ref name=r30/> He found the existing English versions of the texts unconvincing,{{refn|Holst considered them either \"misleading translations in colloquial English\" or else \"strings of English words with no meanings to an English mind.\"<ref name=h24>Holst (1981), p. 24</ref>|group=n}} and decided to make his own translations, despite his lack of skills as a linguist. He enrolled in 1909 at [[University College London|University College, London]], to study the language.<ref name=h24/>\n\nImogen commented on his translations: \"He was not a poet, and there are occasions when his verses seem na\u00efve. But they never sound vague or slovenly, for he had set himself the task of finding words that would be 'clear and dignified' and that would 'lead the listener into another world'\".<ref name=h198125>Holst (1981), p. 25</ref> His settings of translations of Sanskrit texts included ''Sita'' (1899\u20131906), a three-act opera based on an episode in the ''[[Ramayana]]'' (which he eventually entered for a competition for English opera set by the Milan music publisher [[Casa Ricordi|Tito Ricordi]]);<ref>Short, p. 55</ref> ''[[Savitri (opera)|Savitri]]'' (1908), a [[chamber opera]] based on a tale from the ''[[Mahabharata]]''; four groups of ''Hymns from the Rig Veda'' (1908\u201314); and two texts originally by [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa]]: ''Two Eastern Pictures'' (1909\u201310) and ''The Cloud Messenger'' (1913).<ref name=grove/>\n\nTowards the end of the nineteenth century, British musical circles had experienced a new interest in national folk music. Some composers, such as Sullivan and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], remained indifferent,<ref>Hughes, p. 159 (Sullivan); and Kennedy, p. 10 (Elgar)</ref> but Parry, Stanford, Stainer and [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] were founding members of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society|Folk-Song Society]].<ref name=graebe/> Parry considered that by recovering English folk song, English composers would find an authentic national voice; he commented, \"in true folk-songs there is no sham, no got-up glitter, and no vulgarity\".<ref name=graebe/> Vaughan Williams was an early and enthusiastic convert to this cause, going round the English countryside collecting and noting down folk songs. These had an influence on Holst. Though not as passionate on the subject as his friend, he incorporated a number of folk melodies in his own compositions and made several arrangements of folk songs collected by others.<ref name=graebe>{{cite journal|last=Graebe|first=Martin|title=Gustav Holst, Songs of the West, and the English Folk Song Movement|journal=Folk Music Journal|year=2011|volume=10|issue=1|pages=5\u201341|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/884536926}} {{subscription}}</ref> The ''Somerset Rhapsody'' (1906\u201307), was written at the suggestion of the folk-song collector [[Cecil Sharp]] and made use of tunes that Sharp had noted down.

There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time.<ref>Holst (1981), pp. 30\u201331</ref> A concert performance of the work was given at [[The Old Vic]], preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams.

He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from [[H. Balfour Gardiner]] to join him and the brothers [[Clifford Bax|Clifford]] and [[Arnold Bax]] in Spain.<ref>Mitchell, p. 118</ref> During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to [[astrology]], an interest that later inspired his suite ''[[The Planets]]''.

During that festival, Noel, a staunch supporter of Russia's [[October Revolution]], demanded in a Saturday message during the service that there should be a greater political commitment from those who participated in the church activities; his claim that several of Holst's pupils (implicitly those from St Paul's Girls' School) were merely \"camp followers\" caused offence.<ref>Short, p. 158; and Mitchell, pp. 154\u201355</ref> Holst, anxious to protect his students from being embroiled in ecclesiastical conflict, moved the Whitsun Festival to Dulwich, though he himself continued to help with the Thaxted choir and to play the church organ on occasion.<ref>Mitchell, p. 156</ref>\n\n===First World War===\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Holst tried to enlist but was rejected as unfit for military service.<ref name=dnb/> He felt frustrated that he could not contribute to the war effort.

Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the ''[[Beni Mora]]'' suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of [[Minimal music|minimalism]] in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in [[First Suite in E-flat for Military Band|E flat (1909)]] and [[Second Suite in F for Military Band|F major (1911)]] respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple.<ref name=grove/> This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\".<ref>Short, p. 82</ref> Also in 1911 he wrote ''Hecuba's Lament'', a setting of [[Gilbert Murray]]'s translation from [[Euripides]] built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent [[Hecuba]]'s defiance of divine wrath.<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 22</ref> In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which he experimented with [[plainsong]];<ref name=H662>Holst (1980), p. 662</ref> the same year saw the enduringly popular ''St Paul's Suite'' (a \"gay but retrogressive\" piece according to Dickinson),<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 167</ref> and the failure of his large scale orchestral work ''Phantastes''.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===Full flowering===\n====''The Planets''====\n[[File:Holst-Planets-Saturn-score.jpg|thumb|The opening of \"Saturn\", the fifth movement of ''The Planets'']]\nHolst conceived the idea of ''[[The Planets]]'' in 1913, partly as a result of his interest in astrology,{{refn|Holst was reading [[Alan Leo]]'s booklet ''What is a Horoscope?'' at the time.<ref>Short, p. 122</ref>|group=n}} and also from his determination, despite the failure of ''Phantastes'', to produce a large-scale orchestral work.<ref name=dnb/> The chosen format may have been influenced by Schoenberg's [[Five Pieces for Orchestra|''F\u00fcnf Orchesterst\u00fccke'']], and shares something of the aesthetic, Matthews suggests, of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' or ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]''.<ref name=grove/><ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 169</ref> Holst began composing ''The Planets'' in 1914;

While written within the traditions of north-country brass-band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unmistakable imprint, \"from the skipping [[Time signature#Most frequent time signatures|6/8]] of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of ''Saturn''\".<ref>Short, p. 263</ref> 'A Moorside Suite' has undergone major revisionism in the article 'Symphony Within: rehearing Holst's 'A Moorside Suite' by Stephen Arthur Allen in the Winter 2017 edition of 'The Musical Times'.<ref>Stephen Arthur Allen, 'Symphony within: rehearing Holst's \"A Moorside Suite\"', The Musical Times (Winter, 2017), pp.7\u201332</ref> As with 'Egdon Heath' \u2013 commissioned as a symphony \u2013 the article reveals the symphonic nature of this brass-band work.\n\nAfter this, Holst tackled his final attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with ''The Wandering Scholar'' (1929\u201330), to a text by Clifford Bax. Imogen refers to the music as \"Holst at his best in a scherzando (playful) frame of mind\";<ref name=H664/> Vaughan Williams commented on the lively, folksy rhythms: \"Do you think there's a ''little'' bit too much 6/8 in the opera?\"<ref>Quoted in Short, p. 351</ref> Short observes that the opening motif makes several reappearances without being identified with a particular character, but imposes musical unity on the work.<ref>Short, p. 420</ref>\n\nHolst composed few large-scale works in his final years. ''A Choral Fantasia'' of 1930 was written for the [[Three Choirs Festival]] at [[Gloucester]]; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, \"knows something of the 'colossal and mysterious' loneliness of ''Egdon Heath''\".<ref>Holst (1986), pp. 100\u2013101</ref> Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst's remaining works were for small forces; the eight ''Canons'' of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen's view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers. The ''Brook Green Suite'' (1932), written for the orchestra of St Paul's School, was a late companion piece to the ''St Paul's Suite''.<ref name=H663/> The ''Lyric Movement'' for viola and small orchestra (1933) was written for [[Lionel Tertis]]. Quiet and contemplative, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was slow to gain popularity among violists.<ref>Short, pp. 324\u2013325</ref> Robin Hull, in ''Penguin Music Magazine'', praised the work's \"clear beauty\u2014impossible to mistake for the art of any other composer\"; in Dickinson's view, however, it remains \"a frail creation\".<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 154</ref> Holst's final composition, the orchestral scherzo movement of a projected symphony, contains features characteristic of much of Holst's earlier music\u2014\"a summing up of Holst's orchestral art\", according to Short.<ref>Short, pp. 319\u2013320</ref> Dickinson suggests that the somewhat casual collection of material in the work gives little indication of the symphony that might have been written.<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 157</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\nHolst made some recordings, conducting his own music. For the [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] company he recorded ''Beni Mora'', the ''Marching Song'' and the complete ''Planets'' with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) in 1922, using the [[Recording studio#1890s to 1930s|acoustic process]]. The limitations of early recording prevented the gradual fade-out of women's voices at the end of \"Neptune\", and the lower strings had to be replaced by a tuba to obtain an effective bass sound.<ref>Short, p. 205</ref> With an anonymous string orchestra Holst recorded the ''St Paul's Suite'' and ''Country Song'' in 1925.<ref>{{cite news|title= Columbia Records|newspaper=The Times|date=5 November 1925|page=10}}</ref> Columbia's main rival, [[the Gramophone Company|HMV]], issued recordings of some of the same repertoire, with an unnamed orchestra conducted by [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Gramophone Notes |newspaper=The Times|date=9 June 1928|page=12}}</ref> When electrical recording came in, with dramatically improved recording quality, Holst and the LSO re-recorded ''The Planets'' for Columbia in 1926.<ref>Short, p. 247</ref>\n\nIn the early [[Long playing record|LP]] era little of Holst's music was available on disc.

By the early years of the 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc.

In it he found \"a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language\".<ref name=dnb/> Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as \"the greatest influence on my music\",<ref name=Short336>Short, pp. 336\u201338</ref> although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally.<ref name=grove/> Among later composers, [[Michael Tippett]] is acknowledged by Short as Holst's \"most significant artistic successor\", both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there.<ref name=Short336/> Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: \"Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision\".<ref>Tippett, p. 15</ref> Kennedy observes that \"a new generation of listeners&nbsp;... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett\".<ref name=\"OCM\"/> Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: \"With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone\".<ref name=H664/>\n\nShort cites other English composers who are in debt to Holst, in particular William Walton and [[Benjamin Britten]], and suggests that Holst's influence may have been felt further afield.{{refn|Short observes that the rising fourths of \"Jupiter\" can be heard in [[Aaron Copland|Copland]]'s ''Appalachian Spring'', and suggests that the ''Hymn of Jesus'' might be considered as a forerunner of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' \"and the hieratic serial cantatas\", though admitting that \"it is doubtful whether Stravinsky was familiar with, or even aware of this work\".<ref>Short, p. 337</ref> |group=n}} Above all, Short recognises Holst as a composer for the people, who believed it was a composer's duty to provide music for practical purposes\u2014festivals, celebrations, ceremonies, Christmas carols or simple hymn tunes. Thus, says Short, \"many people who may never have heard any of [Holst's] major works&nbsp;... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol '[[In the Bleak Midwinter]]'\".<ref>Short, p. 339</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 2009, after a weekend of concerts at Chichester Cathedral in memory of Holst, a new memorial was unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the composer's death.
