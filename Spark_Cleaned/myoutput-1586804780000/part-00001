Lee]]. The film also features an [[ensemble cast]] featuring: [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Nicole Ari Parker]], [[Margaret Avery]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Mike Epps]], [[Mo'Nique]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Louis C.K.]], and [[James Earl Jones]].\n\n==Plot==\nDr. R.J. \u201cRoscoe\u201d Stevens ([[Martin Lawrence]]) is a successful talk-show host, having discarded his awkward Southern roots, and is engaged to ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' winner Bianca Kittles ([[Joy Bryant]]).\n\nBringing Bianca and his 10-year-old son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) to his sleepy Southern hometown for his parents 50th wedding anniversary, R.J. is determined to prove he is no longer the walking disaster his family used to pick on. In Georgia, he is met by his pick-pocketing cousin Reggie ([[Mike Epps]]), and arrives at the family home to greet his parents, Roscoe Sr. ([[James Earl Jones]]) and Mama Jenkins ([[Margaret Avery]]); his brother Otis ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), the town sheriff; Otis' wife Ruthie ([[Liz Mikel]]) and their overgrown kids, Junior (Brandin Jenkins) and Callie (Krystal Marea Braud); and Roscoe's rowdy sister Betty ([[Mo'Nique]]). Roscoe's cousin Clyde ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) drops in, reigniting their past competitiveness, and escorting Lucinda ([[Nicole Ari Parker]]), Roscoe\u2019s past love interest.\n\nRoscoe endures much self-humiliation: he accidentally hits his mother in the head with a softball, is beaten up by Otis and Betty after insulting them, faces constant blackmail by Reggie, and is sprayed by a [[skunk]] while sleeping. It becomes obvious that he still holds a grudge against his father for showing Clyde preferential treatment when they were younger, while Roscoe Sr. resents his son for changing his name and distancing himself from his family. Bianca does not fit in well with the Jenkins, and Roscoe and Lucinda get reacquainted.\n\nOn the Jenkins' anniversary, the whole family gathers for their traditional obstacle course. Roscoe and Clyde aggressively make their way through, hurting themselves and others. When Roscoe begins to help his son over an obstacle, Bianca tells him to leave Jamaal and he does, to his parents' shock. Roscoe and Clyde race to the finish line, and Roscoe wins. As Bianca cheers, Roscoe berates his family, reminding them that it is all about \"the team of me\".\n\nThe family is angry, Jamaal refuses to go near his father, and Roscoe Sr. reprimands his son for his behavior. Unable to contain his resentment, Roscoe lashes out at his father, saying that although Clyde's father died, Roscoe felt he lost his own father because he always favored Clyde, and chastises him for crediting Clyde\u2019s accomplishments while never acknowledging any of Roscoe\u2019s success. Stunned, Roscoe Sr. realizes he is the reason his son left home and walks off feeling guilty. Now seeing why Roscoe resented him, Clyde tells Roscoe he never tried to take his place, but only wanted to be accepted by the family and sees Roscoe as his brother. He tries to shake Roscoe's hand, but Bianca rebuffs him, and Roscoe leaves with Bianca and Jamaal, but not before his mother reminds him that his family still loves him.\n\nDriving to the airport, Bianca proposes not inviting the family to their wedding. Roscoe seems to agree, upsetting Jamaal, who proudly declares himself a Jenkins. Bianca continues to insult the Jenkins clan and Roscoe pretends to agree with her, but dumps her and her bags at the airport. Roscoe and Jamaal return to the family home with Bianca's Pomeranian Fifi, who had pursued a relationship with the Jenkins\u2019 over-aged dog Bucky.\n\nDuring the anniversary celebration, Clyde cries during his speech for Mama and Papa Jenkins, admitting how much he cares about Roscoe, who appears, apologizing to his family and congratulating his parents. He and his father make amends, and Roscoe asks Lucinda to dance. After the celebration, the family watches video of the celebration on a big-screen TV while Roscoe and Lucinda depart to make love, discovering when they enter the bedroom that the dogs Bucky and Fifi had intercourse, too. During the credits, Roscoe interviews his family on his show, renamed ''The Roscoe Jenkins Show''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Dr. RJ Stevens/Roscoe Steven Jenkins, Jr.: a famous talk show host. The main [[protagonist]] of the film.\n* [[Joy Bryant]] as Bianca Kittles: a former ''Survivor'' contestant and R.J.'s fiance.
