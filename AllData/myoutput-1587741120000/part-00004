However, he is waitlisted. He lives with his wealthy adopted family, led by the matriarch Georgina. His opponent in the race is River Barclay, a popular student and friend of Payton's with whom he'd previously had a relationship. Though he knows he can pay the right price to be able to force the majority of his classmates to vote for him. He is also homosexual, a fact he is desperately trying to hide in the fear that he won't be accepted by his classmates and family. Payton is advised by his friends McAfee, James, and his girlfriend Alice. When Payton learns that River has Skye Leighton, a gender-nonconforming black classmate, to be his running mate, Payton confronts him, who informs him that he only did so on his girlfriend Astrid Sloan's direction, apologises to Payton, telling him that he loves him, and commits suicide in front of Payton. Following River's death, Astrid takes his spot on the ticket, retaining Skye as her running-mate. In order to combat the sympathy Astrid gains, Alice and Payton agree to a public breakup to gain sympathy for him. Payton later chooses Infinity Jackson, a student suffering from cancer, as his running-mate, but is told by a student named Andrew that she is faking it. \n |LineColor       = E97D9F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = The Harrington Commode\n |DirectedBy      = Brad Falchuk\n |WrittenBy       = Ryan Murphy & Brad Falchuk & Ian Brennan\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|27}}\n |ProdCode        = 1BAC02\n |ShortSummary    = Georgina tells Keaton, Payton's adopted father, that she's in love with a woman and wants a divorce, leading Keaton to attempt suicide; he survives, and is put into a medically-induced coma.

James, however, shows loyalty by tricking Astrid and Skye, making themselves look bad at a campaign event. Meanwhile, Infinity's boyfriend Ricardo gives Astrid a tape to make Payton look bad.

Meanwhile, McAfee, having graduated with a political science degree from Columbia, begins interning for state senate leader Dede Standish. Due to Standish not having an opponent for years, the campaign is not up with the times. McAfee contacts James, and the pair pitch a possible run to Payton, since he can capitalize off of the poor state of the MTA. Payton is initially reluctant. He visits Alice before her wedding to another man, and later speaks to River's ghost, who convinces him to run. Payton returns to his dorm, where he is met by James, McAfee, and Skye, as well as Alice, who ran away from the altar, and Astrid, who has been working as a server. Astrid reveals that, while catering an event, she discovered that Standish is in a three-way-marriage, a scandal that Payton can use to his advantage.

His opponent in the race is River Barclay, a popular student and friend of Payton's with whom he'd previously had a relationship. Though he knows he can pay the right price to be able to force the majority of his classmates to vote for him. He is also homosexual, a fact he is desperately trying to hide in the fear that he won't be accepted by his classmates and family. Payton is advised by his friends McAfee, James, and his girlfriend Alice. When Payton learns that River has Skye Leighton, a gender-nonconforming black classmate, to be his running mate, Payton confronts him, who informs him that he only did so on his girlfriend Astrid Sloan's direction, apologises to Payton, telling him that he loves him, and commits suicide in front of Payton. Following River's death, Astrid takes his spot on the ticket, retaining Skye as her running-mate. In order to combat the sympathy Astrid gains, Alice and Payton agree to a public breakup to gain sympathy for him.

Meanwhile, McAfee, having graduated with a political science degree from Columbia, begins interning for state senate leader Dede Standish. Due to Standish not having an opponent for years, the campaign is not up with the times. McAfee contacts James, and the pair pitch a possible run to Payton, since he can capitalize off of the poor state of the MTA. Payton is initially reluctant. He visits Alice before her wedding to another man, and later speaks to River's ghost, who convinces him to run. Payton returns to his dorm, where he is met by James, McAfee, and Skye, as well as Alice, who ran away from the altar, and Astrid, who has been working as a server. Astrid reveals that, while catering an event, she discovered that Standish is in a three-way-marriage, a scandal that Payton can use to his advantage. With his team by his side, Payton declares his run for state senate, though all are unaware that Standish is secretly planning on running for Vice President of the United States.\n |LineColor       = E97D9F\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn February 5, 2018, it was announced that [[Netflix]] had given the production a two-season straight-to-series order.
