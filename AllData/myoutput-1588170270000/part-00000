Lindsay was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.

A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford and Bishop [[James Kennedy (bishop)|James Kennedy]] of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop's lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.<ref name=\"lindsays\">Jervise, A.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.
