Part of this disagreement resulted from a long tradition of competition between the four main oceanographic institutions: [[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory|Lamont Geological Observatory]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in [[Massachusetts]], the [[University of Miami]] in Florida, and the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in California.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> The competitive nature of these institutions meant that they often refused to cooperate. The East Coast institutions favoured a drilling site in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or [[Caribbean]], while Scripps in [[San Diego]] favoured a [[North Pacific]] site.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> Any site had to be near a large port to make the logistics of the large expedition feasible, it had to have a Moho as shallow as possible, it could not be in a geologically active region, and it had to have stable weather conditions.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> In January 1965 a site north of [[Maui, Hawaii]], was selected.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/>\n\nA critical dispute was whether Mohole should begin at a modest, conservative pace with a program of drilling shallow bore holes in sediments, or whether it should proceed at once to drill the deep hole to the Moho.<ref name=\"Winterer\"/> The issue was critical since the two approaches required differing engineering, management, and allocation of resources. There was significant interest in a program of shallower holes from those in the [[oceanography|oceanographic community]] and the [[oil industry]]. The deeper hole addressed more fundamental questions about the structure of the Earth. Some viewed the more modest initial approach as developing essential engineering and drilling techniques that would later be required for the deep bore hole.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/>\n\nSome in the [[geology]] and [[geophysics]] communities objected to Mohole because, for its enormous cost, they expected that not much would be learned from drilling. They viewed the project as an engineering stunt of little scientific value.<ref name=\"G.Lill\"/>\n\n=== Management ===\nDuring the CUSS I test and shortly thereafter, the Mohole project was managed by the National Academy of Sciences, with AMSOC acting as an advisor. The informal AMSOC group was insufficient to manage what was expected to be a large project in its next phase, and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) took over management of the project in late 1961.<ref name=\"Greenberg 2\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 17, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (II) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3603 |pages=223\u2013227| doi=10.1126/science.143.3603.223|pmid=17753144 |bibcode=1964Sci...143..223G }}</ref><ref name=\"Greenberg 3\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 24, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (III) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3604 |pages=334\u2013337| doi=10.1126/science.143.3604.334|bibcode=1964Sci...143..334G }}</ref> AMSOC was retained as an advisor to NSF.

Part of this disagreement resulted from a long tradition of competition between the four main oceanographic institutions: [[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory|Lamont Geological Observatory]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in [[Massachusetts]], the [[University of Miami]] in Florida, and the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in California.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> The competitive nature of these institutions meant that they often refused to cooperate. The East Coast institutions favoured a drilling site in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or [[Caribbean]], while Scripps in [[San Diego]] favoured a [[North Pacific]] site.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> Any site had to be near a large port to make the logistics of the large expedition feasible, it had to have a Moho as shallow as possible, it could not be in a geologically active region, and it had to have stable weather conditions.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/> In January 1965 a site north of [[Maui, Hawaii]], was selected.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/>\n\nA critical dispute was whether Mohole should begin at a modest, conservative pace with a program of drilling shallow bore holes in sediments, or whether it should proceed at once to drill the deep hole to the Moho.<ref name=\"Winterer\"/> The issue was critical since the two approaches required differing engineering, management, and allocation of resources. There was significant interest in a program of shallower holes from those in the [[oceanography|oceanographic community]] and the [[oil industry]]. The deeper hole addressed more fundamental questions about the structure of the Earth. Some viewed the more modest initial approach as developing essential engineering and drilling techniques that would later be required for the deep bore hole.<ref name=\"G.Shor\"/>\n\nSome in the [[geology]] and [[geophysics]] communities objected to Mohole because, for its enormous cost, they expected that not much would be learned from drilling. They viewed the project as an engineering stunt of little scientific value.<ref name=\"G.Lill\"/>\n\n=== Management ===\nDuring the CUSS I test and shortly thereafter, the Mohole project was managed by the National Academy of Sciences, with AMSOC acting as an advisor. The informal AMSOC group was insufficient to manage what was expected to be a large project in its next phase, and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) took over management of the project in late 1961.<ref name=\"Greenberg 2\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 17, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (II) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3603 |pages=223\u2013227| doi=10.1126/science.143.3603.223|pmid=17753144 |bibcode=1964Sci...143..223G }}</ref><ref name=\"Greenberg 3\">{{Cite journal |first1=D.S. |last1=Greenberg |date= January 24, 1964 |title=Mohole: The project that went awry (III) |journal=Science |volume=143 |issue=3604 |pages=334\u2013337| doi=10.1126/science.143.3604.334|bibcode=1964Sci...143..334G }}</ref> AMSOC was retained as an advisor to NSF.

Bascom and his associates formed a corporation, Ocean Science and Engineering, Inc., expecting that they would continue the work demonstrated in the CUSS I test. Gordon Lill resigned from AMSOC, since his employer was [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and was vying to become the prime contractor. Roger Revelle similarly resigned.\n\nNSF declined a bid from Scripps as prime contractor, leaving it with bids from Socony Mobil Oil Co., Global-Aerojet-Shell, Brown and Root, Zapata Off-shore Co, and General Electric Co.<ref name=\"Greenberg 2\"/> A review panel at NSF rated the Socony Mobil bid the best, calling it \"in a class by itself\",<ref name=\"Greenberg 2\"/><ref name=\"Affairs\">{{Cite journal |first1=Walter H. |last1=Munk |date= 1980 |title=Affairs of the sea (revised) |url=http://scilib.ucsd.edu/sio/biogr/Munk_Affairs_of_Sea.pdf |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=8 |pages=3\u201330 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.08.050180.000245}}</ref> while further review ranked Global-Aerojet-Shell first, Socony Mobil Oil second, and Brown and Root third.<ref name=\"Greenberg 2\"/> In a decision that was widely viewed as political, NSF selected the construction company [[KBR (company)|Brown and Root]] as the prime contractor for the project in February 1962.<ref name=\"Greenberg 2\"/> Brown and Root had no experience in drilling, and its home in Houston was close the congressional district of congressman [[Albert Richard Thomas|Albert Thomas]], chair of the [[House Appropriations Committee]].

In early 1963 an agreement called CORE for a Consortium for Ocean Research and Exploration was signed by Ewing (Lamont), [[Brackett Hersey]] (WHOI), and Revelle (SIO) to carry out a deep-sea sediment drilling program.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/> In September 1963 the new director of NSF [[Leland Haworth]] addressed the AMSOC Committee to state that Mohole should consist of two programs, the deep drilling under Brown and Root and a shallow drilling program.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/> Lill expressed similar advice to the leaders of the oceanographic institutions in March 1964, advising the four main institutions to combine their interests into one large drilling project.<ref name=\"G.Lill\"/><ref name=\"E.Shor\"/>The principal institutions agreed to form the Joint Oceanographic Institutions Deep Earth Sampling ([[Deep Sea Drilling Project|JOIDES]]) program in May 1964.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/> This event was the formation of the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] of the National Science Foundation.<ref name=\"G.Lill\"/>\n\nIn October 1964 NSF provided a 2-year contract to the University of Miami to begin planning JOIDES.<ref name=\"E.Shor\"/> The first drilling expedition under JOIDES was in spring 1965 to the Blake Plateau off the southeastern United States.
