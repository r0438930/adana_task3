{"title_page": "Financial analyst", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2008}}\nA '''financial analyst''' is a professional, undertaking  [[financial analysis]] for external or internal clients as a core part of the job. \nThe role may specifically  be titled '''securities analyst''', '''research analyst''', '''equity analyst''', '''investment analyst''', or '''rating analyst'''.\n\n(The term \u201cfinancial analyst\u201d is not usually taken to include [[quantitative analyst]]s, or \u201cquants\u201d; typically, these are concerned with [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[fixed income analysis]], and focus on [[mathematical modeling]] as opposed to accounting-related analytics.)\n\n==Job==\nFinancial analysts are employed by [[mutual fund|mutual-]] and [[pension fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, securities firms, banks, [[investment bank]]s, insurance companies, and other businesses, helping these companies or their clients make investment decisions. \nCorporate finance analysts (additionally) perform budget and cost modelling as part of their responsibilities;\n[[Credit analyst|credit analysis]] is likewise a distinct area.\n\nFinancial analysts invariably use [[spreadsheet]]s (and [[statistical software]] packages) to analyze financial data, spot trends, and develop forecasts; see [[Financial modeling#Accounting|Financial modeling]].  The analyst often also meets with company officials to gain a better insight into a company's prospects and to determine the company's managerial effectiveness.\n\n===Securities firms===\n{{Main|Securities research}}\nIn a stock brokerage house or investment bank, the analyst will read company financial statements and analyze commodity prices, sales, costs, expenses, and tax rates in order to [[business valuation|determine a company's value]] and [[financial forecast|project future earnings]]. On the basis of their results, they [[research report|write reports]] and make presentations, usually making recommendations to buy or sell a particular investment or security.\n\nTypically, at the end of the assessment, an analyst would provide a rating recommending or investment action: to buy, sell, or hold the security. Senior analysts may actually make the decision to buy or sell for the company or client if they are the ones responsible for managing the assets. Other, \"junior\" analysts use the data to model and measure the financial risks associated with making a particular investment decision. See [[Securities research#Career path]].\n\nUsually, financial analysts study an entire industry ([[Securities research#Analyst specialization|\"sector specialist\"]]), assessing current trends in business practices, products, and industry competition. They must keep abreast of new regulations or policies that may affect the industry, as well as monitor the economy to determine its effect on earnings.\nA 1999 paper by Ezra Zuckermann found that, as equity analysts divide securities by discrete sectors, companies which fall outside or across multiple sectors are punished in the ratings of analysts <ref>{{cite journal|jstor=10.1086/210178|title=The Categorical Imperative: Securities Analysts and the Illegitimacy Discount|first=Ezra W.|last=Zuckerman|date=18 May 1999|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=104|issue=5|pages=1398\u20131438|doi=10.1086/210178|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6b733e78175a89ca84b00ad4d4052eabc09f8237}}</ref>\n\nAnalysts are generally divided into  [[Buy-side analyst|'buy-side']] and [[Buy-side analyst|'sell-side']].   \nA buy-side analyst,  such as a fund manager, works for a company which buys and holds stocks itself, on the analyst's recommendation. \nA sell-side analyst's work is not used by its employer to invest directly, rather it is sold either for money or for other benefits by the employer to buy-side organisations. Sell-side research is often used as 'soft money' rather than sold directly, for example provided to preferred clients in return for business. [[research report|Writing reports]] or notes expressing opinions is always a part of \"sell-side\" (brokerage) analyst job and is often not required for \"buy-side\" (investment firms) analysts. \nIt is sometimes used to promote the companies being researched when the sell-side has some other interest in them, as a form of marketing, which can lead to conflicts of interest.  \nThe buy-side is sometimes considered more prestigious, professional, and scholarly, while the sell-side may be higher-paid and more like a sales and marketing role.  \nIt is common to begin careers on the sell-side at large banks then move to the buy-side at a fund.\n\nTraditionally, analysts use [[fundamental analysis]] principles but [[technical analysis]] and tactical evaluation of the market environment are also routine. Analysts obtain information by studying public records and filings by the company, as well as by participating in public [[conference calls]] where they can ask direct questions to the management. Additional information can be also received in small group or one-on-one meetings with senior members of management teams. However, in many markets such information gathering became difficult and potentially illegal due to legislative changes brought upon by corporate scandals in the early 2000s. One example is [[Regulation FD]] (Fair Disclosure) in the United States. Many other developed countries also adopted similar rules.\n\nAnalyst performance is ranked by a range of services such as StarMine owned by [[Thomson Reuters]] or Institutional Investor magazine. \nResearch by [[Numis]] found that small companies with the most analyst coverage outperformed peers by 2.5 per cent \u2014 while those with low coverage underperformed by 0.7 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/473a37a8-1720-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44|title=Subscribe to read|author=|date=|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n===Other areas===\nFinancial analysts in the [[investment banking]] departments of securities or banking firms often work in teams, analyzing the future prospects of companies that want to [[initial public offering |sell shares to the public for the first time]]; this task is often identical to that of a securities analyst. \nOn this basis, they will then make presentations to prospective investors (\u201c[[financial roadshows|roadshows]]\u201d) about the merits of investing in the new company. \nAn additional component of the IB role: analysts ensure that all forms and written materials necessary for compliance with [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] regulations are accurate and complete. \nIB analysts similarly work in [[mergers and acquisitions]] departments, preparing analyses on the costs and benefits of a proposed merger or takeover; here there are both [[buy-side analyst|buy-side-]] and [[sell-side analyst]]s.\n\n[[Corporate finance]] analysts assist in long term [[capital budgeting]] and [[Corporate finance#Investment and project valuation|\"project\" valuation]], \nand short term [[working capital management]], including tasks such as [[profitability analysis]], and [[Treasury_management#Corporate_Finance|treasury management]].\nThey are also typically involved with [[budgeting]] and planning (and corporate strategy), their models forming the basis for [[financial forecast]]ing, [[scenario analysis]] and balance-sheet optimization; their forecasts also feed into group [[Asset_and_liability_management|ALM]].\nThe latter, will often extend to involvement with [[dividend policy]], and [[capital structure]].\n\nThere are several analyst roles related to [[credit risk]], macro or micro. \n[[ratings agency|Ratings analysts]] (who are often employees of [[ratings agencies]]), evaluate the ability of companies or governments that issue bonds to repay their debt. On the basis of their evaluation, a management team [[Bond credit rating|assigns a rating]] to a company's or government's bonds. \nFinancial analysts employed in [[Commercial lender|commercial lending]]{{dn|date=December 2019}} perform \"[[balance sheet|balance sheet analysis]]\", examining the [[financial statements|audited financial statements]] and corollary data in order to assess lending risks.  \nIn [[retail banking]], [[credit analyst]]s build models to determine an applicant's creditworthyness, assign an initial [[credit score]], and monitor this and the loan on an ongoing basis. \nIn the latter two roles, [[Impairment (financial reporting)|impairment-]] and [[Provision (accounting)|provision]]-modelling are often a prominent deliverable.\n\nSome financial analysts, specialize as \"[[accounting analyst]]s\"; they will collect industry data (mainly balance sheet, income statement and capital adequacy in banking sector), merger and acquisition history and financial news for their clients. They then typically \u201cstandardize\u201c the different companies' data, facilitating  [[peer group analysis]]: the main objective here is to enable their clients to make better decisions about the investment across different regions. They also provide the abundance of [[financial ratio]]s calculated from the data gathered from financial statements, and possibly other sources.\n\n==Qualification==\nIn general, a [[Business education#Undergraduate education|Bachelor's degree]] in Accounting/Finance/Economics is a minimum requirement for an entry or junior role\n(as well as proficiency in [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] - see [[Financial modeling#Accounting]]). \nOften, more senior analysts are expected to then earn an [[MBA]], having gained 2\u20133 years experience in the junior role.  \nIncreasingly, it is preferred that, even to enter, analysts hold a [[Master of Finance|master's degree in finance]].\nFor credit related roles, an actuarial qualification, or the [[Financial risk management#Financial risk manager|FRM]] / [[professional risk manager|PRM]] is often required. \nIn corporate roles, an accounting certification - the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] or [[Chartered accountant|CA]] - is typically a prerequisite.\n\nIn securities and IB roles, it is lately preferred that, similarly, even to enter, analysts earn a master's  and / or the [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA designation]], with the MBA still common at senior levels.\nThere are also many regulatory requirements. For example, in the United States, sell-side or Wall Street research analysts must register with the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA). In addition to passing the [[General Securities Representative Exam]], candidates must pass the ''Research Analyst Examination'' ([[List of securities examinations#United States of America|series 86/87]]) in order to publish research for the purpose of selling or promoting publicly traded securities.\n\nFor sector-specialists - with approx. 5 years industry experience - less weight is placed on finance qualifications, as a relevant advanced degree or qualification in the field is often critical. (They will later be encouraged to earn the CFA / MBA.) \nFor example, [[Valuation (finance)#Valuing financial service firms|valuing financial service firms]] and  [[Valuation (finance)#Valuation of mining projects|valuing mining projects]] particularly, requires specialized knowledge re. [[Business valuation standard|valuation-]], regulatory-, and [[accounting standard]]s; and, respectively, qualifications in [[actuarial science]], and [[mining engineering]] / [[geologist|geology]] will be required.\n[[Outline of industry|Other sectors]] may similarly require advanced technical knowledge; e.g. in [[pharmacy]] / [[life sciences]] for [[:Category:Life sciences industry|\"bio-tech\"]], in [[electronic engineering]] for areas in \"[[high tech]]\". \nMost large teams will also include a CPA or CA in a dedicated technical role.  (In [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]], the CA qualification often remains sufficient to access (junior) analyst roles.)\n\n== Compensation ==\nThe job title is a broad one. As of 2012, the median pay in the United States was $76,950 per year according to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/financial-analysts.htm Financial Analysts]. BLS.</ref> SumZero found that professionals in the [[hedge fund]] industry average $409,826 per year including bonus and deferred pay.<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-people-make-at-hedge-funds-2014-4 This Is How Much The Average Person Can Make Working For A Hedge Fund]. Business Insider.</ref>\n\n==Controversies about financing==\nAnalyst recommendations on stocks owned by firms employing them may be seen as potentially biased.\n\nThe research department sometimes doesn't have the ability to bring in enough money to be a self-sustaining research company. The research analysts' department is therefore sometimes part of the [[marketing department]] of an [[investment bank]], [[brokerage]], or [[investment advisory]] firm.\n\nSince 2002 there has been extra effort to overcome perceived [[conflicts of interest]] between the investment part of the firm and the public and client research part of the firm (see [[accounting scandals]]). For example, research firms are sometimes separated into two categories, brokerage and independent. Independent researchers are not part of an investment firm and so don't have the same incentive to issue overly favorable views on companies. But this might not be sufficient to avoid all conflicts of interest. In Europe, the [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004]] and subsequent related legislation has in part been an attempt to clarify the exact remit of equity analysts.\n\nDebate still exists about the way sell-side analysts are paid. Usually brokerage fees pay for their research. But this creates a temptation for analysts to act as stock sellers and to lure investors into \"overtrading\".\n\nSome consider that it would be sounder if investors had to pay for financial research separately and directly to fully independent research firms.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Accounting analyst]]\n*[[Credit analyst]]\n*[[Financial services]]\n*[[Quantitative analyst]]\n*[[Research report]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Leon Wansleben (2012) 'Financial Analysts' In: K.
