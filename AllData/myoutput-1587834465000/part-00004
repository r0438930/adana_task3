For example, from the earliest days of English colonial schemes, new settlements beyond the seas were seen as a way to alleviate domestic social problems of criminals and [[English Poor Laws#A new colonial solution|the poor]] as well as to increase the colonial labour force,<ref name=DigitalPanopticon /> for the overall benefit of the realm.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp403-406 August 1650: An Act for the Advancing and Regulating of the Trade of this Commonwealth], Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660.

It was typically imposed for offences for which [[capital punishment|death]] was deemed too severe.

Depending on the crime, the sentence was imposed for life or for a set period of years. If imposed for a period of years, the offender was permitted to return home after serving his time, but had to make his own way back. Many offenders thus stayed in the colony as free persons, and might obtain employment as jailers or other servants of the penal colony.\n\nEngland transported its convicts and political prisoners, as well as prisoners of war from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], to [[British America|its overseas colonies in the Americas]] from the 1610s until early in the [[American Revolution]] in 1776, when transportation to America was temporarily suspended by the Criminal Law Act 1776 (16 Geo. 3 c. 43).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B09RAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA262&#v=onepage&q&f=false \"An act to authorise, for a limited time, the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\"]</ref> The practice was mandated in Scotland by an act of 1785, but was less used there than in England.

This enabled some convicts to resume a more normal life, to marry and raise a family, and to contribute to the development of the colony.\n\n===Historical background===\n====The trend towards more flexibility of sentencing====\n[[File:Convict ship Neptune00.jpg|thumb|[[Neptune (1780 ship)|The Neptune]], a 19th-century [[convict ship]] that brought prisoners to Australia]]\nIn England in the 17th and 18th centuries criminal justice was severe, later termed the [[Bloody Code]]. This was due to both the particularly large number of offences which were punishable by execution (usually by hanging), and to the limited choice of sentences available to judges for convicted criminals. With modifications to the traditional [[Benefit of clergy]], which originally exempted only clergymen from civil law, it developed into a [[legal fiction]] by which many common offenders of \"clergyable\" offenses were extended the privilege to avoid execution.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 470</ref> Many offenders were pardoned as it was considered unreasonable to execute them for relatively minor offences, but under the [[rule of law]], it was equally unreasonable for them to escape punishment entirely. With the development of colonies, transportation was introduced as an alternative punishment, although legally it was considered a condition of a pardon, rather than a sentence in itself.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 472</ref> Convicts who represented a menace to the community were sent away to distant lands. A secondary aim was to discourage crime for fear of being transported. Transportation continued to be described as a public exhibition of the king's mercy. It was a solution to a real problem in the domestic penal system.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 473</ref> There was also the hope that transported convicts could be rehabilitated and reformed by starting a new life in the colonies. In 1615, in the reign of [[James VI and I|James I]], a committee of the Council had already obtained the power to choose from the prisoners those that deserved pardon and, consequently, transportation to the colonies. Convicts were chosen carefully: the Acts of the Privy Council showed that prisoners \"for strength of bodie or other abilities shall be thought fit to be employed in foreign discoveries or other services beyond the Seas\".<ref>Acts of the Privy Council (Colonial), vol. I, pp. 310, 314-15</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], Cromwell overcame the popular prejudice against subjecting Christians to slavery or selling them into foreign parts, and initiated group transportation of military<ref>Cunningham. Growth of Eng. Industry and Com. in Mod. Times; 109, Cambridge, 1892.

Not only did his agents systematically capture Irish youths and girls for export to the West Indies, but all the garrison who were not killed in the Drogheda Massacre were shipped as slaves to the Barbadoes.\"</ref> and civilian prisoners.<ref>30 July 1649 Act empowering the Lord Mayor, Justices of Gaol delivery for Newgate, to transport threescore prisoners convicted of Felony and other heinous crimes, unto the Summer Islands or other new English Plantations.</ref> With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the penal transportation system and the number of people subjected to it, started to change inexorably between 1660 and 1720, with transportation replacing the simple discharge of clergyable felons after [[Human branding#Branding in Britain|branding the thumb]]. Alternatively, under the second act dealing with [[Moss-trooper]] brigands on the Scottish border, offenders had their benefit of clergy taken away, or otherwise at the judge's discretion, were to be transported to America, \"there to remaine and not to returne\".<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.581</ref> There were various influential agents of change: judges' discretionary powers influenced the law significantly, but the king's and Privy Council's opinions were decisive in granting a royal pardon from execution.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 471</ref>\n\nThe system changed one step at a time: in February 1663, after that first experiment, a bill was proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to allow the transporting of felons, and was followed by another bill presented to the Lords to allow the transportation of criminals convicted of felony within clergy or petty larceny. These bills failed, but it was clear that change was needed.<ref>Beattie, 1986, pp. 471\u2013472</ref> Transportation was not a sentence in itself, but could be arranged by indirect means. The reading test, crucial for the [[benefit of clergy]], was a fundamental feature of the penal system, but to prevent its abuse, this pardoning process was used more strictly. Prisoners were carefully selected for transportation based on information about their character and previous criminal record. It was arranged that they fail the reading test, but they were then reprieved and held in jail, without bail, to allow time for a royal pardon (subject to transportation) to be organised.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 475</ref>\n\n====Transportation as a commercial transaction====\n[[File:Joseph Lycett - The residence of Edward Riley Esquire, Wooloomooloo, Near Sydney N.

W.'', 1825, hand-coloured [[aquatint]] and etching printed in dark blue ink.

They obtained a contract from the sheriffs, and after the voyage to the colonies they sold the convicts as [[indentured servant]]s. The payment they received also covered the jail fees, the fees for granting the pardon, the clerk's fees, and everything necessary to authorise the transportation.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\">Beattie, 1986, p. 479</ref> These arrangements for transportation continued until the end of the 17th century and beyond, but they diminished in 1670 due to certain complications. The colonial opposition was one of the main obstacles: colonies were unwilling to collaborate in accepting prisoners: the convicts represented a danger to the colony and were unwelcome. [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] enacted laws to prohibit transportation in 1670, and the king was persuaded to respect these.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\"/>\n\nThe penal system was also influenced by economics: the profits obtained from convicts' labour boosted the economy of the colonies and, consequently, of England. Nevertheless, it could be argued that transportation was economically deleterious because the aim was to enlarge population, not diminish it;<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 480</ref> but the character of an individual convict was likely to harm the economy. [[King William's War]] (1688\u20131697) (part of the [[Nine Years' War]]) and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u201314) adversely affected merchant shipping and hence transportation. In the post-war period there was more crime<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 500</ref> and hence potentially more executions, and something needed to be done. In the reigns of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1702\u201314) and [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714\u201327), transportation was not easily arranged, but imprisonment was not considered enough to punish hardened criminals or those who had committed capital offences, so transportation was the preferred punishment.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 502\">Beattie, 1986, p. 502</ref>\n\n==== Transportation Act 1717 ====\nThere were several obstacles to the use of transportation. In 1706 the reading test for claiming benefit of clergy was abolished (5 Anne c. 6). This allowed judges to sentence \"clergyable\" offenders to a [[workhouse]] or a [[house of correction]].<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 502\"/> But the punishments that then applied were not enough of a disincentive to commit crime: another solution was needed. The [[Transportation Act 1717|Transportation Act]] was introduced into the House of Commons in 1717 under the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] government. It legitimised transportation as a direct sentence, thus simplifying the penal process.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 503\">Beattie, 1986, p. 503</ref>\n\nNon-capital convicts (clergyable [[felon]]s usually destined for branding on the thumb, and [[petty larceny]] convicts usually destined for public whipping)<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 428</ref> were directly sentenced to transportation to the American colonies for seven years. A sentence of fourteen years was imposed on prisoners guilty of capital offences pardoned by the king. Returning from the colonies before the stated period was a capital offence.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 503\"/> The bill was introduced by [[William Thompson (Ipswich MP)|William Thomson]], the [[Solicitor General]], who was \"the architect of the transportation policy\".<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 429</ref> Thomson, a supporter of the Whigs, was [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of London and became a judge in 1729. He was a prominent sentencing officer at the Old Bailey and the man who gave important information about capital offenders to the cabinet.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 426</ref>\n\nOne reason for the success of this Act was that transportation was financially costly. The system of sponsorship by merchants had to be improved. Initially the government rejected Thomson's proposal to pay merchants to transport convicts, but three months after the first transportation sentences were pronounced at the Old Bailey, his suggestion was proposed again, and the Treasury contracted [[Jonathan Forward]], a London merchant, for the transportation to the colonies.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 430</ref> The business was entrusted to Forward in 1718: he was paid \u00a33 (\u00a35 in 1727) for each prisoner transported overseas. The Treasury also paid for the transportation of prisoners from the [[Home Counties]].<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 504</ref>\n\nThe \"Felons' Act\" (as the Transportation Act was called) was printed and distributed in 1718, and in April twenty-seven men and women were sentenced to transportation.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 432</ref> The Act led to significant changes: both [[petty larceny|petty]] and [[grand larceny]] were punished by transportation (seven years), and the sentence for any non-capital offence was at the judge's discretion.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 506</ref> In 1723 an Act was presented in Virginia to discourage transportation by establishing complex rules for the reception of prisoners, but the reluctance of colonies did not stop transportation.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 505</ref>\n\nIn a few cases before 1734, the court changed sentences of transportation to sentences of branding on the thumb or whipping, by convicting the accused for lesser crimes than those of which they were accused.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 435\">Beattie, 2001, p. 435</ref><ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 439</ref> This manipulation phase came to an end in 1734. With the exception of those years, the Transportation Act led to a decrease in whipping of convicts, thus avoiding potentially inflammatory public displays. Clergyable discharge continued to be used when the accused could not be transported for reasons of age or infirmity.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 447</ref>\n\n====Women and children====\nPenal transportation was not limited to men or even to adults. Men, women, and children were sentenced to transportation, but its implementation varied by gender and age. From 1660 to 1670, highway robbery, [[burglary]], and [[horse theft]] were the offences most often punishable with transportation for men. In those years, five of the nine women who were transported after being sentenced to death were guilty of simple larceny, an offence for which [[benefit of clergy]] was not available for women until 1692.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 474</ref> Also, merchants preferred young and able-bodied men for whom there was a demand in the colonies.\n\nAll these factors meant that most women and children were simply left in jail.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\"/> Some magistrates supported a proposal to release women who could not be transported, but this solution was considered absurd: this caused the Lords Justices to order that no distinction be made between men and women.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 483</ref> Women were sent to the [[Leeward Islands]], the only colony that accepted them, and the government had to pay to send them overseas.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 482</ref> In 1696 [[Jamaica]] refused to welcome a group of prisoners because most of them were women; [[Barbados]] similarly accepted convicts but not \"women, children nor other infirm persons\".<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 481</ref>\n\nThanks to transportation, the number of men whipped and released diminished, but whipping and discharge were chosen more often for women. The reverse was true when women were sentenced for a capital offence, but actually served a lesser sentence due to a manipulation of the penal system: one advantage of this sentence was that they could be discharged thanks to benefit of clergy while men were whipped.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 444\">Beattie, 2001, p. 444</ref> Women with young children were also supported since transportation unavoidably separated them.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 444\"/> The facts and numbers revealed how transportation was less frequently applied to women and children because they were usually guilty of minor crimes and they were considered a minimal threat to the community.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 435\"/>\n\n====The end of transportation====\nThe outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) halted transportation to America. Parliament claimed that \"the transportation of convicts to his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America... is found to be attended with various inconveniences, particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community, and who, by proper care and correction, might be reclaimed from their evil course\"; they then passed \"An act to authorize... the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\"<ref name=\"BasAsylum\">Marilyn C. Baseler, [https://archive.org/details/asylumformankind00base/page/125 \"Asylum for Mankind\": America, 1607-1800], p.124-127</ref> For the ensuing decade, men were instead sentenced to hard labour and women were imprisoned. Finding alternative locations to send convicts was not easy, and the act was extended twice by the Criminal Law Act 1778 (18 Geo. 3 c. 62) and the Criminal Law Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3, c. 54).<ref>Drew D.

Both acts empowered the Crown to appoint certain places within his dominions, or outside them, as the destination for transported criminals; the acts would move convicts around the country as needed for labour, or where they could be utilized and accommodated.\n\nThe overcrowding situation and the resumption of transportation would be initially resolved by [[Orders in Council]] on 6 December 1785, by the decision to establish a penal colony in [[New South Wales]], on land previously claimed for Britain in 1770,<ref>{{cite news  | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63477180  | title = Historic Landmarks| newspaper  = [[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] | location   = Qld.  | date = 2 October 1952  | accessdate = 19 March 2017  | page = 5  | publisher  = National Library of Australia  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url  = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60569425  | title = Australian Discovery and Colonisation  | newspaper = [[Empire (newspaper)|The Empire]]  | location  = Sydney  | date = 14 April 1865  | page = 8  | publisher = National Library of Australia}}</ref> but as yet not settled by Britain or any other European power.

Although a concerted program of prison building ensued, the [[Short Titles Act 1896]] lists seven other laws relating to penal transportation in the first half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"ShTitl\">[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1896/act/14/enacted/en/print Short Titles Act 1896]</ref>\n\nThe system of criminal punishment by transportation, as it had developed over nearly 150 years, was officially ended in Britain in the 1850s, when that sentence was substituted by imprisonment with [[penal labor|penal servitude]], and intended to punish. The Penal Servitude Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 99), long titled \"An Act to substitute, in certain Cases, other Punishment in lieu of Transportation,\"<ref name=\"ShTitl\"/> enacted that with judicial discretion, lesser felonies, those subject to transportation for less than 14 years, could be sentenced to imprisonment with labour for a specific term. To provide confinement facilities, the general change in sentencing was passed in conjunction with the Convict Prisons Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 121), long titled \"An Act for providing Places of Confinement in England or Wales for Female Offenders under Sentence or Order of Transportation.\"<ref name=\"ShTitl\"/> The Penal Servitude Act 1857 (20 & 21 Vict. c. 3) ended the sentence of transportation in virtually all cases, with the terms of sentence initially being of the same duration as transportation.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1857/3/pdfs/ukpga_18570003_en.pdf Penal Servitude Act 1857]</ref><ref name=\"oldbaileyonline1\" /> While transport was greatly reduced following passage of the 1857 act, the last convicts sentenced to transportation arrived in Western Australia in 1868.

[[Norfolk Island]] was a convict penal settlement from 1788\u201394, and again from 1824\u201347. The First Fleet included boats containing food and animals from London. The ships and boats of the fleet would explore the coast of Australia by sailing all around it looking for suitable farming land and resources. In 1803, [[Tasmania|Van Diemen's Land]] (modern-day Tasmania) was also settled as a penal colony, followed by the [[Queensland|Moreton Bay Settlement]] (Queensland) in 1824. The other [[States and territories of Australia|Australian colonies]] were \"free settlements\", as non-convict colonies were known. However, the [[Swan River Colony]] (Western Australia) accepted transportation from England and Ireland in 1851, to resolve a long-standing [[Labor shortage|labour shortage]].

Depending on the crime, the sentence was imposed for life or for a set period of years.

This was due to both the particularly large number of offences which were punishable by execution (usually by hanging), and to the limited choice of sentences available to judges for convicted criminals. With modifications to the traditional [[Benefit of clergy]], which originally exempted only clergymen from civil law, it developed into a [[legal fiction]] by which many common offenders of \"clergyable\" offenses were extended the privilege to avoid execution.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 470</ref> Many offenders were pardoned as it was considered unreasonable to execute them for relatively minor offences, but under the [[rule of law]], it was equally unreasonable for them to escape punishment entirely. With the development of colonies, transportation was introduced as an alternative punishment, although legally it was considered a condition of a pardon, rather than a sentence in itself.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 472</ref> Convicts who represented a menace to the community were sent away to distant lands. A secondary aim was to discourage crime for fear of being transported. Transportation continued to be described as a public exhibition of the king's mercy. It was a solution to a real problem in the domestic penal system.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 473</ref> There was also the hope that transported convicts could be rehabilitated and reformed by starting a new life in the colonies. In 1615, in the reign of [[James VI and I|James I]], a committee of the Council had already obtained the power to choose from the prisoners those that deserved pardon and, consequently, transportation to the colonies. Convicts were chosen carefully: the Acts of the Privy Council showed that prisoners \"for strength of bodie or other abilities shall be thought fit to be employed in foreign discoveries or other services beyond the Seas\".<ref>Acts of the Privy Council (Colonial), vol.

Alternatively, under the second act dealing with [[Moss-trooper]] brigands on the Scottish border, offenders had their benefit of clergy taken away, or otherwise at the judge's discretion, were to be transported to America, \"there to remaine and not to returne\".<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.581</ref> There were various influential agents of change: judges' discretionary powers influenced the law significantly, but the king's and Privy Council's opinions were decisive in granting a royal pardon from execution.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 471</ref>\n\nThe system changed one step at a time: in February 1663, after that first experiment, a bill was proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to allow the transporting of felons, and was followed by another bill presented to the Lords to allow the transportation of criminals convicted of felony within clergy or petty larceny. These bills failed, but it was clear that change was needed.<ref>Beattie, 1986, pp. 471\u2013472</ref> Transportation was not a sentence in itself, but could be arranged by indirect means. The reading test, crucial for the [[benefit of clergy]], was a fundamental feature of the penal system, but to prevent its abuse, this pardoning process was used more strictly. Prisoners were carefully selected for transportation based on information about their character and previous criminal record. It was arranged that they fail the reading test, but they were then reprieved and held in jail, without bail, to allow time for a royal pardon (subject to transportation) to be organised.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 475</ref>\n\n====Transportation as a commercial transaction====\n[[File:Joseph Lycett - The residence of Edward Riley Esquire, Wooloomooloo, Near Sydney N.

They obtained a contract from the sheriffs, and after the voyage to the colonies they sold the convicts as [[indentured servant]]s. The payment they received also covered the jail fees, the fees for granting the pardon, the clerk's fees, and everything necessary to authorise the transportation.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\">Beattie, 1986, p. 479</ref> These arrangements for transportation continued until the end of the 17th century and beyond, but they diminished in 1670 due to certain complications. The colonial opposition was one of the main obstacles: colonies were unwilling to collaborate in accepting prisoners: the convicts represented a danger to the colony and were unwelcome. [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] enacted laws to prohibit transportation in 1670, and the king was persuaded to respect these.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\"/>\n\nThe penal system was also influenced by economics: the profits obtained from convicts' labour boosted the economy of the colonies and, consequently, of England. Nevertheless, it could be argued that transportation was economically deleterious because the aim was to enlarge population, not diminish it;<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 480</ref> but the character of an individual convict was likely to harm the economy. [[King William's War]] (1688\u20131697) (part of the [[Nine Years' War]]) and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u201314) adversely affected merchant shipping and hence transportation. In the post-war period there was more crime<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 500</ref> and hence potentially more executions, and something needed to be done. In the reigns of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1702\u201314) and [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714\u201327), transportation was not easily arranged, but imprisonment was not considered enough to punish hardened criminals or those who had committed capital offences, so transportation was the preferred punishment.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 502\">Beattie, 1986, p. 502</ref>\n\n==== Transportation Act 1717 ====\nThere were several obstacles to the use of transportation. In 1706 the reading test for claiming benefit of clergy was abolished (5 Anne c. 6). This allowed judges to sentence \"clergyable\" offenders to a [[workhouse]] or a [[house of correction]].<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 502\"/> But the punishments that then applied were not enough of a disincentive to commit crime: another solution was needed. The [[Transportation Act 1717|Transportation Act]] was introduced into the House of Commons in 1717 under the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] government. It legitimised transportation as a direct sentence, thus simplifying the penal process.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 503\">Beattie, 1986, p. 503</ref>\n\nNon-capital convicts (clergyable [[felon]]s usually destined for branding on the thumb, and [[petty larceny]] convicts usually destined for public whipping)<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 428</ref> were directly sentenced to transportation to the American colonies for seven years. A sentence of fourteen years was imposed on prisoners guilty of capital offences pardoned by the king. Returning from the colonies before the stated period was a capital offence.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 503\"/> The bill was introduced by [[William Thompson (Ipswich MP)|William Thomson]], the [[Solicitor General]], who was \"the architect of the transportation policy\".<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 429</ref> Thomson, a supporter of the Whigs, was [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of London and became a judge in 1729. He was a prominent sentencing officer at the Old Bailey and the man who gave important information about capital offenders to the cabinet.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 426</ref>\n\nOne reason for the success of this Act was that transportation was financially costly. The system of sponsorship by merchants had to be improved. Initially the government rejected Thomson's proposal to pay merchants to transport convicts, but three months after the first transportation sentences were pronounced at the Old Bailey, his suggestion was proposed again, and the Treasury contracted [[Jonathan Forward]], a London merchant, for the transportation to the colonies.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 430</ref> The business was entrusted to Forward in 1718: he was paid \u00a33 (\u00a35 in 1727) for each prisoner transported overseas. The Treasury also paid for the transportation of prisoners from the [[Home Counties]].<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 504</ref>\n\nThe \"Felons' Act\" (as the Transportation Act was called) was printed and distributed in 1718, and in April twenty-seven men and women were sentenced to transportation.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 432</ref> The Act led to significant changes: both [[petty larceny|petty]] and [[grand larceny]] were punished by transportation (seven years), and the sentence for any non-capital offence was at the judge's discretion.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 506</ref> In 1723 an Act was presented in Virginia to discourage transportation by establishing complex rules for the reception of prisoners, but the reluctance of colonies did not stop transportation.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 505</ref>\n\nIn a few cases before 1734, the court changed sentences of transportation to sentences of branding on the thumb or whipping, by convicting the accused for lesser crimes than those of which they were accused.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 435\">Beattie, 2001, p. 435</ref><ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 439</ref> This manipulation phase came to an end in 1734. With the exception of those years, the Transportation Act led to a decrease in whipping of convicts, thus avoiding potentially inflammatory public displays. Clergyable discharge continued to be used when the accused could not be transported for reasons of age or infirmity.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 447</ref>\n\n====Women and children====\nPenal transportation was not limited to men or even to adults. Men, women, and children were sentenced to transportation, but its implementation varied by gender and age. From 1660 to 1670, highway robbery, [[burglary]], and [[horse theft]] were the offences most often punishable with transportation for men. In those years, five of the nine women who were transported after being sentenced to death were guilty of simple larceny, an offence for which [[benefit of clergy]] was not available for women until 1692.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 474</ref> Also, merchants preferred young and able-bodied men for whom there was a demand in the colonies.\n\nAll these factors meant that most women and children were simply left in jail.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\"/> Some magistrates supported a proposal to release women who could not be transported, but this solution was considered absurd: this caused the Lords Justices to order that no distinction be made between men and women.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 483</ref> Women were sent to the [[Leeward Islands]], the only colony that accepted them, and the government had to pay to send them overseas.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 482</ref> In 1696 [[Jamaica]] refused to welcome a group of prisoners because most of them were women; [[Barbados]] similarly accepted convicts but not \"women, children nor other infirm persons\".<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 481</ref>\n\nThanks to transportation, the number of men whipped and released diminished, but whipping and discharge were chosen more often for women. The reverse was true when women were sentenced for a capital offence, but actually served a lesser sentence due to a manipulation of the penal system: one advantage of this sentence was that they could be discharged thanks to benefit of clergy while men were whipped.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 444\">Beattie, 2001, p. 444</ref> Women with young children were also supported since transportation unavoidably separated them.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 444\"/> The facts and numbers revealed how transportation was less frequently applied to women and children because they were usually guilty of minor crimes and they were considered a minimal threat to the community.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 435\"/>\n\n====The end of transportation====\nThe outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) halted transportation to America. Parliament claimed that \"the transportation of convicts to his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America... is found to be attended with various inconveniences, particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community, and who, by proper care and correction, might be reclaimed from their evil course\"; they then passed \"An act to authorize... the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\"<ref name=\"BasAsylum\">Marilyn C. Baseler, [https://archive.org/details/asylumformankind00base/page/125 \"Asylum for Mankind\": America, 1607-1800], p.124-127</ref> For the ensuing decade, men were instead sentenced to hard labour and women were imprisoned. Finding alternative locations to send convicts was not easy, and the act was extended twice by the Criminal Law Act 1778 (18 Geo. 3 c. 62) and the Criminal Law Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3, c. 54).<ref>Drew D.

Both acts empowered the Crown to appoint certain places within his dominions, or outside them, as the destination for transported criminals; the acts would move convicts around the country as needed for labour, or where they could be utilized and accommodated.\n\nThe overcrowding situation and the resumption of transportation would be initially resolved by [[Orders in Council]] on 6 December 1785, by the decision to establish a penal colony in [[New South Wales]], on land previously claimed for Britain in 1770,<ref>{{cite news  | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63477180  | title = Historic Landmarks| newspaper  = [[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] | location   = Qld.  | date = 2 October 1952  | accessdate = 19 March 2017  | page = 5  | publisher  = National Library of Australia  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url  = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60569425  | title = Australian Discovery and Colonisation  | newspaper = [[Empire (newspaper)|The Empire]]  | location  = Sydney  | date = 14 April 1865  | page = 8  | publisher = National Library of Australia}}</ref> but as yet not settled by Britain or any other European power.

Although a concerted program of prison building ensued, the [[Short Titles Act 1896]] lists seven other laws relating to penal transportation in the first half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"ShTitl\">[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1896/act/14/enacted/en/print Short Titles Act 1896]</ref>\n\nThe system of criminal punishment by transportation, as it had developed over nearly 150 years, was officially ended in Britain in the 1850s, when that sentence was substituted by imprisonment with [[penal labor|penal servitude]], and intended to punish. The Penal Servitude Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 99), long titled \"An Act to substitute, in certain Cases, other Punishment in lieu of Transportation,\"<ref name=\"ShTitl\"/> enacted that with judicial discretion, lesser felonies, those subject to transportation for less than 14 years, could be sentenced to imprisonment with labour for a specific term. To provide confinement facilities, the general change in sentencing was passed in conjunction with the Convict Prisons Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 121), long titled \"An Act for providing Places of Confinement in England or Wales for Female Offenders under Sentence or Order of Transportation.\"<ref name=\"ShTitl\"/> The Penal Servitude Act 1857 (20 & 21 Vict. c. 3) ended the sentence of transportation in virtually all cases, with the terms of sentence initially being of the same duration as transportation.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1857/3/pdfs/ukpga_18570003_en.pdf Penal Servitude Act 1857]</ref><ref name=\"oldbaileyonline1\" /> While transport was greatly reduced following passage of the 1857 act, the last convicts sentenced to transportation arrived in Western Australia in 1868.

The fleet arrived at [[Port Jackson]] (Sydney) on 26 January 1788, a date now celebrated as [[Australia Day]]. [[Norfolk Island]] was a convict penal settlement from 1788\u201394, and again from 1824\u201347. The First Fleet included boats containing food and animals from London. The ships and boats of the fleet would explore the coast of Australia by sailing all around it looking for suitable farming land and resources. In 1803, [[Tasmania|Van Diemen's Land]] (modern-day Tasmania) was also settled as a penal colony, followed by the [[Queensland|Moreton Bay Settlement]] (Queensland) in 1824. The other [[States and territories of Australia|Australian colonies]] were \"free settlements\", as non-convict colonies were known.

The policy continued until February 1956, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in his speech ''[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences]]'' condemned the transportation as a violation of [[leninism|Leninist]] principles. Whilst the policy itself was rescinded, the transported populations did not begin to return to their original metropoles until after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991.<ref>{{cite book | last = Mawdsley | first = Evan | year = 1998 | title = The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union, 1929-1953 | publisher = Manchester University Press | isbn = 9780719046001 | lccn = 2003046365}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Performing arts===\n\nPenal transportation is a feature of many [[Broadside ballads|broadsides]], a new type of folk song that developed in eighteenth-century England.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Transportation Ballad: A Song Type Rooted in Eighteenth-Centry England | first = Andrew C. | last = Rouse | work = Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies (HJEAS) | volume = 13 | number = 1/2, The Long Eighteenth Century | date = Spring-Fall 2007 | pages = 93\u2013103 | publisher = Centre for Arts, Humanities and Sciences (CAHS), acting on behalf of the University of Debrecen CAHS | jstor = 41274385}}</ref> A number of these [[Transportation Ballads|transportation ballads]] have been collected from traditional singers.

[[Pip (Great Expectations)|Pip]] helps him in the opening pages of the novel, and he later turns out to be Pip's secret benefactor \u2013 the source of his \"great expectations\". Magwitch, who had been apprehended shortly after the young Pip had helped him, was thereafter sentenced to transportation for life to [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]]. While so exiled, he earned the fortune that he later would use to help Pip. Further, it was Magwitch's desire to see the \"gentleman\" that Pip had become that motivated him to illegally return to England, which ultimately led to his arrest and death. ''Great Expectations'' was published in [[Serial (literature)|serial form]] in 1860\u20131861.\n\n''My Transportation for Life'', Indian freedom fighter [[Veer Savarkar]]'s memoir of his imprisonment, is set in the British [[Cellular Jail]] in the [[Andaman Islands]].

The work was later adapted for several other media, including an opera by [[Philip Glass]].\n\nThe novel ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' tells the story of Henri Charri\u00e8re, a French man convicted of murder in 1931 and exiled to the French Guinea penal colony on [[Devil's Island]].
