They are commonly referred to as '''Oratorians''' ''(Oratorian Fathers)''.\n\nThis \"Congregation of the Oratory\" should not be confused with the French Oratory, a distinct congregation, the [[Oratory of Jesus|Society of the Oratory of Jesus]] (''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Oratoire de J\u00e9sus''), founded by [[Pierre de B\u00e9rulle]] in 1611 in [[Paris]].\n\nFounded in [[Rome]] in 1575 by St. [[Philip Neri]], today it has spread around the world, with over 70 Oratories and some 500 priests. The [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominal initials]] commonly used to identify members of the society are \"C.O.\" (''Congregatio Oratorii''). The abbreviation \"Cong. Orat.\" is also used.\n\nUnlike a [[religious institute]] (the members of which take vows and are answerable to a central authority) or a monastery (the monks of which are likewise bound by vows in a community that may itself be autonomous and answerable directly to the [[Pope]]), the Oratorians are made up of members who commit themselves to membership in a particular, independent, self-governing local community (an Oratory, usually named for the place in which it is located: e.g., Birmingham Oratory, Oxford Oratory, Brooklyn Oratory) without actually taking vows, an unusual and innovative arrangement created by St. Philip. Normally an oratory must have a minimum of four members, two being ordained, in order to be founded. If a group of men seeks to establish an oratory, they may apply to do so, going through the proper diocesan channels; during the process of formation a member (or members) of a well-established oratory resides in the community to facilitate every aspect of the proposed foundation.\n\n==History==\nThe Congregation of the Oratory was founded by St. [[Philip Neri]] (1515\u20131595) in the city of [[Rome]]. The first Oratory received papal recognition in 1575. The new community was to be a congregation of secular priests living under obedience but bound by no vows.<ref name=bowden/> Speaking of Neri, whom he called, \"the saint of joy\", Pope John Paul II said, \"As is well known, the saint used to put his teaching into short and wise maxims: 'Be good, if you can'... .He did not choose the life of solitude; but, in exercising his ministry among the common people, he also wished to be \"salt\" for all those who met him. Like Jesus, he was equally able to enter into the human misery present in the noble palaces and in the alleys of Renaissance Rome.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_07101994_filippo-neri_en.html|title=John Paul II, \"Letter Of His Holiness John Paul II On The Occasion Of The IV Centenary Of The Death Of St. Philip Neri\", 7 October 1994}}</ref>\n\nThe core of St. Philip's spirituality focused on an unpretentious return to the lifestyle of the first Disciples of Christ. The object of the institute is threefold: prayer, preaching, and the sacraments.<ref name=bowden>{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11272a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|chapter=The Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|last=Bowden|first=Henry Sebastian|volume=11|location=New York|publisher=[[Robert Appleton Company]]|date=1911|via=[[newadvent.org]]}}</ref>\n\nUp to 1800 the Oratory continued to spread through Italy, Sicily, Spain, Portugal, Poland, and other European countries; in South America, Brazil, India, and Ceylon. Under Napoleon I the Oratory was in various places despoiled and suppressed, but the congregation recovered and, after a second suppression in 1869, again revived.<ref name=bowden/> A few houses were founded in Munich and Vienna.\n\n==Governance==\nThere are eighty six Congregations of the Oratory throughout the world.  Each Community is autonomous, but there is a Confederation which facilitates contact with the Holy See.<ref name=toronto/> As such, the Congregation of the Oratory functions more like a monastic federation than like a religious institute.\n\nThree documents govern the Oratory. The first is the \"General Statutes\" of the Congregation, which are guidelines to be followed throughout the world; these may be changed or modified when representatives from each Oratory gather every six years in a meeting called a \"Congresso Generale\". The second is the \"Particular Statutes\", which outline how an individual Oratory is to be conducted; these must be approved by Rome. The third document is the \"Constitutions\", which establish general norms, and outline the relationship between the Congregation and the [[Holy See]]. As the Oratory is a [[confederation]], there is no central authority such as is found within the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Franciscans]], or [[Jesuits]].  The definitive foundation of an Oratorian Congregation is actually done by the Roman Pontiff directly, which makes a Congregation what is called a \"Pontifical Right\" foundation.<ref name=cincinnati>{{cite web|url=http://www.spncincinnati.com/?page_id=241|title=What is the Oratory?|date=19 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Confederation elects one of its own to represent the interests of the Congregations to the Holy See; this is done through the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life]]. This person, known as Procurator General, resides in Rome at the Procura General.\n\n==Daily life==\n[[Frederick William Faber]] described the Oratorian charism as \"a spirituality of everyday life\". The Oratory founded by St Philip Neri is a society of priests and brothers who live together under a Rule without taking religious vows. Hence, Oratorians are free to resign their membership in the Congregation without canonical impediment or ecclesiastical dispensation. An Oratorian resides in an Oratory community of his choosing and is permanently stable, i.e., he is not subject to transfer to other Oratories or communities.<ref name=cincinnati/> Oratorians have what is called 'stability,' which means they are committed as members of the community of a particular Oratory, though a member may move if there is a serious enough reason.\n\nAs there is no vow of poverty, Oratorians may keep their possessions, and those who can afford to do so are expected to contribute to the support of the house. It is possible for an ordained secular priest to join the Community if he feels called to a more recollected life in community than is possible in a diocesan presbytery, however the Constitutions do not permit anyone who has been a solemnly professed religious to join the Congregation. Neither is it customary to admit anyone over the age of forty five.<ref>[http://www.birminghamoratory.org.uk/ \"Vocations\", Birmingham Oratory]</ref>\n\nUnlike the members of some [[religious institute]]<nowiki/>s, Oratorians are not bound by a rule to pray in common, though this is something that Oratorians consider important, and they commit themselves to praying together at least twice each day, and having one communal meal which is usually dinner. Oratorians normally have a set time each day for praying together in silent meditation; this ends classically with the recitation of a [[litany]].\n\nAlthough some oratories may have a dominant mission (e.g. the [[London Oratory]], which maintains [[London Oratory School|a school]]), in general the members of the Oratory spend the day involved in various ministries: teaching, parish work, [[spirituality|spiritual]] direction, campus ministry, hospital chaplaincies, administration or maintaining the fabric of the community house. Some oratories are specifically connected with parishes and thus its members serve as clergy of the parish.<ref name=cincinnati/>\n\n==Habit==\n[[File:John Henry Newman - Project Gutenberg 13103.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|John Henry Newman and the Oratorian collar]]\nAs [[secular clergy]], Oratorians wear a dress similar to that of [[diocesan priests]]. However, the black [[cassock]] is worn with a distinctive Oratorian clerical collar: a white cloth that folds over the collar all around the neck, with a number of folds inward, indicating the particular oratory from which the priest originates. The cassock is bound by a [[Fascia (vestment)|fascia]]. The habit is given at formal reception into the community which comes after a few months of living together to see if the candidate fits in well. Members often, but do not necessarily, wear the cassock whilst engaged in their respective ministries. When not wearing the cassock, members of the Oratory would wear the normal street clothes of a cleric, such as a clerical shirt, but with the Oratorian collar. In some countries such as [[Spain]], Oratorians do not wear the distinctive Oratorian cassock and collar, making them indistinguishable from other secular priests.\n\n==Oratories around the world==\n\nAs of 2014, the website of the oratory's \"headquarters\" in Rome lists the following as some of the numerous congregations throughout the world:\n\n===Continental Europe===\nThere are oratories in: Vienna, Austria; [[Dijon]], [[Hy\u00e8res]], and [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France; Acireale, Biella, Bologna, Brescia, Florence, Genoa, Naples, Palermo, Rome, Verona, Prato and Vicenza, Italy; [[Germany]] ([[Aachen]], [[Aufhausen]], [[Dresden]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Hannover]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Leipzig]], Celle and [[Munich]]); [[Lithuania]] ([[Vilnius]]); [[Netherlands]] ([[Maastricht]]); [[Poland]] ([[Gosty\u0144]], [[Studzianna]], [[Tarn\u00f3w]], [[Radom]], Bytow, [[Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki]] and [[Pozna\u0144]]); [[Portugal]] (Convento e Pal\u00e1cio de Nossa Senhora das Necessidades), [[Lisboa]]);[[Spain]] ([[Barcelona]], [[Seville]], Porreras, Albacete, Vic, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Getafe, Tudela, Soller and [[Palma de Mallorca|Palma]]) and [[Switzerland]] ([[Zurich]]).

Its church, the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], was consecrated on 16 April 1884 and is the second largest Roman Catholic church in London.\n\nA House also exists in [[Oxford]] (the [[Oxford Oratory]]).

The object of the institute is threefold: prayer, preaching, and the sacraments.<ref name=bowden>{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11272a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|chapter=The Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|last=Bowden|first=Henry Sebastian|volume=11|location=New York|publisher=[[Robert Appleton Company]]|date=1911|via=[[newadvent.org]]}}</ref>\n\nUp to 1800 the Oratory continued to spread through Italy, Sicily, Spain, Portugal, Poland, and other European countries; in South America, Brazil, India, and Ceylon. Under Napoleon I the Oratory was in various places despoiled and suppressed, but the congregation recovered and, after a second suppression in 1869, again revived.<ref name=bowden/> A few houses were founded in Munich and Vienna.\n\n==Governance==\nThere are eighty six Congregations of the Oratory throughout the world.  Each Community is autonomous, but there is a Confederation which facilitates contact with the Holy See.<ref name=toronto/> As such, the Congregation of the Oratory functions more like a monastic federation than like a religious institute.\n\nThree documents govern the Oratory. The first is the \"General Statutes\" of the Congregation, which are guidelines to be followed throughout the world; these may be changed or modified when representatives from each Oratory gather every six years in a meeting called a \"Congresso Generale\". The second is the \"Particular Statutes\", which outline how an individual Oratory is to be conducted; these must be approved by Rome. The third document is the \"Constitutions\", which establish general norms, and outline the relationship between the Congregation and the [[Holy See]]. As the Oratory is a [[confederation]], there is no central authority such as is found within the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Franciscans]], or [[Jesuits]].  The definitive foundation of an Oratorian Congregation is actually done by the Roman Pontiff directly, which makes a Congregation what is called a \"Pontifical Right\" foundation.<ref name=cincinnati>{{cite web|url=http://www.spncincinnati.com/?page_id=241|title=What is the Oratory?|date=19 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Confederation elects one of its own to represent the interests of the Congregations to the Holy See; this is done through the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life]]. This person, known as Procurator General, resides in Rome at the Procura General.\n\n==Daily life==\n[[Frederick William Faber]] described the Oratorian charism as \"a spirituality of everyday life\". The Oratory founded by St Philip Neri is a society of priests and brothers who live together under a Rule without taking religious vows. Hence, Oratorians are free to resign their membership in the Congregation without canonical impediment or ecclesiastical dispensation. An Oratorian resides in an Oratory community of his choosing and is permanently stable, i.e., he is not subject to transfer to other Oratories or communities.<ref name=cincinnati/> Oratorians have what is called 'stability,' which means they are committed as members of the community of a particular Oratory, though a member may move if there is a serious enough reason.\n\nAs there is no vow of poverty, Oratorians may keep their possessions, and those who can afford to do so are expected to contribute to the support of the house. It is possible for an ordained secular priest to join the Community if he feels called to a more recollected life in community than is possible in a diocesan presbytery, however the Constitutions do not permit anyone who has been a solemnly professed religious to join the Congregation. Neither is it customary to admit anyone over the age of forty five.<ref>[http://www.birminghamoratory.org.uk/ \"Vocations\", Birmingham Oratory]</ref>\n\nUnlike the members of some [[religious institute]]<nowiki/>s, Oratorians are not bound by a rule to pray in common, though this is something that Oratorians consider important, and they commit themselves to praying together at least twice each day, and having one communal meal which is usually dinner. Oratorians normally have a set time each day for praying together in silent meditation; this ends classically with the recitation of a [[litany]].\n\nAlthough some oratories may have a dominant mission (e.g. the [[London Oratory]], which maintains [[London Oratory School|a school]]), in general the members of the Oratory spend the day involved in various ministries: teaching, parish work, [[spirituality|spiritual]] direction, campus ministry, hospital chaplaincies, administration or maintaining the fabric of the community house. Some oratories are specifically connected with parishes and thus its members serve as clergy of the parish.<ref name=cincinnati/>\n\n==Habit==\n[[File:John Henry Newman - Project Gutenberg 13103.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|John Henry Newman and the Oratorian collar]]\nAs [[secular clergy]], Oratorians wear a dress similar to that of [[diocesan priests]]. However, the black [[cassock]] is worn with a distinctive Oratorian clerical collar: a white cloth that folds over the collar all around the neck, with a number of folds inward, indicating the particular oratory from which the priest originates. The cassock is bound by a [[Fascia (vestment)|fascia]]. The habit is given at formal reception into the community which comes after a few months of living together to see if the candidate fits in well. Members often, but do not necessarily, wear the cassock whilst engaged in their respective ministries. When not wearing the cassock, members of the Oratory would wear the normal street clothes of a cleric, such as a clerical shirt, but with the Oratorian collar. In some countries such as [[Spain]], Oratorians do not wear the distinctive Oratorian cassock and collar, making them indistinguishable from other secular priests.\n\n==Oratories around the world==\n\nAs of 2014, the website of the oratory's \"headquarters\" in Rome lists the following as some of the numerous congregations throughout the world:\n\n===Continental Europe===\nThere are oratories in: Vienna, Austria; [[Dijon]], [[Hy\u00e8res]], and [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France; Acireale, Biella, Bologna, Brescia, Florence, Genoa, Naples, Palermo, Rome, Verona, Prato and Vicenza, Italy; [[Germany]] ([[Aachen]], [[Aufhausen]], [[Dresden]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Hannover]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Leipzig]], Celle and [[Munich]]); [[Lithuania]] ([[Vilnius]]); [[Netherlands]] ([[Maastricht]]); [[Poland]] ([[Gosty\u0144]], [[Studzianna]], [[Tarn\u00f3w]], [[Radom]], Bytow, [[Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki]] and [[Pozna\u0144]]); [[Portugal]] (Convento e Pal\u00e1cio de Nossa Senhora das Necessidades), [[Lisboa]]);[[Spain]] ([[Barcelona]], [[Seville]], Porreras, Albacete, Vic, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Getafe, Tudela, Soller and [[Palma de Mallorca|Palma]]) and [[Switzerland]] ([[Zurich]]). There are also Oratories in formation in Bratislava, Slovakia and Mikulov in the Czech Republic.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[Saint]] [[John Henry Newman]] founded the first Oratory in the [[English (language)|English]]-speaking world when he established the [[Birmingham Oratory]] in the city of [[Birmingham]] on 2 February 1848.<ref name=toronto>{{cite web|url=https://oratory-toronto.org/oratorian-origins/|title=SPN Oratory|first=Martin|last=Hilbert|website=oratory-toronto.org}}</ref> This was initially located at Old Oscott, which Newman renamed Maryvale (after the Oratory church in Rome, [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]]). After a couple of moves this community eventually settled in [[Edgbaston]].<ref>[http://www.birminghamoratory.org.uk/ Birmingham Oratory]</ref> Attached to the Birmingham Oratory was the [[The Oratory School|Oratory School]] now at [[Woodcote]], [[Berkshire]], near [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].\n\nIn 1849 a second congregation was founded in King William Street, Strand, London (the [[London Oratory]]), with [[Frederick William Faber]] as superior; in 1854 it was transferred to Brompton. Its church, the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], was consecrated on 16 April 1884 and is the second largest Roman Catholic church in London.\n\nA House also exists in [[Oxford]] (the [[Oxford Oratory]]). As of October 2013, the church of [[St Wilfrid's, York]], was turned over to the Oxford Oratorians on the retirement of the incumbent parish priest<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stwilfridsyork.org.uk/blog/post/6-thank-you-to-canon-ryan/|title=Thank You to Canon Ryan|publisher=St Wilfrid's Catholic Church, York|date=29 October 2013}}</ref> and is now canonically established, known as the York Oratory.
