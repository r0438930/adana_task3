The first stage of a new colony is known as the pre-emergence state, in which workers have not been produced. No adult offspring are present and the larvae are still very young. A pre-emergent colony can have one or more queens.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\nFollowing the pre-emergent state, the colony grows to the emergent stage.

Wasps containing undeveloped filamentous [[ovariole]]s, slightly developed oocytes, or some mature oocytes are considered workers and intermediates. Wasps with well-developed and longer ovarioles with mature oocytes become queens. The number of queens in the colony determines the development of a queen\u2019s ovaries. If there are more queens present, the ovaries are at a lower degree of development. One benefit to this is that as a swarming insect, queens with smaller abdomens are able to fly more easily  than queens with larger abdomens. This makes the queen less susceptible to predators.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\n===Foraging===\n\nForaging activity for the swarm-founding wasp ''S. cyanea'' begins early in the morning and stops in the evening. During the hottest hours of the day, activity of the wasps is highest. In addition to temperature, ''S. cyanea'' increase their activity with decreased levels of humidity and heightened intensities of light. While foraging, the wasps collect water for temperature control, wood pulp for building and repairing the nest, sugary substances for both the larvae and adults and finally animal protein for larvae.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>\n\n===Nest repair===\n\nFollowing damage by rain to the nest, ''S. cyanea'' will seal a leak of water with their mouth-pieces. Individuals begin by suctioning the water from the wall of the nest and then finish by expelling the water to the exterior of the colony. The hole is then repaired using wood pulp.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>\n\n==Kin selection==\n\n===Worker-queen conflict===\n\nIn ''S. cyanea'', discrimination between the queen and workers is often not determined by morphology, but by physiology. Young females in the colony can develop ovaries at different points in the cycle, so castes must be determined by the adult wasps rather than at the larval stage. Often, adult wasps will manipulate young females and suppress their ovaries because a wasp becomes a queen once she has mated. The number of queens allowed in a nest often fluctuates.

Since ''S. cyanea ''may obtain many nutrients from these fruit trees, researchers have observed the predatory nature of these wasps on ''Z. indianus''. When ''S. cyanea'' detect the fruit fly larvae, they soften, remove, and transport them back to the colony. For this reason, many fruit farmers consider ''S. cyanea'' a prospective candidate for use in pest management.<ref>{{Cite journal|url =http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/82345 |title = Predation of Zaprinus indianus (Diptera: Drosophilidae) by the Social Wasp Synoeca cyanea (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|last = Prezoto|first = Fabio|date = 2013|journal = Florida Entomologist|accessdate = |doi = 10.1653/024.096.0243|pmid = |volume = 96|pages = 670\u2013672|issue = 2|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q10375500}}\n\n[[Category:Vespidae]]\n[[Category:Insects of South America]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1775]]\n", "text_old": "{{Speciesbox\n| image = Marimbondo Tatu.JPG \n| image_caption = A nest of ''S. cyanea''\n| taxon = Synoeca cyanea\n| display_parents = 3\n| authority = ([[Johan Christian Fabricius|Fabricius]], 1775)\n| synonyms =\n''Vespa cyanea'' Fabricius 1775<br>\n''Synoeca azurea'' Saussure 1852<br>\n''Synoeca ultramarina'' Saussure 1852<br>\n''Synoeca violacea'' Saussure 1852\n}}\n\n'''''Synoeca cyanea''''', commonly known as marimbondo-tatu, is a swarm-founding social wasp.

Either a human may receive no more than one or two stings, or a swarm may attack a human. Symptoms following the attack can range from inflammatory reactions to severe allergic reactions resulting in anaphylactic shock. In some cases, death may occur following several bites{{clarify|date=September 2017}}<!--why should bites be significant?--> and a large amount of venom injection; however, a wasp sting typically will not produce a reaction more severe than local symptoms that affect only the skin.<ref name=\"Mortari 2012\"/>\n\n=== Biocontrol Agent ===\nIn Brazil, the fruit fly, ''Zaprionus indianus'', is a common pest species that inflicts damage to multiple types of fruit trees. Since ''S. cyanea ''may obtain many nutrients from these fruit trees, researchers have observed the predatory nature of these wasps on ''Z. indianus''. When ''S. cyanea'' detect the fruit fly larvae, they soften, remove, and transport them back to the colony. For this reason, many fruit farmers consider ''S. cyanea'' a prospective candidate for use in pest management.<ref>{{Cite journal|url =http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/82345 |title = Predation of Zaprinus indianus (Diptera: Drosophilidae) by the Social Wasp Synoeca cyanea (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|last = Prezoto|first = Fabio|date = 2013|journal = Florida Entomologist|accessdate = |doi = 10.1653/024.096.0243|pmid = |volume = 96|pages = 670\u2013672|issue = 2|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q10375500}}\n\n[[Category:Vespidae]]\n[[Category:Insects of South America]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1775]]\n", "name_user": "123.243.255.215", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoeca_cyanea"}
