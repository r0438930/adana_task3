Bury finished the 2018\u201319 season as runners-up in [[EFL League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]], and were promoted to [[EFL League One]] for the 2019\u201320 season. The team were unable to begin the season because of the club's longstanding financial issues and, on 27 August 2019, Bury were expelled from the [[English Football League]] (EFL). In December 2019 and February 2020, the club survived [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) winding-up petitions in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]; it still exists but with no league membership, and, {{As of|alt=as of late April 2020|2020|04\n|post=,}} is at risk of liquidation.\n\nKnown as \"The Shakers\", the team play in white shirts and navy blue shorts. [[Gigg Lane]], one of the world's oldest football grounds, has been the club's home venue since 1885. The club's location led to local derby games with numerous clubs and Bury has long-standing rivalries with near neighbours [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].\n\nEstablished in 1885, Bury were founder members of the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] in 1889, and were crowned champions in the 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 seasons, before being elected to The Football League (now known as the EFL) in 1894. They won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1894\u201395 and won their [[test match (association football)|test match]] to secure promotion into the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. They remained in the top flight for 17 seasons, winning the [[FA Cup]] in [[1900 FA Cup Final|1900]] with a 4\u20130 victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and again in [[1903 FA Cup Final|1903]] with a 6\u20130 win over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. This remains a record winning margin in an FA Cup final, equalled only once, when [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] beat [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the [[2019 FA Cup Final|2019 final]].\n\nThey were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1911\u201312 season, before securing promotion again in 1923\u201324. Bury lost their top-flight status in 1928\u201329 and have not returned. They dropped into the third tier in 1956\u201357, before winning promotion as champions of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] under the stewardship of [[Dave Russell (footballer)|Dave Russell]] in 1960\u201361. From 1967 to 1971 they were promoted once but, with three relegations, found themselves in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time.\n\nBury won promotion at the end of the 1973\u201374 campaign and remained in the Third Division until 1979\u201380. They were in the fourth tier in September 1995 when [[Stan Ternent]] took over as team manager. He led them back to the second tier for the first time in 28 years after securing two consecutive promotions in 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397 \u2013 winning promotion as champions in the latter campaign. They remained there for just two seasons and were relegated twice in four seasons, before securing promotion out of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in 2010\u201311. They then switched between [[EFL League One|Leagues One]] and Two, being twice relegated (in 2012\u201313 and 2017\u201318) and twice promoted (in 2014\u201315 and 2018\u201319).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1885\u20131895)===\nBury Football Club was founded on 24 April 1885 after Aiden Arrowsmith,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.buryfc.co.uk/siteassets/pdf/commercial/commercial-brochure.pdf |title=History is made |publisher=Bury Football Club |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref> a local enthusiast, had brokered two meetings between church teams Bury Wesleyans and Bury Unitarians at the Waggon & Horses Hotel and the White Horse Hotel.<ref name=\"RG106\">{{cite book |title=Rough Guide to English Football |last=Goldstein |first=Dan |date=2000 |publisher=Rough Guides Ltd |page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoengl00dang/page/106 106] |isbn=1-85828-557-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoengl00dang/page/106 }}</ref> It was agreed from the outset that the team should be professional.

The semi-final against Forest was played at Stoke and ended 1\u20131 after Bury missed a penalty. A replay was held at [[Bramall Lane]] in Sheffield and Bury began disastrously by conceding two goals in the first two minutes. [[Charlie Sagar]] pulled one back after 55 minutes and then [[Jasper McLuckie]] equalised with only five minutes to go. Extra time was played and Sagar scored the winner after 110 minutes of play. The final at the old Crystal Palace ground was played in a heatwave and Bury, captained by [[Jack Pray]], dominated from the start. The goals in a one-sided match were scored by McLuckie (2), [[Willie Wood (footballer)|Willie Wood]] and [[John Plant (footballer)|John Plant]].

En route to the final against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], Bury defeated [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], Sheffield United, Notts County and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. As in 1900, the final was played at the old Crystal Palace ground in south London. A crowd of 63,102 attended. As the two teams wore identical kits, agreement on colours for the day was necessary and they both changed with Bury wearing Cambridge blue shirts and navy shorts while Derby chose red shirts and black shorts.<ref name=\"TFACW\"/>\n\nSix of Bury's 1900 finalists were in the 1903 team, led by skipper [[George Ross (footballer, born 1869)|George Ross]] who scored the opening goal after 20 minutes. Derby's keeper [[Jack Fryer (footballer, born 1877)|Jack Fryer]] played despite an existing injury which he aggravated early in the second half when he was trying to prevent Charlie Sagar from scoring Bury's second goal. As a result, Fryer was forced to leave the field and, as substitutes were not allowed then, one of the full-backs deputised in goal and their team was down to ten men for most of the last forty minutes. Bury scored three goals in four minutes just before the hour was up and their sixth after 76 minutes. [[Joe Leeming]] scored the third and last goals. Willie Wood and John Plant scored the other two. The final was a no contest and Derby were lambasted by the press for their poor performance. One reporter commented that, but for being merciful, Bury should have scored twenty.<ref name=\"TFACW\"/> Bury's 6\u20130 win established an FA Cup final record for the biggest winning margin. Bury remained sole holders of the record until the 2019 final in which [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] defeated [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] by the same score.

The first specialist team manager was goalkeeper [[Archie Montgomery]] who was appointed on 1 February 1907. He was in charge when the team were relegated in 1912 and stayed on until 30 April 1915 when he was dismissed because of the club's lack of income in wartime.<ref name=\"FMBFC\"/> The club had a windfall in 1922 when [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby]], unexpectedly gifted them with the freehold of Gigg Lane. The team returned to the First Division for a five-season spell in 1924 and achieved their highest-ever league position, fourth, in [[1925\u201326 Football League|1925\u201326]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> After relegation back to the Second Division in 1929, Bury have not played in the top flight.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\n===1929\u20131969===\n[[File:Bury FC League Performance.svg|right|thumb|600px|Chart of table positions of Bury in the Football League.]]\nStriving to recover First Division status, Bury had four top six finishes in Division Two in the 1930s. The closest that they have ever come to a top flight return was in [[1936\u201337 Football League|1936\u201337]] when they finished third (only the first two teams were promoted).<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nWith league football suspended for the duration of [[World War II]], Bury took part in the wartime competitions and, like all other clubs, often relied on guest players because of service calls. They had a successful season in 1939\u201340 and won the North West Regional League Championship.<ref name=\"DSWF\">{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=Gordon |title=The DataSport Book of Wartime Football: 1939\u201346 |publisher=DataSport |date=1989 |page=18}}</ref> The team were unbeaten in a sequence of 16 matches from October to February.<ref name=\"GA11\">Andrews, p. 11.</ref> On 30 December 1939, they played a friendly against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] which resulted in a 7\u20136 win for Bury.<ref name=\"GA11\"/>\n\nBury were close to relegation from the Second Division several times after the war. They finally dropped into the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] for the first time in 1957. 1957\u201358 was that division's last season before the regional sections were amalgamated into national [[Football League Third Division|Third]] and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Divisions]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nUnder manager [[Dave Russell (footballer)|Dave Russell]], a young Bury team were Third Division champions in 1960\u201361.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> They spent seven of the next eight seasons back in the Second Division with a best position of eighth in 1962\u201363.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> In the [[1962\u201363 Football League Cup]], they reached the semi-final but lost 4\u20133 [[two-legged tie|on aggregate]] to eventual winners [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> For three seasons from 1963, Bury's best player was the future England midfielder [[Colin Bell]], who was team captain while still a teenager. He transferred to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1966 and Bury were relegated the following season. They bounced straight back as Third Division runners-up in 1968 but went down again in 1969.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\n===1969\u20132000===\nIn 1971, relegation from Division Three took Bury into the Fourth Division for the first time. They gained promotion in 1974 and spent six seasons in the Third Division before the next relegation.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> The club celebrated its centenary in 1985 by gaining promotion back to the Third Division.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nBury came close to promotion from the Third Division in both 1990 and 1991 when they finished fifth and seventh respectively to qualify for the play-offs. They were eliminated at the semi-final stage in both play-offs, losing 2\u20130 on aggregate to [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in 1990 and 2\u20131 on aggregate to neighbours [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> Relegation followed in 1992 and then Bury qualified for the fourth-tier play-off in 1993 by finishing seventh but, yet again, lost their semi-final tie by going down 1\u20130 on aggregate to [[York City F.C.|York City]]. Bury were back in the play-offs again in 1995 after finishing fourth. This time, they won their semi-final by beating [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 2\u20130 on aggregate and so went to Wembley for the final, where they lost 2\u20130 to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nThe club then enjoyed a resurgence under manager [[Stan Ternent]] who engineered two successive promotions in the mid-1990s. In 1996, third place in what was now the fourth-tier Division Three, followed by the third-tier Division Two title in [[1996\u201397 Bury F.C. season|1996\u201397]], brought Bury back to the second tier for the first time in thirty years.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> They went back to the third tier on the last day of the 1998\u201399 season on the basis of having a lower [[goals scored]] total than [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], the League having decided to use this metric rather than [[goal difference]] as its tie-breaker. Bury's goal difference was higher than that of Port Vale, and the League reinstated goal difference as the tie-breaker for the following season.\n\n===2001\u20132019===\nIn 2001\u201302, financial problems caused by the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] brought the club into [[administration (British football)|administration]] and to the brink of folding.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/david-conn-burys-begging-bowl-may-not-avert-closure-9161973.html |title=Bury's begging bowl may not avert closure |first=David |last=Conn |publisher=The Independent |location=London |date=22 February 2002 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1848370.stm |title=Shakers face court's final whistle |publisher=BBC News |date=1 March 2002 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> A supporters' campaign raised enough money to keep the club afloat,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buryfc.co.uk/fans/view/page/0,,10422,00.html |title=Save Our Shakers |publisher=Bury Football Club |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020403014508/http://www.buryfc.co.uk/fans/view/page/0%2C%2C10422%2C00.html |archivedate= 3 April 2002 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foreverbury.org/?page_id=2 |title=Background |publisher=Forever Bury: The Bury FC Supporters Society |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> and in recognition of his role within that process, [[UEFA]] presented club press officer Gordon Sorfleet with their Best Supporter award for 2001\u201302.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/news/newsid=29981.html |title=Zidane honoured at Gala night |publisher=UEFA |date=12 August 2002 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/zidane-totti-and-a-star-struck-shaker-175693.html |title=Zidane, Totti and a star-struck Shaker |first=Nick |last=Harris |publisher=The Independent |location=London |date=2 September 2002 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> Bury were relegated to fourth-tier Division Three at the end of that season.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> They finished seventh in 2003 and qualified for the play-offs but, yet again, their semi-final hoodoo struck and they were beaten 3\u20131 on aggregate by [[A.

The club's location led to local derby games with numerous clubs and Bury has long-standing rivalries with near neighbours [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].\n\nEstablished in 1885, Bury were founder members of the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] in 1889, and were crowned champions in the 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 seasons, before being elected to The Football League (now known as the EFL) in 1894. They won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1894\u201395 and won their [[test match (association football)|test match]] to secure promotion into the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. They remained in the top flight for 17 seasons, winning the [[FA Cup]] in [[1900 FA Cup Final|1900]] with a 4\u20130 victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and again in [[1903 FA Cup Final|1903]] with a 6\u20130 win over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. This remains a record winning margin in an FA Cup final, equalled only once, when [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] beat [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the [[2019 FA Cup Final|2019 final]].\n\nThey were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1911\u201312 season, before securing promotion again in 1923\u201324. Bury lost their top-flight status in 1928\u201329 and have not returned. They dropped into the third tier in 1956\u201357, before winning promotion as champions of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] under the stewardship of [[Dave Russell (footballer)|Dave Russell]] in 1960\u201361. From 1967 to 1971 they were promoted once but, with three relegations, found themselves in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time.\n\nBury won promotion at the end of the 1973\u201374 campaign and remained in the Third Division until 1979\u201380. They were in the fourth tier in September 1995 when [[Stan Ternent]] took over as team manager. He led them back to the second tier for the first time in 28 years after securing two consecutive promotions in 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397 \u2013 winning promotion as champions in the latter campaign. They remained there for just two seasons and were relegated twice in four seasons, before securing promotion out of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in 2010\u201311. They then switched between [[EFL League One|Leagues One]] and Two, being twice relegated (in 2012\u201313 and 2017\u201318) and twice promoted (in 2014\u201315 and 2018\u201319).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1885\u20131895)===\nBury Football Club was founded on 24 April 1885 after Aiden Arrowsmith,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.buryfc.co.uk/siteassets/pdf/commercial/commercial-brochure.pdf |title=History is made |publisher=Bury Football Club |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref> a local enthusiast, had brokered two meetings between church teams Bury Wesleyans and Bury Unitarians at the Waggon & Horses Hotel and the White Horse Hotel.<ref name=\"RG106\">{{cite book |title=Rough Guide to English Football |last=Goldstein |first=Dan |date=2000 |publisher=Rough Guides Ltd |page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoengl00dang/page/106 106] |isbn=1-85828-557-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoengl00dang/page/106 }}</ref> It was agreed from the outset that the team should be professional.

The semi-final against Forest was played at Stoke and ended 1\u20131 after Bury missed a penalty.

As in 1900, the final was played at the old Crystal Palace ground in south London. A crowd of 63,102 attended.

As a result, Fryer was forced to leave the field and, as substitutes were not allowed then, one of the full-backs deputised in goal and their team was down to ten men for most of the last forty minutes. Bury scored three goals in four minutes just before the hour was up and their sixth after 76 minutes. [[Joe Leeming]] scored the third and last goals. Willie Wood and John Plant scored the other two. The final was a no contest and Derby were lambasted by the press for their poor performance. One reporter commented that, but for being merciful, Bury should have scored twenty.<ref name=\"TFACW\"/> Bury's 6\u20130 win established an FA Cup final record for the biggest winning margin.

The first specialist team manager was goalkeeper [[Archie Montgomery]] who was appointed on 1 February 1907. He was in charge when the team were relegated in 1912 and stayed on until 30 April 1915 when he was dismissed because of the club's lack of income in wartime.<ref name=\"FMBFC\"/> The club had a windfall in 1922 when [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby]], unexpectedly gifted them with the freehold of Gigg Lane. The team returned to the First Division for a five-season spell in 1924 and achieved their highest-ever league position, fourth, in [[1925\u201326 Football League|1925\u201326]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> After relegation back to the Second Division in 1929, Bury have not played in the top flight.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\n===1929\u20131969===\n[[File:Bury FC League Performance.svg|right|thumb|600px|Chart of table positions of Bury in the Football League.]]\nStriving to recover First Division status, Bury had four top six finishes in Division Two in the 1930s.

They had a successful season in 1939\u201340 and won the North West Regional League Championship.<ref name=\"DSWF\">{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=Gordon |title=The DataSport Book of Wartime Football: 1939\u201346 |publisher=DataSport |date=1989 |page=18}}</ref> The team were unbeaten in a sequence of 16 matches from October to February.<ref name=\"GA11\">Andrews, p. 11.</ref> On 30 December 1939, they played a friendly against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] which resulted in a 7\u20136 win for Bury.<ref name=\"GA11\"/>\n\nBury were close to relegation from the Second Division several times after the war.

They bounced straight back as Third Division runners-up in 1968 but went down again in 1969.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\n===1969\u20132000===\nIn 1971, relegation from Division Three took Bury into the Fourth Division for the first time.

They were eliminated at the semi-final stage in both play-offs, losing 2\u20130 on aggregate to [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in 1990 and 2\u20131 on aggregate to neighbours [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> Relegation followed in 1992 and then Bury qualified for the fourth-tier play-off in 1993 by finishing seventh but, yet again, lost their semi-final tie by going down 1\u20130 on aggregate to [[York City F.C.|York City]]. Bury were back in the play-offs again in 1995 after finishing fourth. This time, they won their semi-final by beating [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 2\u20130 on aggregate and so went to Wembley for the final, where they lost 2\u20130 to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nThe club then enjoyed a resurgence under manager [[Stan Ternent]] who engineered two successive promotions in the mid-1990s. In 1996, third place in what was now the fourth-tier Division Three, followed by the third-tier Division Two title in [[1996\u201397 Bury F.C. season|1996\u201397]], brought Bury back to the second tier for the first time in thirty years.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> They went back to the third tier on the last day of the 1998\u201399 season on the basis of having a lower [[goals scored]] total than [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], the League having decided to use this metric rather than [[goal difference]] as its tie-breaker.
