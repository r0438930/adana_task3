My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like ''Danny Boy'' from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn the day before [[St. Patrick's Day]] 2007, she performed as part of Celtic Woman for President [[George W.
