Here, the R groups can be organic fragments (a carbon atom, with arbitrary other atoms attached to that) or [[hydrogen]], while the R' groups must be organic fragments not hydrogen. The two R' groups can be equivalent to each other (a \"symmetric acetal\") or not (a \"mixed acetal\"). Acetals are formed from and convertible to [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s and have the same [[oxidation state]] at the central carbon, but have substantially different chemical stability and reactivity as compared to the analogous [[carbonyl]] compounds. The central carbon atom has four bonds to it, and is therefore [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated]] and has [[tetrahedral geometry]].\n\nThe term '''ketal''' is sometimes used to identify structures associated with [[ketone]]s (both R groups organic fragments rather than hydrogen) rather than [[aldehyde]]s and, historically, the term '''acetal''' was used specifically for the aldehyde-related cases (having at least one hydrogen in place of an R on the central carbon).<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=ketals|file=K03376}}</ref>  The IUPAC originally deprecated the usage of the word ketal altogether, but has since reversed its decision.  However, in contrast to historical usage, ketals are now a subset of acetals, a term that now encompasses all both aldehyde- and ketone-derived structures.\n\nIf one of the R groups has an oxygen as the first atom (that is, there are more than two oxygens single-bonded to the central carbon), the functional group is instead an [[orthoester]]. In contrast to variations of R, both R' groups are organic fragments. If one R' is a hydrogen, the functional group is instead a [[hemiacetal]], while if both are H, the functional group is a ketone [[hydrate]] or aldehyde hydrate.\n\nFormation of an acetal occurs when the [[hydroxyl]] group of a [[hemiacetal]] becomes [[protonation|protonated]] and is lost as water. The [[carbocation]] that is produced is then rapidly attacked by a molecule of [[alcohol]]. Loss of the proton from the attached alcohol gives the acetal.\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | align             = center\n | direction         = vertical\n | header_align      = center\n | total_width       = 428\n | image1            = Acetal formation 2.png\n | caption1          = Aldehyde to acetal conversion\n | image2            = Ketal formation.png\n | caption2          = Ketone to ketal conversion\n}}\n\nAcetals are stable compared to hemiacetals but their formation is a reversible [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] as with [[ester]]s. As a reaction to create an acetal proceeds, water must be removed from the reaction mixture, for example, with a [[Dean\u2013Stark apparatus]], lest it [[hydrolyse]] the product back to the hemiacetal. The formation of acetals reduces the total number of molecules present (carbonyl + 2 alcohol \u2192 acetal + water) and therefore is generally not favourable with regards to [[entropy]]. One situation where it is not entropically unfavourable is when a single [[diol]] molecule is used rather than two separate alcohol molecules (carbonyl + diol \u2192 acetal + water). Another way to avoid the entropic cost is to perform the synthesis by acetal exchange, using a pre-existing acetal-type reagent as the OR'-group donor rather than simple addition of alcohols themselves. One type of reagent used for this method is an orthoester. In this case, water produced along with the acetal product is destroyed when it hydrolyses residual orthoester molecules, and this [[side reaction]] also produces more alcohol to be used in the main reaction.\n\nAcetals are used as [[protecting group]]s for [[carbonyl]] groups in organic synthesis because they are stable with respect to hydrolysis by [[base (chemistry)|bases]] and with respect to many oxidizing and reducing agents. They can either protect the carbonyl in a molecule (by temporarily reacting it with an alcohol) or a diol (by temporarily reacting it with a carbonyl). That is, either the carbonyl, or the alcohols, or both could be part of the molecule whose reactivity is to be controlled.\n\nVarious specific carbonyl compounds have special names for their acetal forms. For example, an acetal formed from [[formaldehyde]] (two hydrogens attached to the central carbon) is sometimes called a ''formal''<ref>Morrison, Robert T. and Boyd, Robert N., \"Organic Chemistry (6th ed)\". p683. Prentice-Hall Inc (1992).</ref> or the [[methylenedioxy]] group. The acetal formed from [[acetone]] is sometimes called an [[acetonide]].\n\n==Acetalisation==\nAcetalisation is the [[organic reaction]] that involves the formation of an acetal (or ketals). One way of acetal formation is the [[nucleophilic addition]] of an alcohol to a ketone or an aldehyde. Acetalisation is often used in organic synthesis to create a protecting group because it is a reversible reaction.\n\nAcetalisation is [[acid]] [[catalysis|catalysed]] with elimination of water; acetals do ''not'' form under [[base (chemistry)|basic]] conditions. The reaction can be driven to the acetal when water is removed from the reaction system either by [[azeotropic distillation]] or trapping water with [[molecular sieve]]s or [[aluminium oxide]].\n\nThe carbonyl group in '''1''' takes a proton from [[hydronium]]. The protonated carbonyl group 2 is activated for nucleophilic addition of the alcohol. The structures '''2a''' and '''2b''' are [[mesomer]]s. After [[deprotonation]] of '''3''' by water the [[hemiacetal]] or hemiketal '''4''' is formed. The hydroxyl group in '''4''' is protonated leading to the [[oxonium ion]] '''6''' which accepts a second alcohol group to '''7''' with a final deprotonation to the acetal '''8'''. The reverse reaction takes place by adding water in the same acidic medium. Acetals are stable towards basic media. In a transacetalisation or crossacetalisation a diol reacts with an acetal or two different acetals react with each other. Again this is possible because all the reaction steps are equilibria.\n[[File:Acetalisation.png|thumb|center|500px|Acetalisation mechanism]]\n\n==Examples==\n*[[benzylidene acetal]], a protecting group\n*[[Dimethoxymethane]], a solvent, a.k.a. methylal, a.k.a. formal [ambiguous]\n*[[Dioxolane]]\n*[[Metaldehyde]]\n*[[Paraldehyde]]\n*[[1,3,5-Trioxane]]\n*Phenylsulfonylethylidene (PSE) acetal is an example of arylsulfonyl acetal possessing atypical properties, like resistance to acid hydrolysis which leads to selective introduction and removal of the protective group.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ch\u00e9ry|first=Florence|last2=Rollin|first2=Patrick|last3=De Lucchi|first3=Ottorino|last4=Cossu|first4=Sergio|date=2000|title=Phenylsulfonylethylidene (PSE) acetals as atypical carbohydrate-protective groups|url=|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|volume=41|issue=14|pages=2357\u20132360|doi=10.1016/s0040-4039(00)00199-4|issn=0040-4039|via=}}</ref>\n*Most [[glycosidic bond]]s in [[carbohydrate]]s and other [[polysaccharide]]s are acetal linkages.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=glycosides|file=G02661}}</ref>\n**[[Cellulose]] is a ubiquitous example of a polyacetal.\nAlthough many compounds contain an acetal functional group, at least two acetal compounds are called \"acetal\" for short:\n*[[Polyoxymethylene]] (POM) plastic, also known as \"acetal\" or \"polyacetal\", is a polyacetal (and a polyether), and a polymer of [[formaldehyde]].\n*[[1,1-Diethoxyethane]] (acetaldehyde diethyl acetal), sometimes called simply \"acetal\", is an important flavouring compound in [[distilled beverage]]s.<ref>Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages, {{ISBN|0-8247-8390-5}}, https://books.google.com/books?id=_OvXjhLUz-oC, p.554</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aminal]], a.k.a. aminoacetal\n*[[Hemiaminal]]\n*[[Orthoformate]]\n*[[Thioacetal]]\n*[[Thioketal]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Acetals| ]]\n[[Category:Functional groups]]\n[[Category:Protecting groups]]\n", "text_old": "{{For2|the engineering plastic|[[polyoxymethylene]]|the flavor compound|[[1,1-Diethoxyethane|1,1-diethoxyethane]]}}\n{{distinguish|acetyl}}\n[[File:Acetal general structure.svg|thumb|Generic structure of acetals]]\nAn '''acetal''' is a [[functional group]] with the connectivity R<sub>2</sub>C(OR')<sub>2</sub>).
