About two thirds of Bessarabia lies within modern-day [[Moldova]], with the Ukrainian [[Budjak]] region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] covering a small area in the north.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]], and the ensuing [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Peace of Bucharest]], the eastern parts of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[vassal state|vassal]], along with some areas formerly under direct Ottoman rule, were ceded to [[Imperial Russia]]. The acquisition was among the Empire's last territorial acquisitions in Europe. The newly acquired territories were organised as the [[Bessarabia Governorate|Governorate of Bessarabia]], adopting a name previously used for the southern plains, between the Dniester and the [[Danube]] rivers. Following the [[Crimean War]], in 1856, the southern areas of Bessarabia were returned to Moldavian rule; Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878, when [[United Principalities|Romania]], the result of Moldavia's union with [[Wallachia]], was pressured into exchanging those territories for the [[Dobruja]].\n\nIn 1917, in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]], the area constituted itself as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], an autonomous republic part of a proposed [[Russian Democratic Federative Republic|federative Russian state]]. [[Bolshevik]] agitation in late 1917 and early 1918 resulted in the intervention of the [[Romanian Army]], ostensibly to pacify the region. Soon after, the parliamentary assembly declared independence, and then [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with the Kingdom of Romania]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Charles Upson |title=Bessarabia |url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/meta_pag.shtml |publisher=Dodd, Mead |location=New York City |year=1927}}</ref> The legality of these acts was however disputed, most prominently by the [[Soviet Union]], which regarded the area as a territory occupied by Romania.\n\nIn 1940, after securing the assent of Nazi Germany through the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union pressured Romania, under threat of war,<ref name=\"Rothschild77\">Joseph Rothschild, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytc-muwFT_IC&pg=PA314 East Central Europe between the two World Wars]'' University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1977; {{ISBN|0-295953-57-8}}, p.314</ref> into withdrawing from Bessarabia, allowing the [[Red Army]] to [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annex the region]]. The area was formally integrated into the Soviet Union: the core joined parts of the [[Moldavian ASSR]] to form the [[Moldavian SSR]], while territories inhabited by [[Slav]]ic majorities in the north and the south of Bessarabia were transferred to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-aligned Romania recaptured the region in 1941 with the success of [[Operation M\u00fcnchen]] during the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], but lost it in 1944 as the tide of war changed. In 1947, the Soviet-Romanian border along the Prut was internationally recognised by the Paris Treaty that ended [[World War II]].\n\nDuring the process of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Moldavian and Ukrainian SSRs proclaimed their independence in 1991, becoming the modern states of [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]], while preserving the existing partition of Bessarabia. Following a short war in the early 1990s, the [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]] was proclaimed in the [[Transnistria (geographical region)|Transnistria]], extending its authority also over the municipality of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] on the right bank of Dniester river. Part of the [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]]-inhabited areas in the southern Bessarabia was organised in 1994 as an [[Gagauzia|autonomous region]] within Moldova.\n\n== Etymology and usage of the name ==\n[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Map of Bessarabia within Moldavia through time]]\n\nAccording to the traditional explanation, the name Bessarabia (''Basarabia'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) derives from the [[Wallachia]]n [[Basarab dynasty]], who allegedly ruled over the southern part of the area in the 14th century. Some scholars question this, however, claiming that:\n* the name was initially an [[exonym]] applied by [[Western Europe|Western]] cartographers\n* it was first used in local sources only in the late 17th century;\n* the idea that it referred to Moldavian regions near the [[Black Sea]] was explicitly rejected as a cartographic confusion by the early Moldavian chronicler [[Miron Costin]], and;\n* the confusion may have been caused by medieval Western cartographers, misinterpreting  contemporaneous Polish  references to Wallachia as ''Bessarabia'', as referring to a separate land between Wallachia and Moldavia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coman| first=Marian|title=Basarabia \u2013 Inventarea cartografic\u0103 a unei regiuni|journal=Studii \u0219i Materiale de Istorie Medie| volume=XXIX| pages=183\u2013215|year=2011| publisher= [[Institutul de Istorie Nicolae Iorga]]| issn=1222-4766}}\n</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the name Bessarabia originally applied only to the part of the territory south of the [[Upper Trajan Wall|Upper Trajanic Wall]], i.e. an area only slightly bigger than present-day [[Budjak]].\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region is bounded by the Dniester to the north and east, the [[Prut]] to the west, and the lower [[River Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the south.

After his death, the polity was divided into smaller pieces, and the central parts were unified in the Dacian kingdom of [[Decebalus]] in the 1st century AD. This kingdom was defeated by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106. Southern Bessarabia was included in the empire even before that, in 57 AD, as part of the Roman province [[Moesia Inferior]], but it was secured only when the Dacian Kingdom was defeated in 106. The Romans built defensive earthen walls in Southern Bessarabia (e.g. [[Lower Trajan Wall]]) to defend the [[Scythia Minor]] province against invasions. Except for the [[Black Sea]] shore in the south, Bessarabia remained outside direct Roman control; the myriad of tribes there are called by modern historians [[Free Dacians]].<ref>Mihai B\u0103rbulescu, Dennis Diletant, Keith Hitchins, \u0218erban Papacostea, Pompiliu Teodor, \"Istoria Rom\u00e2niei\", Corint, Bucharest, 2007, {{ISBN|978-973-135-031-8}}, pag. 77</ref> The 2nd to the 5th centuries also saw the development of the [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\nIn 270, the Roman authorities began to withdraw their forces south of the Danube, especially from the [[Roman Dacia]], due to the invading [[Goths]] and Carpi. The [[Goths]], a Germanic tribe, poured into the [[Roman Empire]] from the lower [[Dniepr River]], through the southern part of Bessarabia ([[Budjak|Budjak steppe]]), which due to its geographic position and characteristics (mainly [[steppe]]), was swept by various nomadic tribes for many centuries. In 378, the area was overrun by the [[Huns]].\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n{{Main article|Moldavia in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Origin of the Romanians}}\n\n[[File:Tara Rumaneasca map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|According to one theory, the region's name originated from the Wallachian rule during the late 14th century (1390 map).]]\n\nFrom the 3rd century until the 11th century, the region was invaded numerous times in turn by different tribes: [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Mongols]]. The territory of Bessarabia was encompassed in dozens of ephemeral kingdoms which were disbanded when another wave of migrants arrived. Those centuries were characterized by a terrible state of insecurity and mass movement of these tribes. The period was later known as the ''\"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\"'' of Europe, or Age of migrations.\n\nIn 561, the Avars captured Bessarabia and executed the local ruler [[Mesamer]]. Following the Avars, Slavs started to arrive in the region and establish settlements. Then, in 582, [[Onogurs|Onogur]] Bulgars settled in southeastern Bessarabia and northern [[Dobruja]], from which they moved to Moesia Inferior (allegedly under pressure from the [[Khazars]]), and formed the nascent region of ''Bulgaria''. With the rise of the Khazars' state in the east, the invasions began to diminish and it was possible to create larger states. According to some opinions, the southern part of Bessarabia remained under the influence of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] until to the end of the 9th century.\n\nBetween the 8th and 10th centuries, the southern part of Bessarabia was inhabited by people from the [[Balkan-Danubian culture]]<ref>\u0427\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u0413.\u0424. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u043a \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 VIII-\u0425 \u0432\u0432. \u044e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e-\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c\u044f//\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0438, \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0432, 1969, \u0441. 224\u2013230</ref> (the culture of the First Bulgarian Empire). Between the 9th and 13th centuries, Bessarabia is mentioned in Slav chronicles as part of ''Bolohoveni'' (north) and ''[[Brodnici]]'' (south) voivodeships, believed{{by whom|date=February 2012}} to be [[Vlach]] principalities of the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe last large scale invasions were those of the [[Mongols]] of 1241, 1290, and 1343. Sehr al-Jedid (near [[Orhei]]), an important settlement of the [[Golden Horde]], dates from this period. They led to a retreat of a big part of the population to the mountainous areas in [[Eastern Carpathians]] and to [[Transylvania]]. The population east of Prut became especially low at the time of the Tatar invasions.\n\nIn the Late Middle Age, chronicles mention a [[Tigheci]] \"republic\", predating the establishment of the [[Principality of Moldavia]], situated near the modern town of [[Cahul]] in the southwest of Bessarabia, preserving its autonomy even during the later Principality even into the 18th century. [[Republic of Genoa|Genovese]] merchants rebuilt or established a number of forts along Dniester (notably [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Moncastro]]) and Danube (including [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Kyliya/Chilia]]-[[Chilia Veche|Licostomo]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n=== Principality of Moldavia ===\n{{Main article|History of Moldavia}}\n[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|Most of Bessarabia was for centuries part of the principality of Moldavia (1800 map).]]\n\nAfter the 1360s the region was gradually included in the [[principality]] of [[Moldavia]], which by 1392 established control over the fortresses of [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Akkerman]] and [[Kilia, Ukraine|Chilia]], its eastern border becoming the [[Dniester|River Dniester]]. Based on the name of the region, some authors consider that in the latter part of the 14th century the southern part of the region was under the rule of [[Wallachia]] (the ruling dynasty of Wallachia during that period was called [[House of Basarab|Basarab]]). In the 15th century, the entire region was a part of the principality of Moldavia. [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] ruled between 1457 and 1504, a period of nearly 50 years during which he won 32 battles defending his country against virtually all his neighbours (mainly the Ottomans and the Tatars, but also the Hungarians and the Poles), while losing only two. During this period, after each victory, he raised a monastery or a church close to the battlefield honoring Christianity. Many of these battlefields and churches, as well as old fortresses, are situated in Bessarabia (mainly along Dniester).\n\n[[File:\u0410\u043a\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0446\u044f \u0432 \u0411\u0456\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434-\u0414\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044311.jpg|thumb|Akkerman fortress in [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]], [[Ukraine]]) was one of the many important castles in Bessarabia.]]\n\nIn 1484, the Turks invaded and captured Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103 (Akkerman in Turkish), and annexed the shoreline southern part of Bessarabia, which was then divided into two [[sanjak]]s (districts) of the Ottoman Empire. In 1538, the Ottomans annexed more Bessarabian land in the south as far as [[Tighina]], while the central and northern Bessarabia remained part of the Principality of Moldavia (which became a [[vassal]] of the Ottoman Empire).

After the victory of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] in the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Ukrainian SSR]] was created in 1922, and in 1924 the [[Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established on a strip of Ukrainian land on the west bank of Dniester where Moldovans and Romanians accounted for less than a third and the relative majority of population was [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]. (See [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic#Demographics|Demographics of Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]).\n\nAccording to Vladimir Solonar and Vladimir Bruter, Bessarabia under Romanian rule experienced low population growth due to high mortality (one of the highest in Europe) as well as emigration; Bessarabia was also characterized by economic stagnation and high unemployment.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Shlapentokh |editor1-first=Vladimir |editor2-last=Sendich |editor2-first=Munir |editor3-last=Payin |editor3-first=Emil |title=The New Russian diaspora : Russian Minorities in the former Soviet Republics |chapter=Russians in Moldova |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |orig-year=1st pub.

As a consequence, even Bessarabian entrepreneurs preferred to invest their capital in those areas instead of using it within the region. Local industry faced fierce competition from larger Romanian companies, which had access to preferential rail tariffs, limited credit to local entrepreneurs and flooded the local market with cheaper industrial goods produced in Romania or imported from abroad. Nevertheless, some new small-scale industrial enterprises were established in the 1920s, using primarily local raw materials and producing for the local market. The total engine power rose from 7.8 thousand [[Horsepower|hp]] in 1925 to 12.2 thousand in 1929. Nevertheless, many of the enterprises did not survive for long, and the [[Great Depression]] had particularly strong impact on the region, many of the companies going bankrupt or closing in 1929-1933. Governmental policy, influenced by the banking system and the industrial cartels, prevented a rebound, the industry of the ''[[Old Kingdom]]'' again receiving preferential treatment. The main factors that affected the development of Bessarabia in the 1930s were severe credit restrictions, increase in transport tariffs and customs restrictions and special tax policies. Bessarabia was reduced mostly to a supplier of raw materials, and a market for the cheaper industrial goods of Romanian or foreign origin. By the end of the 1930s, the only industrial sectors that managed to rebound were the food and woodworking industries, the rest witnessing either stagnation or a decrease compared to pre-depression levels. Even so, most industrial facilities in the food industry worked significantly bellow their installed capacity even in prosperous years such as 1937. Several large factories, such as the [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]] railway workshops, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u textile and knitwear factories, and the [[Flore\u0219ti, Moldova|Flore\u0219ti]] workshops were dismantled and relocated to the ''Old Kingdom'' during 1935-1938. Between 1929 and 1937, fixed capital in the industry dropped by 10%, and the number of industrial workers in Bessarabia dropped from 5,400 in 1925 to 3,500 in 1937, while their overall number in Romania had increased by almost 27%. Between 1926 and 1937 the share of the food industry in the total production of large manufacturing industries increased from 77.1% to 92.4%, with sharp decreases observed in sectors with higher added value, such as the metalworking, textile and leather processing industries. Even so, the food industry failed to fulfill local needs, while most industries heavily relied on manual labor and primitive technologies. Electricity production in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia's center and Romania's second largest city, recorded in 1925 at 4.47 million kWh, only increased by 6.7%, during the following decade, lagging far behind other Romanian cities: 572.3% in [[Gala\u021bi]], 238.2% in Bucharest, and over 101% in Ia\u0219i. In a 1938 review, the Bessarabian Federation of Chambers of Commerce noted that \"the decline in industrial production in Bessarabia hinders the rational processing of local raw materials, thereby turning our province into a colony for industry in the rest of the country\". Throughout the period, industrial workers in the region faced long working hours (up to fourteen per day), lack proper safety precaution, unsanitary conditions, the perspective of unemployment and general decrease in the standard of living: the real wage of a Chi\u0219in\u0103u worker dropped 60% between 1913 and 1937.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tsaranov |first1=V.

Bessarabia was divided between the Moldavian SSR (65% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (now [[Budjak]] and parts of the [[Chernivtsi oblast]]) were allotted to Ukraine, while some territories (4,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) on the left (eastern) bank of Dniester (present [[Transnistria]]), previously part of Ukraine, were allotted to Moldavia. Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians, who were accused of supporting the deposed Romanian administration, were executed or deported to [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nBetween September and November 1940, the [[Bessarabia Germans|ethnic Germans of Bessarabia]] were offered resettlement to Germany, following a German-Soviet agreement. Fearing Soviet oppression, almost all Germans (93,000) agreed. Most of them were resettled to the newly annexed Polish territories.\n\nOn June 22, 1941 the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] invasion of the Soviet Union commenced with [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Between June 22 and July 26, 1941, Romanian troops with the help of [[Wehrmacht]] recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. The Soviets employed [[scorched earth]] tactics during their forced retreat from Bessarabia, destroying the infrastructure and transporting movable goods to Russia by railway. At the end of July, after a year of Soviet rule, the region was once again under Romanian control.\n\nAs the military operation was still in progress, there were cases of Romanian troops \"taking revenge\" on Jews in Bessarabia, in the form of [[pogrom]]s on civilians and murder of Jewish [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], resulting in several thousand dead. The supposed cause for murdering Jews was that in 1940 some Jews welcomed the Soviet takeover as liberation. At the same time the notorious [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]], operating in the area of the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 11th Army]], committed summary executions of Jews under the pretext that they were spies, [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Communism|Communists]], or under no pretext whatsoever.\n\nThe political solution of the \"[[Jewish Question]]\" was apparently seen by the Romanian [[dictator]] Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] more in expulsion rather than extermination. That portion of the Jewish population of Bessarabia and Bukovina which did not flee before the retreat of the Soviet troops (147,000) was initially gathered into [[ghettos]] or [[Nazi concentration camps]], and then deported during 1941\u20131942 in [[death march]]es into [[Transnistria (World War II)|Romanian-occupied Transnistria]], where the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was applied.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/499496/Constructing_Interethnic_Conflict_and_Cooperation_Why_Some_People_Harmed_Jews_and_Others_Helped_Them_during_the_Holocaust_in_Romania|title=Constructing Interethnic Conflict and Cooperation: Why Some People Harmed Jews and Others Helped Them during the Holocaust in Romania Diana Dumitru|journal=World Politics |date=January 2011 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201342 |accessdate=2014-10-19 |doi=10.1017/s0043887110000274}}</ref>\n\nAfter three years of relative peace, the German-Soviet front returned in 1944 to the land border on the [[Dniester]].

The Soviet armies overran Bessarabia in a two-pronged offensive within five days. In pocket battles at [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] and [[Sarata, Odessa|S\u0103rata]] the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 6th Army]] of c. 650,000 men, newly reformed after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], was obliterated.

About two thirds of Bessarabia lies within modern-day [[Moldova]], with the Ukrainian [[Budjak]] region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] covering a small area in the north.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]], and the ensuing [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Peace of Bucharest]], the eastern parts of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[vassal state|vassal]], along with some areas formerly under direct Ottoman rule, were ceded to [[Imperial Russia]]. The acquisition was among the Empire's last territorial acquisitions in Europe. The newly acquired territories were organised as the [[Bessarabia Governorate|Governorate of Bessarabia]], adopting a name previously used for the southern plains, between the Dniester and the [[Danube]] rivers. Following the [[Crimean War]], in 1856, the southern areas of Bessarabia were returned to Moldavian rule; Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878, when [[United Principalities|Romania]], the result of Moldavia's union with [[Wallachia]], was pressured into exchanging those territories for the [[Dobruja]].\n\nIn 1917, in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]], the area constituted itself as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], an autonomous republic part of a proposed [[Russian Democratic Federative Republic|federative Russian state]]. [[Bolshevik]] agitation in late 1917 and early 1918 resulted in the intervention of the [[Romanian Army]], ostensibly to pacify the region. Soon after, the parliamentary assembly declared independence, and then [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with the Kingdom of Romania]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Charles Upson |title=Bessarabia |url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/meta_pag.shtml |publisher=Dodd, Mead |location=New York City |year=1927}}</ref> The legality of these acts was however disputed, most prominently by the [[Soviet Union]], which regarded the area as a territory occupied by Romania.\n\nIn 1940, after securing the assent of Nazi Germany through the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union pressured Romania, under threat of war,<ref name=\"Rothschild77\">Joseph Rothschild, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytc-muwFT_IC&pg=PA314 East Central Europe between the two World Wars]'' University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1977; {{ISBN|0-295953-57-8}}, p.314</ref> into withdrawing from Bessarabia, allowing the [[Red Army]] to [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annex the region]]. The area was formally integrated into the Soviet Union: the core joined parts of the [[Moldavian ASSR]] to form the [[Moldavian SSR]], while territories inhabited by [[Slav]]ic majorities in the north and the south of Bessarabia were transferred to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-aligned Romania recaptured the region in 1941 with the success of [[Operation M\u00fcnchen]] during the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], but lost it in 1944 as the tide of war changed. In 1947, the Soviet-Romanian border along the Prut was internationally recognised by the Paris Treaty that ended [[World War II]].\n\nDuring the process of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Moldavian and Ukrainian SSRs proclaimed their independence in 1991, becoming the modern states of [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]], while preserving the existing partition of Bessarabia. Following a short war in the early 1990s, the [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]] was proclaimed in the [[Transnistria (geographical region)|Transnistria]], extending its authority also over the municipality of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] on the right bank of Dniester river. Part of the [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]]-inhabited areas in the southern Bessarabia was organised in 1994 as an [[Gagauzia|autonomous region]] within Moldova.\n\n== Etymology and usage of the name ==\n[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Map of Bessarabia within Moldavia through time]]\n\nAccording to the traditional explanation, the name Bessarabia (''Basarabia'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) derives from the [[Wallachia]]n [[Basarab dynasty]], who allegedly ruled over the southern part of the area in the 14th century. Some scholars question this, however, claiming that:\n* the name was initially an [[exonym]] applied by [[Western Europe|Western]] cartographers\n* it was first used in local sources only in the late 17th century;\n* the idea that it referred to Moldavian regions near the [[Black Sea]] was explicitly rejected as a cartographic confusion by the early Moldavian chronicler [[Miron Costin]], and;\n* the confusion may have been caused by medieval Western cartographers, misinterpreting  contemporaneous Polish  references to Wallachia as ''Bessarabia'', as referring to a separate land between Wallachia and Moldavia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coman| first=Marian|title=Basarabia \u2013 Inventarea cartografic\u0103 a unei regiuni|journal=Studii \u0219i Materiale de Istorie Medie| volume=XXIX| pages=183\u2013215|year=2011| publisher= [[Institutul de Istorie Nicolae Iorga]]| issn=1222-4766}}\n</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the name Bessarabia originally applied only to the part of the territory south of the [[Upper Trajan Wall|Upper Trajanic Wall]], i.e. an area only slightly bigger than present-day [[Budjak]].\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region is bounded by the Dniester to the north and east, the [[Prut]] to the west, and the lower [[River Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the south.

It is very fertile and has [[lignite]] deposits and stone quarries. People living in the area grow [[sugar beet]], [[sunflower]], [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[tobacco]], [[wine grapes]], and [[fruit]]. They raise [[sheep]] and [[cattle]]. The main industry in the region is agricultural processing.\n\nThe main cities are [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] (former capital of Bessarabia Governorate, now capital of Moldova), and [[Izmail]] and [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovs'kyi]] (historically called Cetatea Alb\u0103 and Akkerman; both now within Ukraine).

Afterwards, this territory was directly or indirectly, partly or wholly controlled by: the [[Ottoman Empire]] (as suzerain of Moldavia, with direct rule only in Budjak and [[Khotin]]), [[Russian Empire]], [[Romania]], the [[USSR]]. Since 1991, most of the territory forms the core of [[Moldova]], with smaller parts in [[Ukraine]].\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main article|Prehistory of Moldavia|Bronze Age in Romania}}\n\nThe territory of Bessarabia has been inhabited by people for thousands of years.

[[Celts]] also settled in the southern parts of Bessarabia, their main city being Aliobrix.\n\nThe first polity that is believed to have included the whole of Bessarabia was the [[Dacia]]n polity of [[Burebista]] in the 1st century BC. After his death, the polity was divided into smaller pieces, and the central parts were unified in the Dacian kingdom of [[Decebalus]] in the 1st century AD. This kingdom was defeated by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106. Southern Bessarabia was included in the empire even before that, in 57 AD, as part of the Roman province [[Moesia Inferior]], but it was secured only when the Dacian Kingdom was defeated in 106. The Romans built defensive earthen walls in Southern Bessarabia (e.g. [[Lower Trajan Wall]]) to defend the [[Scythia Minor]] province against invasions. Except for the [[Black Sea]] shore in the south, Bessarabia remained outside direct Roman control; the myriad of tribes there are called by modern historians [[Free Dacians]].<ref>Mihai B\u0103rbulescu, Dennis Diletant, Keith Hitchins, \u0218erban Papacostea, Pompiliu Teodor, \"Istoria Rom\u00e2niei\", Corint, Bucharest, 2007, {{ISBN|978-973-135-031-8}}, pag. 77</ref> The 2nd to the 5th centuries also saw the development of the [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\nIn 270, the Roman authorities began to withdraw their forces south of the Danube, especially from the [[Roman Dacia]], due to the invading [[Goths]] and Carpi. The [[Goths]], a Germanic tribe, poured into the [[Roman Empire]] from the lower [[Dniepr River]], through the southern part of Bessarabia ([[Budjak|Budjak steppe]]), which due to its geographic position and characteristics (mainly [[steppe]]), was swept by various nomadic tribes for many centuries. In 378, the area was overrun by the [[Huns]].\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n{{Main article|Moldavia in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Origin of the Romanians}}\n\n[[File:Tara Rumaneasca map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|According to one theory, the region's name originated from the Wallachian rule during the late 14th century (1390 map).]]\n\nFrom the 3rd century until the 11th century, the region was invaded numerous times in turn by different tribes: [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Mongols]]. The territory of Bessarabia was encompassed in dozens of ephemeral kingdoms which were disbanded when another wave of migrants arrived. Those centuries were characterized by a terrible state of insecurity and mass movement of these tribes. The period was later known as the ''\"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\"'' of Europe, or Age of migrations.\n\nIn 561, the Avars captured Bessarabia and executed the local ruler [[Mesamer]]. Following the Avars, Slavs started to arrive in the region and establish settlements. Then, in 582, [[Onogurs|Onogur]] Bulgars settled in southeastern Bessarabia and northern [[Dobruja]], from which they moved to Moesia Inferior (allegedly under pressure from the [[Khazars]]), and formed the nascent region of ''Bulgaria''. With the rise of the Khazars' state in the east, the invasions began to diminish and it was possible to create larger states. According to some opinions, the southern part of Bessarabia remained under the influence of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] until to the end of the 9th century.\n\nBetween the 8th and 10th centuries, the southern part of Bessarabia was inhabited by people from the [[Balkan-Danubian culture]]<ref>\u0427\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u0413.\u0424. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u043a \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 VIII-\u0425 \u0432\u0432. \u044e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e-\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c\u044f//\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0438, \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0432, 1969, \u0441. 224\u2013230</ref> (the culture of the First Bulgarian Empire). Between the 9th and 13th centuries, Bessarabia is mentioned in Slav chronicles as part of ''Bolohoveni'' (north) and ''[[Brodnici]]'' (south) voivodeships, believed{{by whom|date=February 2012}} to be [[Vlach]] principalities of the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe last large scale invasions were those of the [[Mongols]] of 1241, 1290, and 1343. Sehr al-Jedid (near [[Orhei]]), an important settlement of the [[Golden Horde]], dates from this period. They led to a retreat of a big part of the population to the mountainous areas in [[Eastern Carpathians]] and to [[Transylvania]]. The population east of Prut became especially low at the time of the Tatar invasions.\n\nIn the Late Middle Age, chronicles mention a [[Tigheci]] \"republic\", predating the establishment of the [[Principality of Moldavia]], situated near the modern town of [[Cahul]] in the southwest of Bessarabia, preserving its autonomy even during the later Principality even into the 18th century. [[Republic of Genoa|Genovese]] merchants rebuilt or established a number of forts along Dniester (notably [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Moncastro]]) and Danube (including [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Kyliya/Chilia]]-[[Chilia Veche|Licostomo]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n=== Principality of Moldavia ===\n{{Main article|History of Moldavia}}\n[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|Most of Bessarabia was for centuries part of the principality of Moldavia (1800 map).]]\n\nAfter the 1360s the region was gradually included in the [[principality]] of [[Moldavia]], which by 1392 established control over the fortresses of [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Akkerman]] and [[Kilia, Ukraine|Chilia]], its eastern border becoming the [[Dniester|River Dniester]]. Based on the name of the region, some authors consider that in the latter part of the 14th century the southern part of the region was under the rule of [[Wallachia]] (the ruling dynasty of Wallachia during that period was called [[House of Basarab|Basarab]]). In the 15th century, the entire region was a part of the principality of Moldavia. [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] ruled between 1457 and 1504, a period of nearly 50 years during which he won 32 battles defending his country against virtually all his neighbours (mainly the Ottomans and the Tatars, but also the Hungarians and the Poles), while losing only two. During this period, after each victory, he raised a monastery or a church close to the battlefield honoring Christianity. Many of these battlefields and churches, as well as old fortresses, are situated in Bessarabia (mainly along Dniester).\n\n[[File:\u0410\u043a\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0446\u044f \u0432 \u0411\u0456\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434-\u0414\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044311.jpg|thumb|Akkerman fortress in [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]], [[Ukraine]]) was one of the many important castles in Bessarabia.]]\n\nIn 1484, the Turks invaded and captured Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103 (Akkerman in Turkish), and annexed the shoreline southern part of Bessarabia, which was then divided into two [[sanjak]]s (districts) of the Ottoman Empire.

As a consequence, even Bessarabian entrepreneurs preferred to invest their capital in those areas instead of using within the region. Local industry faced fierce competition from larger Romanian companies, which had access to preferential rail tariffs, limited credit to local entrepreneurs and flooded the local market with cheaper industrial goods produced in Romania or imported from abroad. Nevertheless, some new small-scale industrial enterprises were established in the 1920s, using primarily local raw materials and producing for the local market. The total engine power rose from 7.8 thousand [[Horsepower|hp]] in 1925 to 12.2 thousand in 1929. Nevertheless, many of the enterprises did not survive for long, and the [[Great Depression]] had particularly strong impact on the region, many of the companies going bankrupt or closing in 1929-1933. Governmental policy, influenced by the banking system and the industrial cartels, prevented a rebound, the industry of the ''[[Old Kingdom]]'' again receiving preferential treatment. The main factors that affected the development of Bessarabia in the 1930s were severe credit restrictions, increase in transport tariffs and customs restrictions and special tax policies. Bessarabia was reduced mostly to a supplier of raw materials, and a market for the cheaper industrial goods of Romanian or foreign origin. By the end of the 1930s, the only industrial sectors that managed to rebound were the food and woodworking industries, the rest witnessing either stagnation or a decrease compared to pre-depression levels. Even so, most industrial facilities in the food industry worked significantly bellow their installed capacity even in prosperous years such as 1937. Several large factories, such as the [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]] railway workshops, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u textile and knitwear factories, and the [[Flore\u0219ti, Moldova|Flore\u0219ti]] workshops were dismantled and relocated to the ''Old Kingdom'' during 1935-1938. Between 1929 and 1937, fixed capital in the industry dropped by 10%, and the number of industrial workers in Bessarabia dropped from 5,400 in 1925 to 3,500 in 1937, while their overall number in Romania had increased by almost 27%. Between 1926 and 1937 the share of the food industry in the total production of large manufacturing industries increased from 77.1% to 92.4%, with sharp decreases observed in sectors with higher added value, such as the metalworking, textile and leather processing industries. Even so, the food industry failed to fulfill local needs, while most industries heavily relied on manual labor and primitive technologies. Electricity production in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia's center and Romania's second largest city, recorded in 1925 at 4.47 million kWh, only increased by 6.7%, during the following decade, lagging far behind other Romanian cities: 572.3% in [[Gala\u021bi]], 238.2% in Bucharest, and over 101% in Ia\u0219i. In a 1938 review, the Bessarabian Federation of Chambers of Commerce noted that \"the decline in industrial production in Bessarabia hinders the rational processing of local raw materials, thereby turning our province into a colony for industry in the rest of the country\". Throughout the period, industrial workers in the region faced long working hours (up to fourteen per day), lack proper safety precaution, unsanitary conditions, the perspective of unemployment and general decrease in the standard of living: the real wage of a Chi\u0219in\u0103u worker dropped 60% between 1913 and 1937.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tsaranov |first1=V.

Bessarabia was divided between the Moldavian SSR (65% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (now [[Budjak]] and parts of the [[Chernivtsi oblast]]) were allotted to Ukraine, while some territories (4,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) on the left (eastern) bank of Dniester (present [[Transnistria]]), previously part of Ukraine, were allotted to Moldavia. Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians, who were accused of supporting the deposed Romanian administration, were executed or deported to [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nBetween September and November 1940, the [[Bessarabia Germans|ethnic Germans of Bessarabia]] were offered resettlement to Germany, following a German-Soviet agreement. Fearing Soviet oppression, almost all Germans (93,000) agreed. Most of them were resettled to the newly annexed Polish territories.\n\nOn June 22, 1941 the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] invasion of the Soviet Union commenced with [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Between June 22 and July 26, 1941, Romanian troops with the help of [[Wehrmacht]] recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. The Soviets employed [[scorched earth]] tactics during their forced retreat from Bessarabia, destroying the infrastructure and transporting movable goods to Russia by railway. At the end of July, after a year of Soviet rule, the region was once again under Romanian control.\n\nAs the military operation was still in progress, there were cases of Romanian troops \"taking revenge\" on Jews in Bessarabia, in the form of [[pogrom]]s on civilians and murder of Jewish [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], resulting in several thousand dead. The supposed cause for murdering Jews was that in 1940 some Jews welcomed the Soviet takeover as liberation. At the same time the notorious [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]], operating in the area of the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 11th Army]], committed summary executions of Jews under the pretext that they were spies, [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Communism|Communists]], or under no pretext whatsoever.\n\nThe political solution of the \"[[Jewish Question]]\" was apparently seen by the Romanian [[dictator]] Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] more in expulsion rather than extermination. That portion of the Jewish population of Bessarabia and Bukovina which did not flee before the retreat of the Soviet troops (147,000) was initially gathered into [[ghettos]] or [[Nazi concentration camps]], and then deported during 1941\u20131942 in [[death march]]es into [[Transnistria (World War II)|Romanian-occupied Transnistria]], where the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was applied.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/499496/Constructing_Interethnic_Conflict_and_Cooperation_Why_Some_People_Harmed_Jews_and_Others_Helped_Them_during_the_Holocaust_in_Romania|title=Constructing Interethnic Conflict and Cooperation: Why Some People Harmed Jews and Others Helped Them during the Holocaust in Romania Diana Dumitru|journal=World Politics |date=January 2011 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201342 |accessdate=2014-10-19 |doi=10.1017/s0043887110000274}}</ref>\n\nAfter three years of relative peace, the German-Soviet front returned in 1944 to the land border on the [[Dniester]].

On August 23, 1944, Marshal Ion Antonescu was arrested by King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]], and later handed over to the Soviets.\n\n=== Part of the Soviet Union ===\n{{Main article|Moldovan SSR}}\n\n[[File:Soviet Union - Moldavian SSR.svg|250px|thumb|Moldavian SSR (in red) as part of the [[Soviet Union]] (yellow)]]\nThe Soviet Union regained the region in 1944, and the Red Army occupied Romania. By 1947, the Soviets had imposed a [[Communist Romania|communist government]] in Bucharest, which was friendly and obedient towards Moscow. The [[Soviet occupation of Romania]] lasted until 1958.  The Romanian communist regime did not openly raise the matter of Bessarabia or Northern Bukovina in its diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. At least 100,000 people died in a post-war famine in Moldavia.\n\nBetween 1969  and 1971, a clandestine National Patriotic Front was established by several young intellectuals in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, totaling over 100 members, vowing to fight for the establishment of a Moldavian Democratic Republic, its secession from the Soviet Union and union with Romania.\n\nIn December 1971, following an informative note from [[Ion Stanescu|Ion St\u0103nescu]], the President of the Council of State Security of the Romanian Socialist Republic, to [[Yuri Andropov]], the chief of KGB, three of the leaders of the [[National Patriotic Front (Moldova)|National Patriotic Front]], [[Alexandru Usatiuc-Bulgar]], [[Gheorghe Ghimpu]] and [[Valeriu Graur]], as well as a fourth person, [[Alexandru Soltoianu]], the leader of a similar clandestine movement in northern [[Bukovina]] (Bucovina), were arrested and later sentenced to long prison terms.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/4921186/Political_Repressions_in_the_Moldavian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_after_1956_Towards_a_Typology_Based_on_KGB_files |title=Political Repressions in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic after 1956: Towards a Typology Based on KGB files Igor Casu |journal=Dystopia |volume=I |issue=1\u20132 |year=2014 |pages= 89\u2013127 |accessdate=2014-10-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise of independent Moldova ===\n{{Main article|Moldovan SSR|Moldova|History of Moldova}}\n\nWith the weakening of the Soviet Union, in February 1988, the first non-sanctioned demonstrations were held in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]]. At first pro-[[Perestroika]], they soon turned anti-government and demanded official status for the Romanian (Moldavian) language instead of the Russian language.  On August 31, 1989, following a 600,000-strong demonstration in Chi\u0219in\u0103u four days earlier, Romanian (Moldavian) became the official language of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. However, this was not implemented for many years.  In 1990, the first free elections were held for Parliament, with the opposition [[Popular Front of Moldova|Popular Front]] winning them. A government led by [[Mircea Druc]], one of the leaders of the Popular Front, was formed. The Moldavian SSR became SSR Moldova, and later the Republic of Moldova.  The [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] became independent on August 31, 1991; it took over unchanged the boundaries of the Moldavian SSR.\n\n== Population ==\nAccording to Bessarabian historian [[\u0218tefan Ciobanu]] and Moldovan philologist Viorica R\u0103ileanu, in '''1810''' the percentage of the Romanian (Moldavian) population was approximately 95%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ciobanu|first=\u0218tefan|title=Cultura rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 \u00een Basarabia sub st\u0103p\u00e2nirea rus\u0103|year=1923|publisher=Editura Asocia\u021biei Uniunea Cultural\u0103 Bisericeasc\u0103|location=Chi\u0219in\u0103u|page=20}}</ref><ref>[http://www.upm.ro/cci12/volCCI_II/Pages%20from%20Volum_texteCCI2-134.pdf The Memory of (Im)Proper Names from Basarabia]</ref> During the 19th century, as a result of the Russian policy of colonization and [[Russification]],<ref name=\"Mitrasca2007\">{{cite book|author=Marcel Mitrasca|title=Moldova: A Romanian Province Under Russian Rule : Diplomatic History from the Archives of the Great Powers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nYrAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA20|year=2007|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=978-0-87586-184-5|pages=20\u2013}}</ref> the Romanian population decreased to (depending on data sources) 47.6% (in 1897), 52% or 75% for 1900 (Krusevan), 53.9% (1907), 70% (1912, Laskov), or 65\u201367% (1918, J.
