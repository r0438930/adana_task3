Numerous molluscs also live in [[freshwater mollusc|freshwater]] and [[Terrestrial molluscs|terrestrial]] [[habitat]]s. They are highly diverse, not just in size and  [[anatomical]] structure, but also in behaviour and  habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 8 or 9&nbsp;[[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[class (biology)|classes]], of which two are entirely [[extinct]]. [[Cephalopod]] molluscs, such as [[squid]], [[cuttlefish]], and [[octopus]]es, are among the most [[neurobiology|neurologically advanced]] of all [[invertebrate]]s\u2014and either the [[giant squid]] or the [[colossal squid]] is the largest known invertebrate species. The [[gastropod]]s ([[snail]]s and [[slug]]s) are by far the most numerous molluscs and account for 80% of the total classified species.\n\nThe three most universal features defining modern molluscs are a [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] with a significant cavity used for breathing and [[excretion]], the presence of a [[radula]] (except for [[bivalves]]), and the structure of the [[nervous system]]. Other than these common elements, molluscs express great morphological diversity, so many textbooks base their descriptions on a \"hypothetical ancestral mollusc\" (see image below). This has a single, \"[[limpet]]-like\" [[gastropod shell|shell]] on top, which is made of [[protein]]s and [[chitin]] reinforced with [[calcium carbonate]], and is secreted by a mantle covering the whole upper surface. The underside of the animal consists of a single muscular \"foot\". Although molluscs are [[coelomate]]s, the [[coelom]] tends to be small.\nThe main body cavity is a [[hemocoel]] through which [[blood]] circulates; as such, their [[circulatory system]]s are mainly [[Open circulatory system|open]]. The \"generalized\" mollusc's feeding system consists of a rasping \"tongue\", the radula, and a complex digestive system in which exuded [[mucus]] and microscopic, muscle-powered \"hairs\" called [[cilia]] play various important roles. The generalized mollusc has two paired [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]], or three in [[bivalve]]s. The [[brain]], in species that have one, encircles the [[esophagus]]. Most molluscs have [[eyes]], and all have sensors to detect chemicals, vibrations, and touch. The simplest type of molluscan [[reproductive system]] relies on [[external fertilization]], but more complex variations occur. Nearly all produce [[egg (biology)|eggs]], from which may emerge [[trochophore]] [[larvae]], more complex [[veliger]] larvae, or miniature adults. The coelomic  cavity is reduced. They have an open circulatory system and kidney-like organs for excretion.\n\nGood evidence exists for the appearance of gastropods, [[cephalopod]]s, and bivalves in the [[Cambrian]] period, 541\u2013485.4&nbsp;million years ago. However, the evolutionary history both of molluscs' emergence from the ancestral [[Lophotrochozoa]] and of their diversification into the well-known living and [[fossil]] forms are still subjects of vigorous debate among scientists.\n[[File:Fossilized_Ammonite_Mollusk_displayed_at_Philippine_National_Museum.jpg|thumb|Fossilized ammonite displayed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]]]\nMolluscs have been and still are an important food source for [[anatomically modern human]]s. A risk of food poisoning exists from toxins that can accumulate in certain molluscs under specific conditions, however, and because of this, many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably [[pearl]]s, [[mother of pearl]], [[Tyrian purple]] dye, and [[sea silk]]. Their shells have also been [[Shell money|used]] as [[money]] in some preindustrial societies.\n\nMollusc species can also represent hazards or pests for human activities. The bite of the [[blue-ringed octopus]] is often fatal, and that of ''[[Octopus apollyon]]'' causes [[inflammation]] that can last over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical [[cone shell]]s can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in [[neurological]] research. [[Schistosomiasis]] (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis, or snail fever) is transmitted to humans by water snail hosts, and affects about 200&nbsp;million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some [[ecosystem]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe words [[wikt:mollusc|mollusc]] and mollusk are both derived from the French ''mollusque'', which originated from the [[Latin]] ''molluscus'', from ''[[wikt:mollis|mollis]]'', soft. ''Molluscus'' was itself an adaptation of [[Aristotle]]'s {{lang|grc|\u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1}} ''ta mal\u00e1kia'' (the soft ones; < {{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} ''malak\u00f3s'' \"soft\"), which he applied ''inter alia ''to [[cuttlefish]].<ref>{{LSJ|mala/kia2|\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1}}, {{LSJ|malako/s|\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2|ref}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Aristotle|title=History of Animals|chapter=Book I part 1, Book IV part 1, etc.|title-link=History of Animals}}</ref> The scientific study of molluscs is accordingly called [[malacology]].<ref>{{cite dictionary |contribution=Malacology |dictionary=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |editor=Little, L. |editor2=Fowler, H.W. |editor3=Coulson, J. |editor4=Onions, C.T. |publisher=Oxford University press |year=1964}}</ref>\n\nThe name '''Molluscoida''' was formerly used to denote a division of the animal kingdom containing the [[brachiopod]]s, [[bryozoa]]ns, and [[tunicate]]s, the members of the three groups having been supposed to somewhat resemble the molluscs.

Although molluscs are [[coelomate]]s, their [[coelom]]s are reduced to fairly small spaces enclosing the [[heart]] and gonads. The main body cavity is a [[hemocoel]] through which [[blood]] and [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] circulate and which encloses most of the other internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient [[hydrostatic skeleton]].<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> The blood of these molluscs contains the [[respiratory pigment]] [[hemocyanin]] as an [[oxygen]]-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria ([[Atrium (heart)|auricles]]), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]], which pumps it into the [[aorta]] (main [[artery]]), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" /> The atria of the heart also function as part of the [[excretory system]] by filtering waste products out of the blood and dumping it into the coelom as [[urine]]. A pair of [[nephridia]] (\"little kidneys\") to the rear of and connected to the coelom extracts any re-usable materials from the urine and dumps additional waste products into it, and then ejects it via tubes that discharge into the mantle cavity.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nExceptions to the above are the molluscs ''[[Planorbidae]]'' or ram's horn snails, which are air-breathing snails that use iron-based [[hemoglobin]] instead of the copper-based hemocyanin to carry oxygen through their blood.\n\n===Respiration===\nMost molluscs have only one pair of gills, or even only a singular gill. Generally, the gills are rather like feathers in shape, although some species have gills with filaments on only one side. They divide the mantle cavity so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through the mantle cavity, while the other two help to keep the gills clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly [[sediment]] entering the mantle cavity, the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Eating, digestion, and excretion===\n{{Annotated image/Snail radula working}}\nMembers of the mollusc family use [[intracellular digestion]] to function. Most molluscs have muscular mouths with [[radulae]], \"tongues\", bearing many rows of chitinous teeth, which are replaced from the rear as they wear out. The radula primarily functions to scrape [[bacteria]] and [[algae]] off rocks, and is associated with the [[odontophore]], a cartilaginous supporting organ.<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> The radula is unique to the molluscs and has no equivalent in any other animal.\n\nMolluscs' mouths also contain [[gland]]s that secrete slimy [[mucus]], to which the food sticks. Beating [[cilia]] (tiny \"hairs\") drive the mucus towards the stomach, so the mucus forms a long string called a \"food string\".<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nAt the tapered rear end of the stomach and projecting slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of [[feces]] and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nThe particles are sorted by yet another group of cilia, which send the smaller particles, mainly minerals, to the prostyle so eventually they are excreted, while the larger ones, mainly food, are sent to the stomach's [[cecum]] (a pouch with no other exit) to be digested. The sorting process is by no means perfect.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nPeriodically, circular muscles at the hindgut's entrance pinch off and excrete a piece of the prostyle, preventing the prostyle from growing too large. The anus, in the part of the mantle cavity, is swept by the outgoing \"lane\" of the current created by the gills. Carnivorous molluscs usually have simpler digestive systems.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nAs the head has largely disappeared in bivalves, the mouth has been equipped with labial palps (two on each side of the mouth) to collect the [[detritus]] from its mucus.<ref name=\"Handbook\" />\n\n===Nervous system===\n[[File:Gastropod nervous system.gif|left|thumb|Simplified diagram of the mollusc nervous system]]\nThe cephalic molluscs have two pairs of main [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]] organized around a number of paired ganglia, the [[viscera]]l cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia on both sides of the body are linked by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves). The ganglia above the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are located above the [[esophagus]] (gullet). The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are below the esophagus and their commissure and connectives to the cerebral and pleural ganglia surround the esophagus in a [[circumesophageal nerve ring]] or ''nerve collar''.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nThe acephalic molluscs (i.e., bivalves) also have this ring but it is less obvious and less important.  The bivalves have only three pairs of ganglia\u2014 cerebral, pedal, and visceral\u2014 with the visceral as the largest and most important of the three functioning as the principal center of \"thinking\".  Some such as the [[scallops]] have eyes around the edges of their shells which connect to a pair of looped nerves and which provide the ability to distinguish between light and shadow.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{see also|Reproductive system of gastropods|Reproductive system of cephalopods}}\n{{Annotated image/Trochophore larva}}\nThe simplest molluscan reproductive system relies on [[external fertilization]], but with more complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge [[trochophore]] larvae, more complex [[veliger]] larvae, or miniature adults. Two [[gonad]]s sit next to the [[coelom]], a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed [[ovum|ova]] or [[sperm]]. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on [[external fertilization]]. Some molluscs use [[internal fertilization]] and/or are [[hermaphrodite]]s, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nThe most basic molluscan [[larva]] is a [[trochophore]], which is [[plankton]]ic and feeds on floating food particles by using the two bands of cilia around its \"equator\" to sweep food into the mouth, which uses more cilia to drive them into the stomach, which uses further cilia to expel undigested remains through the anus. New tissue grows in the bands of [[mesoderm]] in the interior, so the apical tuft and anus are pushed further apart as the animal grows. The trochophore stage is often succeeded by a [[veliger]] stage in which the [[prototroch]], the \"equatorial\" band of cilia nearest the apical tuft, develops into the velum (\"veil\"), a pair of cilia-bearing lobes with which the larva swims. Eventually, the larva sinks to the seafloor and [[metamorphosis|metamorphoses]] into the adult form. While metamorphosis is the usual state in molluscs, the cephalopods differ in exhibiting direct development: the hatchling is a 'miniaturized' form of the adult.<ref name=Marin2004>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.crpv.2004.07.009| title = Molluscan shell proteins| date = October 2004| last1 = Marin | first1 = F.| last2 = Luquet | first2 = G.| journal = Comptes Rendus Palevol| volume = 3| issue = 6\u20137| pages = 469 }}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Feeding===\nMost molluscs are herbivorous, grazing on algae or filter feeders.  For those grazing, two feeding strategies are predominant. Some feed on microscopic, filamentous algae, often using their radula as a 'rake' to comb up filaments from the sea floor.  Others feed on macroscopic 'plants' such as kelp, rasping the plant surface with its radula.  To employ this strategy, the plant has to be large enough for the mollusc to 'sit' on, so smaller macroscopic plants are not as often eaten as their larger counterparts.<ref name=\"Steneck1982\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00409596 | last1 = Steneck | first1 = R.S. | last2 = Watling | first2 = L. | title = Feeding capabilities and limitation of herbivorous molluscs: A functional group approach | journal = Marine Biology | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 299\u2013319 | date = July 1982 }}</ref>\n[[Filter feeders]] are molluscs that feed by straining suspended matter and food particle from water, typically by passing the water over their gills.

Numerous molluscs also live in [[freshwater mollusc|freshwater]] and [[Terrestrial molluscs|terrestrial]] [[habitat]]s. They are highly diverse, not just in size and  [[anatomical]] structure, but also in behaviour and  habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 8 or 9&nbsp;[[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[class (biology)|classes]], of which two are entirely [[extinct]]. [[Cephalopod]] molluscs, such as [[squid]], [[cuttlefish]], and [[octopus]]es, are among the most [[neurobiology|neurologically advanced]] of all [[invertebrate]]s\u2014and either the [[giant squid]] or the [[colossal squid]] is the largest known invertebrate species. The [[gastropod]]s ([[snail]]s and [[slug]]s) are by far the most numerous molluscs and account for 80% of the total classified species.\n\nThe three most universal features defining modern molluscs are a [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] with a significant cavity used for breathing and [[excretion]], the presence of a [[radula]] (except for [[bivalves]]), and the structure of the [[nervous system]]. Other than these common elements, molluscs express great morphological diversity, so many textbooks base their descriptions on a \"hypothetical ancestral mollusc\" (see image below). This has a single, \"[[limpet]]-like\" [[gastropod shell|shell]] on top, which is made of [[protein]]s and [[chitin]] reinforced with [[calcium carbonate]], and is secreted by a mantle covering the whole upper surface. The underside of the animal consists of a single muscular \"foot\". Although molluscs are [[coelomate]]s, the [[coelom]] tends to be small.\nThe main body cavity is a [[hemocoel]] through which [[blood]] circulates; as such, their [[circulatory system]]s are mainly [[Open circulatory system|open]]. The \"generalized\" mollusc's feeding system consists of a rasping \"tongue\", the radula, and a complex digestive system in which exuded [[mucus]] and microscopic, muscle-powered \"hairs\" called [[cilia]] play various important roles. The generalized mollusc has two paired [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]], or three in [[bivalve]]s. The [[brain]], in species that have one, encircles the [[esophagus]]. Most molluscs have [[eyes]], and all have sensors to detect chemicals, vibrations, and touch. The simplest type of molluscan [[reproductive system]] relies on [[external fertilization]], but more complex variations occur. Nearly all produce [[egg (biology)|eggs]], from which may emerge [[trochophore]] [[larvae]], more complex [[veliger]] larvae, or miniature adults. The coelomic  cavity is reduced. They have an open circulatory system and kidney-like organs for excretion.\n\nGood evidence exists for the appearance of gastropods, [[cephalopod]]s, and bivalves in the [[Cambrian]] period, 541\u2013485.4&nbsp;million years ago. However, the evolutionary history both of molluscs' emergence from the ancestral [[Lophotrochozoa]] and of their diversification into the well-known living and [[fossil]] forms are still subjects of vigorous debate among scientists.\n[[File:Fossilized_Ammonite_Mollusk_displayed_at_Philippine_National_Museum.jpg|thumb|Fossilized ammonite displayed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]]]\nMolluscs have been and still are an important food source for [[anatomically modern human]]s. A risk of food poisoning exists from toxins that can accumulate in certain molluscs under specific conditions, however, and because of this, many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably [[pearl]]s, [[mother of pearl]], [[Tyrian purple]] dye, and [[sea silk]]. Their shells have also been [[Shell money|used]] as [[money]] in some preindustrial societies.\n\nMollusc species can also represent hazards or pests for human activities. The bite of the [[blue-ringed octopus]] is often fatal, and that of ''[[Octopus apollyon]]'' causes [[inflammation]] that can last over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical [[cone shell]]s can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in [[neurological]] research. [[Schistosomiasis]] (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis, or snail fever) is transmitted to humans by water snail hosts, and affects about 200&nbsp;million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some [[ecosystem]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe words [[wikt:mollusc|mollusc]] and mollusk are both derived from the French ''mollusque'', which originated from the [[Latin]] ''molluscus'', from ''[[wikt:mollis|mollis]]'', soft. ''Molluscus'' was itself an adaptation of [[Aristotle]]'s {{lang|grc|\u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1}} ''ta mal\u00e1kia'' (the soft ones; < {{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} ''malak\u00f3s'' \"soft\"), which he applied ''inter alia ''to [[cuttlefish]].<ref>{{LSJ|mala/kia2|\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1}}, {{LSJ|malako/s|\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2|ref}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Aristotle|title=History of Animals|chapter=Book I part 1, Book IV part 1, etc.|title-link=History of Animals}}</ref> The scientific study of molluscs is accordingly called [[malacology]].<ref>{{cite dictionary |contribution=Malacology |dictionary=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |editor=Little, L. |editor2=Fowler, H.W. |editor3=Coulson, J. |editor4=Onions, C.T. |publisher=Oxford University press |year=1964}}</ref>\n\nThe name '''Molluscoida''' was formerly used to denote a division of the animal kingdom containing the [[brachiopod]]s, [[bryozoa]]ns, and [[tunicate]]s, the members of the three groups having been supposed to somewhat resemble the molluscs.

Although molluscs are [[coelomate]]s, their [[coelom]]s are reduced to fairly small spaces enclosing the [[heart]] and gonads. The main body cavity is a [[hemocoel]] through which [[blood]] and [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] circulate and which encloses most of the other internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient [[hydrostatic skeleton]].<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> The blood of these molluscs contains the [[respiratory pigment]] [[hemocyanin]] as an [[oxygen]]-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria ([[Atrium (heart)|auricles]]), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]], which pumps it into the [[aorta]] (main [[artery]]), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" /> The atria of the heart also function as part of the [[excretory system]] by filtering waste products out of the blood and dumping it into the coelom as [[urine]]. A pair of [[nephridia]] (\"little kidneys\") to the rear of and connected to the coelom extracts any re-usable materials from the urine and dumps additional waste products into it, and then ejects it via tubes that discharge into the mantle cavity.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nExceptions to the above are the molluscs ''[[Planorbidae]]'' or ram's horn snails, which are air-breathing snails that use iron-based [[hemoglobin]] instead of the copper-based hemocyanin to carry oxygen through their blood.\n\n===Respiration===\nMost molluscs have only one pair of gills, or even only a singular gill. Generally, the gills are rather like feathers in shape, although some species have gills with filaments on only one side. They divide the mantle cavity so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through the mantle cavity, while the other two help to keep the gills clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly [[sediment]] entering the mantle cavity, the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Eating, digestion, and excretion===\n{{Annotated image/Snail radula working}}\nMembers of the mollusc family use [[intracellular digestion]] to function. Most molluscs have muscular mouths with [[radulae]], \"tongues\", bearing many rows of chitinous teeth, which are replaced from the rear as they wear out. The radula primarily functions to scrape [[bacteria]] and [[algae]] off rocks, and is associated with the [[odontophore]], a cartilaginous supporting organ.<ref name=\"Handbook\" /> The radula is unique to the molluscs and has no equivalent in any other animal.\n\nMolluscs' mouths also contain [[gland]]s that secrete slimy [[mucus]], to which the food sticks. Beating [[cilia]] (tiny \"hairs\") drive the mucus towards the stomach, so the mucus forms a long string called a \"food string\".<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nAt the tapered rear end of the stomach and projecting slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of [[feces]] and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nThe particles are sorted by yet another group of cilia, which send the smaller particles, mainly minerals, to the prostyle so eventually they are excreted, while the larger ones, mainly food, are sent to the stomach's [[cecum]] (a pouch with no other exit) to be digested. The sorting process is by no means perfect.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nPeriodically, circular muscles at the hindgut's entrance pinch off and excrete a piece of the prostyle, preventing the prostyle from growing too large. The anus, in the part of the mantle cavity, is swept by the outgoing \"lane\" of the current created by the gills. Carnivorous molluscs usually have simpler digestive systems.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nAs the head has largely disappeared in bivalves, the mouth has been equipped with labial palps (two on each side of the mouth) to collect the [[detritus]] from its mucus.<ref name=\"Handbook\" />\n\n===Nervous system===\n[[File:Gastropod nervous system.gif|left|thumb|Simplified diagram of the mollusc nervous system]]\nThe cephalic molluscs have two pairs of main [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]] organized around a number of paired ganglia, the [[viscera]]l cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia on both sides of the body are linked by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves). The ganglia above the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are located above the [[esophagus]] (gullet). The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are below the esophagus and their commissure and connectives to the cerebral and pleural ganglia surround the esophagus in a [[circumesophageal nerve ring]] or ''nerve collar''.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nThe acephalic molluscs (i.e., bivalves) also have this ring but it is less obvious and less important.  The bivalves have only three pairs of ganglia\u2014 cerebral, pedal, and visceral\u2014 with the visceral as the largest and most important of the three functioning as the principal center of \"thinking\".  Some such as the [[scallops]] have eyes around the edges of their shells which connect to a pair of looped nerves and which provide the ability to distinguish between light and shadow.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{see also|Reproductive system of gastropods|Reproductive system of cephalopods}}\n{{Annotated image/Trochophore larva}}\nThe simplest molluscan reproductive system relies on [[external fertilization]], but with more complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge [[trochophore]] larvae, more complex [[veliger]] larvae, or miniature adults. Two [[gonad]]s sit next to the [[coelom]], a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed [[ovum|ova]] or [[sperm]]. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on [[external fertilization]]. Some molluscs use [[internal fertilization]] and/or are [[hermaphrodite]]s, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGen\" />\n\nThe most basic molluscan [[larva]] is a [[trochophore]], which is [[plankton]]ic and feeds on floating food particles by using the two bands of cilia around its \"equator\" to sweep food into the mouth, which uses more cilia to drive them into the stomach, which uses further cilia to expel undigested remains through the anus. New tissue grows in the bands of [[mesoderm]] in the interior, so the apical tuft and anus are pushed further apart as the animal grows. The trochophore stage is often succeeded by a [[veliger]] stage in which the [[prototroch]], the \"equatorial\" band of cilia nearest the apical tuft, develops into the velum (\"veil\"), a pair of cilia-bearing lobes with which the larva swims. Eventually, the larva sinks to the seafloor and [[metamorphosis|metamorphoses]] into the adult form. While metamorphosis is the usual state in molluscs, the cephalopods differ in exhibiting direct development: the hatchling is a 'miniaturized' form of the adult.<ref name=Marin2004>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.crpv.2004.07.009| title = Molluscan shell proteins| date = October 2004| last1 = Marin | first1 = F.| last2 = Luquet | first2 = G.| journal = Comptes Rendus Palevol| volume = 3| issue = 6\u20137| pages = 469 }}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Feeding===\nMost molluscs are herbivorous, grazing on algae or filter feeders.  For those grazing, two feeding strategies are predominant. Some feed on microscopic, filamentous algae, often using their radula as a 'rake' to comb up filaments from the sea floor.  Others feed on macroscopic 'plants' such as kelp, rasping the plant surface with its radula.  To employ this strategy, the plant has to be large enough for the mollusc to 'sit' on, so smaller macroscopic plants are not as often eaten as their larger counterparts.<ref name=\"Steneck1982\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00409596 | last1 = Steneck | first1 = R.S. | last2 = Watling | first2 = L. | title = Feeding capabilities and limitation of herbivorous molluscs: A functional group approach | journal = Marine Biology | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 299\u2013319 | date = July 1982 }}</ref>\n[[Filter feeders]] are molluscs that feed by straining suspended matter and food particle from water, typically by passing the water over their gills.
