Family sources have stated that; 11 years ago, Jinnat Ali's body suddenly started to grow abnormally. His body is known to be still continuing to grow at the age of 23. Ali's height is predicted to keep increasing, and therefore he must eat at least a kilogram of food every day - to keep a sufficient muscle mass and healthy weight. According to Dr. Md Farid Uddin, the doctor of [[BSMMU]], Jinnat suffers from acromegalic gigantism\u2014a - condition caused by a tumor on his pituitary gland which causes his body to produce too many growth hormones. Ali's treatment is now undergoing at [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University]]  in the capital, [[Dhaka]].
