He began his career as a stand-up comedian, first entering the national spotlight when he was featured on [[Billy Crystal]]'s first cable TV special. He went on to become a series regular on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]''. He made numerous guest appearances on a variety of television shows, such as ''[[Cheers]]''. His film credits include ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'', ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Young Doctors in Love]]'', ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]'', ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', and ''[[Trial and Error (1997 film)|Trial and Error]]'', one of his few starring roles.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1998, he played [[Cosmo Kramer]] on the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', receiving the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] three times. During the run of ''Seinfeld'', he made a guest appearance in ''[[Mad About You]]''. After ''Seinfeld'', Richards starred in his own sitcom, ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', which lasted less than one full season.\n\nWhen ''Seinfeld'' ended in 1998, Richards returned to stand-up comedy. He incited media furor while performing at the [[Laugh Factory]] comedy club in late 2006 after a cell phone video was published of him launching into an expletive-laced racist tirade after earlier interruptions from a group of late-arriving audience members.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/20/kramers-racist-tirade-caught-on-tape|title=\"Kramer's\" Racist Tirade \u2013 Caught on Tape|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=TMZ.com|year=2006|author=TMZ Staff|work=In The Zone}}</ref> Subsequently, due to significant media coverage of the event, Richards announced his retirement from stand-up early in 2007. He appeared as himself in the [[Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|seventh season]] of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' in 2009, acting alongside his fellow cast members for the first time since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|finale]], as well as lampooning his incident at the Laugh Factory.

In 1980, he began as one of the cast members on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' television show, where [[Larry David]] was a writer. This included a famous instance in which guest [[Andy Kaufman]] refused to deliver his scripted lines, leading Richards to bring the [[cue card]]s on screen to Kaufman, causing him to throw his drink into Richards's face before a small riot ensued (Richards later claimed he was in on the joke).<ref name=\"fac\">[http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript] via [[First Amendment Center]], Recorded February 28, 2002, in Aspen, Colorado {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331131924/http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref> The film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' featured a re-enactment of the [[Fridays (TV series)#Andy Kaufman incident|Andy Kaufman incident]] in which Richards was portrayed by actor [[Norm Macdonald]] (although he is never referred to by name so he could be seen as a composite character taking the place of Richards).<ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b|title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan|publisher=Funnyordie.com|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|title=Michael Richards \u2013 First Amendment Center \u2013 news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition|publisher=|access-date=August 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808113050/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Richards had a supporting role in [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s comedy film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' as janitor Stanley Spadowski. On television, Richards also appeared in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (as an unscrupulous [[bookie]]), ''[[Cheers]]'' (as a character trying to collect on an old bet with [[Sam Malone]]), and made several guest appearances with [[Jay Leno]] as an accident-prone fitness expert.\n\nAccording to an interview with executive producer David Hoberman, ABC first conceived the series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' as a procedural police comedy with an [[Inspector Clouseau]]-like character suffering from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]. Hoberman said ABC wanted Richards to play [[Adrian Monk]], but he turned it down.<ref>from \"Mr Monk and His Origins,\" a special feature packaged with the Season One DVDs.</ref>\n\n=== ''Seinfeld'' ===\n[[File:Michael Richards Jerry Seinfeld.jpg|thumb|Richards with [[Jerry Seinfeld]] at the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 1989, he was cast as [[Cosmo Kramer]] in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which was created by fellow ''Fridays'' cast member [[Larry David]] and comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. Although it got off to a slow start, by the mid-1990s, the show had become one of the most popular [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] in television history. The series ended its nine-year run in 1998 at #1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. In the setting of ''Seinfeld'', Kramer is usually referred to by his last name only and is the neighbor of the show's [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|eponymous character]]. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, was revealed in the sixth-season episode \"[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]\".\n\nRichards won more Emmys than any other cast member on ''Seinfeld''. He took home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993, 1994 and 1997.\n\nStarting in 2004, he and his fellow ''Seinfeld'' cast members provided interviews and audio commentaries for the ''Seinfeld'' DVDs, but Richards stopped providing audio commentary after Season{{nbsp}}5 though he continued to provide interviews.\n\n=== ''The Michael Richards Show'' ===\nIn 2000, after the end of ''Seinfeld'', Richards began work on a new series for NBC, his first major project since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s finale. ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', for which the actor received co-writer and co-[[Television producer|executive producer]] credits, was originally conceived as a comedy/mystery starring Richards as a bumbling private investigator. However, after the first pilot failed with test audiences, NBC ordered that the show be retooled into a more conventional, office-based sitcom before its premiere. After a few weeks of poor ratings and negative reviews, it was cancelled.\n\n===2006 Laugh Factory incident ===\nDuring a performance on November 17, 2006, at the [[Laugh Factory]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Richards launched into a [[racism|racist]] rant in response to reported heckling and interruptions from a small group of black audience members. Richards was recorded shouting \"He's a [[nigger]]!\" several times and making references to [[lynching]] and the [[Jim Crow]] era.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\"/><ref name=\"Vibe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231201005/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archivedate=December 31, 2006|title=Comedian Michael \"Kramer\" Richards Goes into Racial Tirade, Banned From Laugh Factory|accessdate=2006-11-21|publisher=[[VIBE]].com|year=2006|author=Mariel Concepci\u00f3n|work=News wire}}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100242.html |title=\"Seinfeld\" Comic Richards Apologizes for Racial Rant |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= November 21, 2006|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref><ref name=\"Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/richards-deeply-deeply-sorry-for-racial-slurs-1.618610|title=Richards 'deeply, deeply sorry' for racial slurs|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=CBC arts | date=November 20, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Reuters-2006\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2006/11/20/us-richards-idUSN2041340020061120|title=\"Seinfeld\" Star Richards Under Fire For Racial Outburst|accessdate=2013-06-28|publisher=Reuters|work=News wire|date=November 20, 2006}}</ref> <!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: SEE REMARKS ABOVE THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ABOUT CONSENSUS ON THE LAUGH FACTORY INCIDENT, AS IN TALK ARCHIVE 2.

He began his career as a stand-up comedian, first entering the national spotlight when he was featured on [[Billy Crystal]]'s first cable TV special. He went on to become a series regular on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]''. He made numerous guest appearances on a variety of television shows, such as ''[[Cheers]]''. His film credits include ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'', ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Young Doctors in Love]]'', ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]'', ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', and ''[[Trial and Error (1997 film)|Trial and Error]]'', one of his few starring roles.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1998, he played [[Cosmo Kramer]] on the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', receiving the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] three times. During the run of ''Seinfeld'', he made a guest appearance in ''[[Mad About You]]''. After ''Seinfeld'', Richards starred in his own sitcom, ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', which lasted less than one full season.\n\nWhen ''Seinfeld'' ended in 1998, Richards returned to stand-up comedy. He incited media furor while performing at the [[Laugh Factory]] comedy club in late 2006 after a cell phone video was published of him launching into an expletive-laced racist tirade after earlier interruptions from a group of late-arriving audience members.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/20/kramers-racist-tirade-caught-on-tape|title=\"Kramer's\" Racist Tirade \u2013 Caught on Tape|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=TMZ.com|year=2006|author=TMZ Staff|work=In The Zone}}</ref> Subsequently, due to significant media coverage of the event he announced his retirement from stand-up early in 2007. He appeared as himself in the [[Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|seventh season]] of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' in 2009, acting alongside his fellow cast members for the first time since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|finale]], as well as lampooning his incident at the Laugh Factory.

In 1980, he began as one of the cast members on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' television show, where [[Larry David]] was a writer. This included a famous instance in which guest [[Andy Kaufman]] refused to deliver his scripted lines, leading Richards to bring the [[cue card]]s on screen to Kaufman, causing him to throw his drink into Richards's face before a small riot ensued (Richards later claimed he was in on the joke).<ref name=\"fac\">[http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript] via [[First Amendment Center]], Recorded February 28, 2002, in Aspen, Colorado {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331131924/http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref> The film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' featured a re-enactment of the [[Fridays (TV series)#Andy Kaufman incident|Andy Kaufman incident]] in which Richards was portrayed by actor [[Norm Macdonald]] (although he is never referred to by name so he could be seen as a composite character taking the place of Richards).<ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b|title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan|publisher=Funnyordie.com|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|title=Michael Richards \u2013 First Amendment Center \u2013 news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition|publisher=|access-date=August 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808113050/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Richards had a supporting role in [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s comedy film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' as janitor Stanley Spadowski. On television, Richards also appeared in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (as an unscrupulous [[bookie]]), ''[[Cheers]]'' (as a character trying to collect on an old bet with [[Sam Malone]]), and made several guest appearances with [[Jay Leno]] as an accident-prone fitness expert.\n\nAccording to an interview with executive producer David Hoberman, ABC first conceived the series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' as a procedural police comedy with an [[Inspector Clouseau]]-like character suffering from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]. Hoberman said ABC wanted Richards to play [[Adrian Monk]], but he turned it down.<ref>from \"Mr Monk and His Origins,\" a special feature packaged with the Season One DVDs.</ref>\n\n=== ''Seinfeld'' ===\n[[File:Michael Richards Jerry Seinfeld.jpg|thumb|Richards with [[Jerry Seinfeld]] at the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 1989, he was cast as [[Cosmo Kramer]] in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which was created by fellow ''Fridays'' cast member [[Larry David]] and comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. Although it got off to a slow start, by the mid-1990s, the show had become one of the most popular [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] in television history. The series ended its nine-year run in 1998 at #1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. In the setting of ''Seinfeld'', Kramer is usually referred to by his last name only and is the neighbor of the show's [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|eponymous character]]. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, was revealed in the sixth-season episode \"[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]\".\n\nRichards won more Emmys than any other cast member on ''Seinfeld''. He took home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993, 1994 and 1997.\n\nStarting in 2004, he and his fellow ''Seinfeld'' cast members provided interviews and audio commentaries for the ''Seinfeld'' DVDs, but Richards stopped providing audio commentary after Season{{nbsp}}5 though he continued to provide interviews.\n\n=== ''The Michael Richards Show'' ===\nIn 2000, after the end of ''Seinfeld'', Richards began work on a new series for NBC, his first major project since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s finale. ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', for which the actor received co-writer and co-[[Television producer|executive producer]] credits, was originally conceived as a comedy/mystery starring Richards as a bumbling private investigator. However, after the first pilot failed with test audiences, NBC ordered that the show be retooled into a more conventional, office-based sitcom before its premiere. After a few weeks of poor ratings and negative reviews, it was cancelled.\n\n===2006 Laugh Factory incident ===\nDuring a performance on November 17, 2006, at the [[Laugh Factory]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Richards launched into a [[racism|racist]] rant in response to reported heckling and interruptions from a small group of black audience members. Richards was recorded shouting \"He's a [[nigger]]!\" several times and making references to [[lynching]] and the [[Jim Crow]] era.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\"/><ref name=\"Vibe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231201005/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archivedate=December 31, 2006|title=Comedian Michael \"Kramer\" Richards Goes into Racial Tirade, Banned From Laugh Factory|accessdate=2006-11-21|publisher=[[VIBE]].com|year=2006|author=Mariel Concepci\u00f3n|work=News wire}}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100242.html |title=\"Seinfeld\" Comic Richards Apologizes for Racial Rant |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= November 21, 2006|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref><ref name=\"Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/richards-deeply-deeply-sorry-for-racial-slurs-1.618610|title=Richards 'deeply, deeply sorry' for racial slurs|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=CBC arts | date=November 20, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Reuters-2006\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2006/11/20/us-richards-idUSN2041340020061120|title=\"Seinfeld\" Star Richards Under Fire For Racial Outburst|accessdate=2013-06-28|publisher=Reuters|work=News wire|date=November 20, 2006}}</ref> <!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: SEE REMARKS ABOVE THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ABOUT CONSENSUS ON THE LAUGH FACTORY INCIDENT, AS IN TALK ARCHIVE 2.
