He claimed that the medicine he had been taught to practice sometimes did the patient more harm than good:\n<blockquote>My sense of duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown pathological state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice in the first years of my married life and occupied myself solely with [[chemistry]] and writing.<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter giving up his practice around 1784, Hahnemann made his living chiefly as a writer and translator, while resolving also to investigate the causes of medicine's alleged errors. While translating [[William Cullen]]'s ''A Treatise on the Materia Medica'', Hahnemann encountered the claim that [[cinchona]], the bark of a Peruvian tree, was effective in treating [[malaria]] because of its astringency. Hahnemann believed that other astringent substances are not effective against malaria and began to research cinchona's effect on the human body by self-application. Noting that the drug induced malaria-like symptoms in himself,<ref>Haehl, vol. 1, p.38; Dudgeon, p.48</ref> he concluded that it would do so in any healthy individual. This led him to postulate a healing principle: \"that which can produce a set of symptoms in a healthy individual, can treat a sick individual who is manifesting a similar set of symptoms.\"<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/> This principle, ''like cures like'', became the basis for an approach to medicine which he gave the name [[homeopathy]]. He first used the term homeopathy in his essay ''Indications of the Homeopathic Employment of Medicines in Ordinary Practice'', published in [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland|Hufeland]]'s ''Journal'' in 1807.<ref>Gumpert, Martin (1945) ''Hahnemann: The Adventurous Career of a Medical Rebel'', New York: Fischer, p. 130.</ref>\n\n=== Development of homeopathy ===\nFollowing up the work of the Viennese physician [[Anton von St\u00f6rck]], Hahnemann tested substances for the effects they produced on a healthy individual, presupposing (as von St\u00f6rck had claimed) that they may heal the same ills that they caused. His researches led him to agree with von St\u00f6rck that the toxic effects of ingested substances are often broadly parallel to certain disease states,<ref>Dudgeon, pp.xxi\u2013xxii; Cook, p.95</ref> and his exploration of historical cases of poisoning in the medical literature further implied a more generalised medicinal \"law of similars\".<ref>Dudgeon, p.49 & p.176; Haehl, vol. 1, p.40</ref> He later devised methods of diluting the drugs he was testing in order to mitigate their toxic effects. He claimed that these dilutions, when prepared according to his technique of \"potentization\" using dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking), were still effective in alleviating the same symptoms in the sick. His more systematic  experiments with dose reduction really commenced around 1800\u201301 when, on the basis of his \"law of similars,\" he had begun using ''[[Ipecacuanha]]'' for the treatment of coughs and [[Belladonna (plant)|Belladonna]] for scarlet fever.<ref>Cook, pp.96\u20137; Dudgeon, pp.338\u2013340 & pp.394\u2013408</ref>\n\nHe first published an article about the homeopathic approach in a [[German-language]] medical journal in 1796. Following a series of further essays, he published in 1810 \"Organon of the Rational Art of Healing\", followed over the years by four further editions entitled ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', the first systematic treatise and containing all his detailed instructions on the subject. A 6th ''Organon'' edition, unpublished during his lifetime, and dating from February 1842, was only published many years after his death. It consisted  of a 5th ''Organon'' containing extensive handwritten annotations.<ref>[http://www.minimum.com/reviews/organon-sixth.htm Sixth Organon book review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021000237/http://www.minimum.com/reviews/organon-sixth.htm |date=21 October 2010 }}.

Retrieved on 16 May 2012.</ref> The ''Organon'' is widely regarded as a remodelled form of an essay he published in 1806 called \"The Medicine of Experience\", which had been published in Hufeland's Journal. Of the ''Organon'', [[Robert Ellis Dudgeon]] states it \"was an amplification and extension of his \"Medicine of Experience\", worked up with greater care, and put into a more methodical and [[Aphorism|aphoristic]] form, after the model of the Hippocratic writings.\"<ref>[[Robert Ellis Dudgeon|Dudgeon, R.

As required by the university statutes, to become a faculty member he was required to submit and defend a thesis on a medical topic of his choice. On 26 June 1812, Hahnemann presented a [[Latin]] thesis, entitled ''\"A Medical Historical Dissertation on the Helleborism of the Ancients.\"''<ref>Bradford, p. 93.</ref> His thesis very thoroughly examined the historical literature and sought  to differentiate between the ancient use of ''[[Helleborus niger]]'', or black hellebore, and the medicinal uses of the \"white hellebore\", botanically ''[[Veratrum album]]'', both of which are poisonous plants.<ref>Haehl, Vol. 2, p. 96.</ref>\n\nHahnemann continued practicing and researching homeopathy, as well as writing and lecturing for the rest of his life.

Leopold emigrated to England, and he practised homeopathy in London. He retired to the [[Isle of Wight]] and died there at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Dr Leopold Suss-Hahnemann's youngest daughter, Amalia, had two children, Winifred (born in 1898) and Herbert. William Herbert Tankard-Hahnemann (1922\u20132009) was Winifred's son. He served as a Major in the British Army during World War II, and then had a career in the city of London. He was at one point appointed as a Freeman of the City of London.

He claimed that the medicine he had been taught to practice sometimes did the patient more harm than good:\n<blockquote>My sense of duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown pathological state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice in the first years of my married life and occupied myself solely with [[chemistry]] and writing.<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter giving up his practice around 1784, Hahnemann made his living chiefly as a writer and translator, while resolving also to investigate the causes of medicine's alleged errors. While translating [[William Cullen]]'s ''A Treatise on the Materia Medica'', Hahnemann encountered the claim that [[cinchona]], the bark of a Peruvian tree, was effective in treating [[malaria]] because of its astringency. Hahnemann believed that other astringent substances are not effective against malaria and began to research cinchona's effect on the human body by self-application. Noting that the drug induced malaria-like symptoms in himself,<ref>Haehl, vol. 1, p.38; Dudgeon, p.48</ref> he concluded that it would do so in any healthy individual. This led him to postulate a healing principle: \"that which can produce a set of symptoms in a healthy individual, can treat a sick individual who is manifesting a similar set of symptoms.\"<ref name=\"skylarkbio\"/> This principle, ''like cures like'', became the basis for an approach to medicine which he gave the name [[homeopathy]]. He first used the term homeopathy in his essay ''Indications of the Homeopathic Employment of Medicines in Ordinary Practice'', published in [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland|Hufeland]]'s ''Journal'' in 1807.<ref>Gumpert, Martin (1945) ''Hahnemann: The Adventurous Career of a Medical Rebel'', New York: Fischer, p. 130.</ref>\n\n=== Development of homeopathy ===\nFollowing up the work of the Viennese physician [[Anton von St\u00f6rck]], Hahnemann tested substances for the effects they produced on a healthy individual, presupposing (as von St\u00f6rck had claimed) that they may heal the same ills that they caused. His researches led him to agree with von St\u00f6rck that the toxic effects of ingested substances are often broadly parallel to certain disease states,<ref>Dudgeon, pp.xxi\u2013xxii; Cook, p.95</ref> and his exploration of historical cases of poisoning in the medical literature further implied a more generalised medicinal \"law of similars\".<ref>Dudgeon, p.49 & p.176; Haehl, vol. 1, p.40</ref> He later devised methods of diluting the drugs he was testing in order to mitigate their toxic effects. He claimed that these dilutions, when prepared according to his technique of \"potentization\" using dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking), were still effective in alleviating the same symptoms in the sick. His more systematic  experiments with dose reduction really commenced around 1800\u201301 when, on the basis of his \"law of similars,\" he had begun using ''[[Ipecacuanha]]'' for the treatment of coughs and [[Belladonna (plant)|Belladonna]] for scarlet fever.<ref>Cook, pp.96\u20137; Dudgeon, pp.338\u2013340 & pp.394\u2013408</ref>\n\nHe first published an article about the homeopathic approach in a [[German-language]] medical journal in 1796. Following a series of further essays, he published in 1810 \"Organon of the Rational Art of Healing\", followed over the years by four further editions entitled ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', the first systematic treatise and containing all his detailed instructions on the subject. A 6th ''Organon'' edition, unpublished during his lifetime, and dating from February 1842, was only published many years after his death. It consisted  of a 5th ''Organon'' containing extensive handwritten annotations.<ref>[http://www.minimum.com/reviews/organon-sixth.htm Sixth Organon book review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021000237/http://www.minimum.com/reviews/organon-sixth.htm |date=21 October 2010 }}.

Retrieved on 16 May 2012.</ref> The ''Organon'' is widely regarded as a remodelled form of an essay he published in 1806 called \"The Medicine of Experience\", which had been published in Hufeland's Journal.

As required by the university statutes, to become a faculty member he was required to submit and defend a thesis on a medical topic of his choice. On 26 June 1812, Hahnemann presented a [[Latin]] thesis, entitled ''\"A Medical Historical Dissertation on the Helleborism of the Ancients.\"''<ref>Bradford, p. 93.</ref> His thesis very thoroughly examined the historical literature and sought  to differentiate between the ancient use of ''[[Helleborus niger]]'', or black hellebore, and the medicinal uses of the \"white hellebore\", botanically ''[[Veratrum album]]'', both of which are poisonous plants.<ref>Haehl, Vol. 2, p. 96.</ref>\n\nHahnemann continued practicing and researching homeopathy, as well as writing and lecturing for the rest of his life.

Leopold emigrated to England, and he practised homeopathy in London. He retired to the [[Isle of Wight]] and died there at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Dr Leopold Suss-Hahnemann's youngest daughter, Amalia, had two children, Winifred (born in 1898) and Herbert. William Herbert Tankard-Hahnemann (1922\u20132009) was Winifred's son. He served as a Major in the British Army during World War II, and then had a career in the city of London. He was at one point appointed as a Freeman of the City of London.
