Larson]]. A re-edit of the episode was released theatrically as '''''Battlestar Galactica''''' in Canada, Australia and some countries in Europe and Latin America before the television series aired in the United States, in order to help recoup its high production costs.<ref name=\"CV\">[http://www.kobol.com/archives/bgdiff.html#V2 The Different Versions of the Battlestar Galactica Pilot Episode]</ref> Later, in May 1979, the feature-film edit was also released in the United States (see below).\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Battlestar Galactica'' is set in a distant star system, in an age described as \"the seventh millennium of time\". Twelve colonies of humans, living on different worlds, have been fighting a 1,000 year war against the [[robotics|robotic]] race of [[Cylon (1978)|Cylons]], who seek to exterminate all of humanity. The Cylons have unexpectedly [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]], through the diplomatic agency of a human, [[Count Baltar]]. The human leaders, called the Council of the Twelve (with one representative from each colony), and the commanders of their military fleet are all too pleased by the Cylon offer of peace, which ends so many years of warfare. The powerful \"Battlestars\" are assembled for armistice talks with Humanity's age-old robotic enemy. But it's a deception: the Cylons have no intention of making peace, and Baltar has betrayed humanity for the promise that his colony would be spared from extermination.  (A promise that goes unfulfilled.)\n\nOnly Commander Adama, of the battlestar ''Galactica'', suspects that the Cylons are planning a trap, and orders a recon patrol, consisting of his two best pilots: his eldest son, Captain Apollo, and Lieutenant Starbuck. Adama's younger son, Zac, convinces Starbuck to let him go in his place. The patrol discovers a vast Cylon armada waiting in ambush behind a moon named Cimtar, but the Cylons jam their communications. Cylon fighters pursue the two Vipers, and Zac's fighter is hit. This forces Apollo to leave him behind, so that the fleet can be warned. Zac's Viper is destroyed by the Cylons just before he reaches the fleet.\n\nBaltar manipulates President Adar into prohibiting the launch of fighters as the Cylons close in on the fleet. Frustrated, Adama orders the ''Galactica''{{'}}s Viper squadrons be placed on full alert, with their fighters ready to launch. As the Cylons attack, the ''Galactica'' is able to launch its fighters first, while the other battlestars are caught off-guard. The ''Atlantia'', with President Adar aboard, is destroyed, as are apparently the other battlestars; ''Galactica'' alone survives the Cylon assault. Apollo informs Adama that the Cylons were accompanied by refueling tankers, and Adama realizes that this would allow the fighters to operate far from their base ships (known as \"basestars\"), which must be operating somewhere else. He orders the ''Galactica'' to withdraw and protect the planet Caprica, Adama's homeworld, but they are too late, as the Cylon fleet has launched simultaneous massive assaults on all the Colonies at the very same time the attack on the battlestars has commenced.\n\nWith the Colonies in ruins, Adama collects as many survivors as possible, and orders every intact civilian ship to take survivors and follow the ''Galactica''. They hope that the ''Galactica'' can protect this ragtag fleet long enough to find the legendary thirteenth human colony. It is called [[Earth]], but the location of this lost colony is known only to the last lord of [[Kobol]], the planet which was the original home of Man, but which was abandoned thousands of years earlier, when the Thirteen Tribes migrated to the stars. Helping Adama in the quest for Earth are his son, Captain Apollo, commander of the ''Galactica''{{'}}s strike wing; Lieutenant Starbuck, the ''Galactica''{{'}}s best fighter pilot and Apollo's best friend; Lieutenant Boomer, another fighter pilot; and Colonel Tigh, Adama's second-in-command.\n\nThe Cylon Imperious Leader, determined that no human at all shall survive, orders Baltar's execution after his usefulness is over, but (as retro-actively revealed in the television series version of the film) he is spared at the last moment in order to help the Cylons hunt down the human fleet. After initially escaping the Cylons across a massive starfield called the Nova of Madagon (referred to as such due to its extremely dangerous, hot environment, and Cylon mines), the ''Galactica'' and the fugitive fleet find brief respite on the [[resort]] planet of Carillon, where they hope to find food and fuel for their journey. As much of the fleet's food supplies were contaminated by pluton bombs during the Cylon attack, the fleet is in desperate straits, and must find a food source soon or face starvation.\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent that there is more to Carillon than meets the eye. The fact that Carillon has more than enough food and fuel for the fleet's needs makes Adama wary. It is also apparently the largest tylium (fighter fuel) mining facility in that part of the galaxy, as well as a popular gamblers' den, but nobody has ever heard of the place. Adama discovers that Baltar was responsible for performing the initial Carillon survey, and reported that tylium was too minimal for mining, and he immediately smells a Cylon trap.\n\nBut in the meantime, Sire Uri, Adama's self-serving nemesis on the new Council of the Twelve, uses the opportunity the planet presents for the morale of the fugitives to make his move against Adama, whose strict but selflessly benign intentions hinder his own ambitions. The Council of the Twelve, led by Uri to believe the Cylons have been left far behind, propose that the humans pause to celebrate their escape and dismantle their military and weapons to prove to the Cylons that humans are no longer a threat to them. The Council arranges a banquet on Carillon, and orders all fighter pilots to attend. Adama suspects that this might be a golden opportunity for the Cylons to launch an attack on their fleet, and orders Colonel Tigh to surreptitiously hold back their fighter pilots from attending the party while he is to outfit noncombat personnel with fighter uniforms.\n\nDown on Carillon, Apollo and Starbuck gradually discover that something is amiss when they see strangers walking around clad in the uniforms of their squadron, and after some investigation they discover the truth behind the planet's prosperity. The natives of Carillon, the insectoid Ovions, have set up the gambling resort to lure humans to them to serve as living food for their hatching larvae in their underground chambers. They are also secretly in league with the Cylons and mine the tylium solely for their purposes in exchange for their freedom, and they are cooperating in the Cylons' efforts to eradicate the human fugitives. During a subsequent fight with Cylon Centurions, the laser fire from both parties sets the tylium mines on fire, threatening to destroy the planet once the fire rages fully out of control.\n\nAdama's ruse works, and the Cylons, believing that all of the pilots are at the banquet, launch a fighter attack against the ''Galactica'' in orbit, but Adama is ready to spring his trap. Once the Cylon fighter contingent is fully engaged with the ''Galactica'', Adama recalls all his Vipers from the surface of Carillon, taking the enemy by surprise. During the fight, Apollo realizes the Cylon fighters couldn't have come so far without a basestar, and he and Starbuck disengage from the battle and find a Cylon basestar hidden on the far side of Carillon. In defiance of Commander Adama's recall order, they decide to attempt to destroy it, in order to enable the refugee fleet to elude pursuit, and use fake radio chatter to fool the basestar into thinking it's under attack by multiple Viper squadrons. The basestar descends into Carillon's atmosphere to avoid detection, and is destroyed when the planet finally erupts in a massive tylium explosion. However, despite their victory, the humans realize their enemies will still be pursuing them, and they set out to Earth, their last hope for survival.\n\n==Different versions==\nThere have been various versions of the pilot broadcast or released theatrically. Although produced for television, originally as part of a planned series of telemovies and eventually as a television series,<ref name=\"Production\">[http://www.kobol.com/archives/BG-FAQ.html#G1 Battlestar Galactica Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> [[Universal Studios]] decided to release a reedited version theatrically in order to recoup some of the high production costs with producers believing the series \"could be a fine shot at a corner of the ''Star Wars'' market.\"<ref name=\"Production\"/> In July 1978, two months before its U.S. television debut, the film was released in Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, and some countries in Europe and Latin America. The release was a success following an aggressive marketing campaign from Universal<ref name=\"Production\"/> and influenced the decision to release the pilot of ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'' in cinemas a year later. Later episodes of the regular ''Battlestar Galactica'' series were also re-edited and [[List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes#Theatrical releases|released in cinemas internationally]].\n\nAlthough there are many minor differences between the broadcast pilot and the cinema release, the most notable is the fact that, in the film version, Baltar is executed by the Cylons, whereas, in the television version, he is held for public execution before later being shown mercy by the Cylons, and going on to be a major character on the television series.<ref name=\"Differences\">[http://www.kobol.com/archives/bgdiff.html The Different Versions of the Battlestar Galactica Pilot Episode]</ref><ref name=\"Differences2\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077215/alternateversions Battlestar Galactica (1978) (TV) \u2013 Alternate versions]</ref> The made for TV version included a scene of Starbuck & Athena in her quarters, which more significantly established their relationship early in the story. The Cylons in the theater release versions were living creatures in armor suits, not robots (rumor has it the censors allowed them to blow up more Cylon ships on TV if they were robots). There were more aliens in the casino on the planet Carillon in the theater version (the motivation to replace some of the aliens with humans might have been to make it less like the cantina scene in Star Wars). In the theater version there is significant dramatic tension when the audience realizes that all the pilots have been invited to a party on the planet Carillon, and the Cylons are about to attack the fighter pilotless fleet. In a surprise ending we find out that non-pilots have been dressed as pilots, and most of the real pilots are on the Galactica prepped for a counter attack. In the TV version they destroy this dramatic tension by giving away the surprise ending ahead of time with a conversation between Commander Adama and Colonel Tigh, and a scene of Tigh stealing uniforms from pilots' lockers. Another difference was related to TV censorship. In the TV version Starbuck and Cassiopia are sitting beside each other fully clothed in the launch tube, not nude and having sex as they were in the theater version, when Athena sees them on the monitor. The cinema release also made use of Universal's [[Sensurround]] process, and was the last produced film to use it.\n\nThe television version was first broadcast in the United States on September 17, 1978. This original three-hour broadcast was in three U.S. [[Time in the United States|time zones]] interrupted for more than an hour to televise the signing of the [[Camp David Accords|Camp David Peace Accords]] between [[Israel]]'s Menachem Begin and [[Egypt]]'s Anwar Sadat, overseen by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]. Following the coverage, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] resumed the broadcast, right where it was interrupted. In later years, this version has often been separated into three episodes, each an hour long, for syndication.\n\nIn May 1979, following the broadcast of the final episode of the regular series, the overseas theatrical version saw a limited release at select U.S. screens.\n\nIn 1980, the pilot was edited again and syndicated as part of a series of reedited ''Battlestar Galactica'' [[List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes#Television movies|telemovies]].<ref name=\"Telemovie\">[http://www.kobol.com/archives/BG-FAQ.html#G4 Battlestar Galactica Frequently Asked Questions]</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n===DVD===\nBoth the theatrical version and the television version have been released on DVD. The television version was released on the season 1 DVD set, and as part of \"The Complete Epic Series\" boxset containing all episodes of the series. The theatrical version was released in 1999 and then again in 2003 as a \"flipper\" disc with a preview for the then-current ''Battlestar Galactica'' revival and a Cylon DVD game. These releases present the theatrical version in 1.85:1 \"matted\" (non-anamorphic) widescreen,  with the \"Sensurround\" track in Dolby Digital 1.1 Mono.\n\nIn 2013, Koch Media released this version in a three-film DVD set with ''Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack'' and ''Conquest of the Earth''. This DVD release uses HD masters supplied by Universal and all films are presented in 1.37:1 full frame as they were shot in, as opposed to the \"matted\" widescreen 1.85:1 ratio seen theatrically.\n\n===Blu-ray===\n[[Koch Media]] released the entire series in Germany on a Blu-ray set in January 2014. This set contains all the episodes of the series (including ''[[Galactica 1980]]''), utilizing the masters Universal used for their DVD releases, in 1080p with English 5.1 Surround and German mono. This set only contains the full-length TV versions of \"Saga of a Star World\" and the other episodes used to make the films ''Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack'' (from \"The Living Legend\" and \"Fire in Space\"), and ''Conquest of the Earth'' (from \"Galactica Discovers Earth\" and \"The Night the Cylons Landed\"). However, the Koch set does contain the original theatrical trailers for all three films including the [[Super 8 film|Super 8mm]] versions, along with other extras and fan convention material exclusive to that release. In May 2015, Universal released the complete series on Blu-ray in enhanced widescreen and 4:3 versions. The Universal Blu-ray sets carry over most of the extras from the previous \"Complete Epic Series\" DVD set with a few new ones included.\n\nIn February 2013, Universal Home Entertainment released the theatrical version for the first time on Blu-ray in North America with a new, remastered HD transfer in widescreen 1080p, the \"Sensurround\" track in DTS-MA 1.1 Mono, and a preview for ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome]]''. In October 2015, Koch Media released their own Blu-ray of the theatrical version using Universal's HD transfer in widescreen and unmatted 4:3 full frame formats. Extras include the German trailer and vintage German opening credits from a 16mm print.\n\n==Other media==\n* A [[photonovel]] of the film was released in 1979, and is considered a highly prized collector's item. While much of this demand was due to each image on each page being taken directly from the actual 35mm film cells, compounding the value was the scarcity of intact copies; the glossy paper used for the print stock did not adhere well to the spine glue, and after several reads the binding tended to fall apart. This was further compounded as the glue became brittle with age.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n* [[Stu Phillips (composer)|Stu Phillips]]' soundtrack to the pilot, as performed by the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] has been released on various occasions in the past, including a re-recorded LP, released in 1978 by [[MCA Records]] around the time of the film's TV debut.

In the TV version Starbuck and Cassiopia are sitting beside each other fully clothed in the launch tube, not nude and having sex as they were in the theater version, when Athena sees them on the monitor. The cinema release also made use of Universal's [[Sensurround]] process, and was the last produced film to use it.\n\nThe television version was first broadcast in the United States on September 17, 1978. This original three-hour broadcast was in three U.S. [[Time in the United States|time zones]] interrupted for more than an hour to televise the signing of the [[Camp David Accords|Camp David Peace Accords]] between [[Israel]]'s Menachem Begin and [[Egypt]]'s Anwar Sadat, overseen by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]. Following the coverage, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] resumed the broadcast, right where it was interrupted. In later years, this version has often been separated into three episodes, each an hour long, for syndication.\n\nIn May 1979, following the broadcast of the final episode of the regular series, the overseas theatrical version saw a limited release at select U.S. screens.\n\nIn 1980, the pilot was edited again and syndicated as part of a series of reedited ''Battlestar Galactica'' [[List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes#Television movies|telemovies]].<ref name=\"Telemovie\">[http://www.kobol.com/archives/BG-FAQ.html#G4 Battlestar Galactica Frequently Asked Questions]</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n===DVD===\nBoth the theatrical version and the television version have been released on DVD. The television version was released on the season 1 DVD set, and as part of \"The Complete Epic Series\" boxset containing all episodes of the series. The theatrical version was released in 1999 and then again in 2003 as a \"flipper\" disc with a preview for the then-current ''Battlestar Galactica'' revival and a Cylon DVD game. These releases present the theatrical version in 1.85:1 \"matted\" (non-anamorphic) widescreen,  with the \"Sensurround\" track in Dolby Digital 1.1 Mono.\n\nIn 2013, Koch Media released this version in a three-film DVD set with ''Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack'' and ''Conquest of the Earth''. This DVD release uses HD masters supplied by Universal and all films are presented in 1.37:1 full frame as they were shot in, as opposed to the \"matted\" widescreen 1.85:1 ratio seen theatrically.\n\n===Blu-ray===\n[[Koch Media]] released the entire series in Germany on a Blu-ray set in January 2014. This set contains all the episodes of the series (including ''[[Galactica 1980]]''), utilizing the masters Universal used for their DVD releases, in 1080p with English 5.1 Surround and German mono. This set only contains the full-length TV versions of \"Saga of a Star World\" and the other episodes used to make the films ''Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack'' (from \"The Living Legend\" and \"Fire in Space\"), and ''Conquest of the Earth'' (from \"Galactica Discovers Earth\" and \"The Night the Cylons Landed\"). However, the Koch set does contain the original theatrical trailers for all three films including the [[Super 8 film|Super 8mm]] versions, along with other extras and fan convention material exclusive to that release. In May 2015, Universal released the complete series on Blu-ray in enhanced widescreen and 4:3 versions. The Universal Blu-ray sets carry over most of the extras from the previous \"Complete Epic Series\" DVD set with a few new ones included.\n\nIn February 2013, Universal Home Entertainment released the theatrical version for the first time on Blu-ray in North America with a new, remastered HD transfer in widescreen 1080p, the \"Sensurround\" track in DTS-MA 1.1 Mono, and a preview for ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome]]''. In October 2015, Koch Media released their own Blu-ray of the theatrical version using Universal's HD transfer in widescreen and unmatted 4:3 full frame formats. Extras include the German trailer and vintage German opening credits from a 16mm print.\n\n==Other media==\n* A [[photonovel]] of the film was released in 1979, and is considered a highly prized collector's item. While much of this demand was due to each image on each page being taken directly from the actual 35mm film cells, compounding the value was the scarcity of intact copies; the glossy paper used for the print stock did not adhere well to the spine glue, and after several reads the binding tended to fall apart. This was further compounded as the glue became brittle with age.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n* [[Stu Phillips (composer)|Stu Phillips]]' soundtrack to the pilot, as performed by the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] has been released on various occasions in the past, including a re-recorded LP, released in 1978 by [[MCA Records]] around the time of the film's TV debut.  This was followed by a dedicated CD in the boxset entitled ''The Stu Phillips Anthology \u2013 Battlestar Galactica'' containing the original film tracks for the first time.<ref>http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Soundtrack_%28Original_TV_Soundtrack%29<br>http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Soundtrack_%28The_Stu_Phillips_Anthology_-_Battlestar_Galactica%29</ref> In 1999, it was also re-recorded by the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]], conducted by Phillips himself, and issued on CD.<ref>[http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Soundtrack_%281978_Film%29 Soundtrack (1978 Film) \u2013 Battlestar Wiki]</ref> It was issued again in February 2011, by [[Intrada Records]] featuring the complete score as recorded for the film by the Los Angeles Philharmonic.<ref>[http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.6865/.f BATTLESTAR GALACTICA VOL. 1]</ref>\n* A paperback novelization of the film was published in 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=Battlestar Galactica |url=https://archive.org/details/battlestargalact00lars |url-access=registration |last=Larson |first=Glen |author2=Robert Thurston  |date=September 1978 |edition=Berkley |publisher=Berkley Publishing Co. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-425-03958-7}}</ref>\n* The story was adapted into [[Battlestar Galactica (comics)#Marvel Comics|comic book]] form by [[Marvel Comics]], first in a magazine format, then later in both tabloid format and as a trade paperback.\n* An audio drama version was created by editing the film's mono sound and adding narration voiced by Lorne Greene and released on MCA Records in 1979 under the title \"The Saga of Battlestar Galactica\", Catalog #3078. The vinyl version features a gatefold sleeve with liner notes. It runs approx. 50 minutes.\n\n==Re-imaginings==\n\n===2003 television version===\n* The plot of Part I formed the primary plot of the reimagined [[Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|''Battlestar Galactica'' miniseries]], in which the Twelve Colonies are destroyed, and the survivors set out for Earth.\n* The reimagined series episode \"[[The Passage (Battlestar Galactica)|The Passage]]\" is loosely based on the plot of Part II, in which the fleet must navigate through a radiation belt.\n\n===Upcoming Battlestar Galactica film===\nDirector [[Bryan Singer]] stated that the [[Battlestar Galactica#Feature film|planned ''Battlestar Galactica'' feature film]] would be based on this part of the 1978 television series, but would not be a direct adaptation. However, Singer is no longer attached to the project, and subsequent scripts may no longer reflect this.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0077215}}\n* {{Amg title|4357}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|battlestar_galactica}}\n* [http://www.galactica.tv/battlestar-galactica-1978-news/storyboards-of-saga-of-a-star-world-part-1.html Storyboard of \"Saga\" at galactica.tv]\n\n{{Battlestar Galactica}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Battlestar Galactica (1978) episodes]]\n[[Category:1978 films]]\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:1970s science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard A.
