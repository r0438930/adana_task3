There is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or were brought as slaves. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, in which the [[Romanians]] took the Roma as slaves from the [[Mongols]] and preserved their status to use their labor. Other historians believe that the Romani were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving war prisoners may also have been adopted from the Mongols.<ref name=Achim />{{Page needed |date=September 2015}}\n\nSome Romani may have been slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, but most of them migrated from south of the [[Danube]] at the end of the 14th century, some time after the [[foundation of Wallachia]]. By then, the institution of slavery was already established in Moldavia and possibly in both principalities. After the Roma migrated into the area, slavery became a widespread practice by the majority population. The [[Tatars|Tatar]] slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.<ref>{{Citation |first = \u0218tefan |last = \u0218tef\u0103nescu |title = Istoria medie a Rom\u00e2niei |volume = I |publisher = Editura Universit\u0103\u021bii din Bucure\u0219ti |place = Bucharest |year = 1991 |language = ro }}</ref>\n\nSome branches of the Romani people reached Western Europe in the 15th century, fleeing as refugees from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Balkans.<ref>{{cite news |title = Gypsy/Roma European migrations from 15th century till nowadays |url = https://www.academia.edu/1132677 |work = academia.edu |date = }}</ref> Although the Romani were refugees from the conflicts in southeastern Europe, they were often suspected by certain populations in the West of being associated with the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion]] because their physical appearance seemed Turkish.

Reviewing the situation in 2012, one Belgian magazine observed:{{quote|On International Roma Day, which falls on 8 April, the significant proportion of Europe's 12 million Roma who live in deplorable conditions will not have much to celebrate. And poverty is not the only worry for the community. Ethnic tensions are on the rise. In 2008, Roma camps came under attack in Italy, intimidation by racist parliamentarians is the norm in Hungary. Speaking in 1993, [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] prophetically remarked that \"the treatment of the Roma is a [[litmus test (politics)|Litmus test]] for democracy\": and democracy has been found wanting. The consequences of the transition to capitalism have been disastrous for the Roma. Under communism they had jobs, free housing and schooling. Now many are unemployed, many are losing their homes and racism is increasingly rewarded with impunity.<ref name=\"MO 2012\">{{cite web |url = http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1757331-bleak-horizon |title = Bleak horizon |first = Hellen |last = Kooijman |place = EU |date = 6 April 2012 |publisher = Presseurop |accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe 2016 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research poll]] found that Italians, in particular, hold strong anti-Roma views, with 82% of Italians expressing negative opinions about Roma.

There is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or were brought as slaves. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, in which the [[Romanians]] took the Roma as slaves from the [[Mongols]] and preserved their status to use their labor. Other historians believe that the Romani were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving war prisoners may also have been adopted from the Mongols.<ref name=Achim />{{Page needed |date=September 2015}}\n\nSome Romani may have been slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, but most of them migrated from south of the [[Danube]] at the end of the 14th century, some time after the [[foundation of Wallachia]]. By then, the institution of slavery was already established in Moldavia and possibly in both principalities. After the Roma migrated into the area, slavery became a widespread practice by the majority population. The [[Tatars|Tatar]] slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.<ref>{{Citation |first = \u0218tefan |last = \u0218tef\u0103nescu |title = Istoria medie a Rom\u00e2niei |volume = I |publisher = Editura Universit\u0103\u021bii din Bucure\u0219ti |place = Bucharest |year = 1991 |language = ro }}</ref>\n\nSome branches of the Romani people reached Western Europe in the 15th century, fleeing as refugees from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Balkans.<ref>{{cite news |title = Gypsy/Roma European migrations from 15th century till nowadays |url = https://www.academia.edu/1132677 |work = academia.edu |date = }}</ref> Although the Romani were refugees from the conflicts in southeastern Europe, they were often suspected by certain populations in the West of being associated with the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion]] because their physical appearance seemed Turkish.

Reviewing the situation in 2012, one Belgian magazine observed:{{quote|On International Roma Day, which falls on 8 April, the significant proportion of Europe's 12 million Roma who live in deplorable conditions will not have much to celebrate. And poverty is not the only worry for the community. Ethnic tensions are on the rise. In 2008, Roma camps came under attack in Italy, intimidation by racist parliamentarians is the norm in Hungary. Speaking in 1993, [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] prophetically remarked that \"the treatment of the Roma is a [[litmus test (politics)|Litmus test]] for democracy\": and democracy has been found wanting. The consequences of the transition to capitalism have been disastrous for the Roma. Under communism they had jobs, free housing and schooling. Now many are unemployed, many are losing their homes and racism is increasingly rewarded with impunity.<ref name=\"MO 2012\">{{cite web |url = http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1757331-bleak-horizon |title = Bleak horizon |first = Hellen |last = Kooijman |place = EU |date = 6 April 2012 |publisher = Presseurop |accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe 2016 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research poll]] found that Italians, in particular, hold strong anti-Roma views, with 82% of Italians expressing negative opinions about Roma.
