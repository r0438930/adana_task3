Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album covers. It is a patchwork of 25 squares: 22 squares showing different coloured images placed around three squares forming the word \"WHO\" in the centre of the album cover. The 22 squares depict some of the band's influences and symbols of their career and culture: \n*The [[Union Jack]] flag.\n*A red [[Routemaster bus]] (referring to both their 1968 single \"[[Magic Bus (song)|Magic Bus]]\" and its accompanying compilation album ''[[Magic Bus: The Who on Tour]]'').\n*A [[Royal Air Force roundels|Royal Air Force roundel]].\n*Baked beans (a reminiscence of the band's own 1967 ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' album cover).\n*A [[pinball]] machine (a reminiscence of the band's own 1969 track \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\").\n*The band's 1979 ''[[The Kids Are Alright (soundtrack)|The Kids Are Alright]]'' release advertisement poster featuring lead guitarist [[Pete Townshend]] on stage about to smash his Gibson Les Paul guitar, with the classic caption \"This guitar has seconds to live.\"<ref name=\"feelnumb.com The Who This guitar has seconds to live\">{{cite web |url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2012/03/12/pete-townshend-this-guitar-has-seconds-to-live-guitar/ |title=Pete Townshend \"This Guitar Has Seconds To Live\" The Who Ad |date= September 2019 |website=www.feelnumb.com |accessdate= 3 October 2019}}</ref> \n*A [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] (a nod to the [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] culture and therefore, a reminiscence of the band's own 1973 ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' album cover showing a mod scooter).\n*The band's 1981 ''[[Face Dances]]'' cassette edition album cover.<ref name=\"discogs.com The Who Face Dances cassette edition\">{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Who-Face-Dances/release/5512303 |title= The Who \u2013 Face Dances (cassette edition) |date= September 2019 |website=discogs.com |accessdate= 3 October 2019}}</ref> \n*Comic book characters [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (the band covered [[Neal Hefti]]'s Batman theme on their first E.P. ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'' released in 1966).\n*Cultural figures such as musician [[Chuck Berry]] and boxer [[Muhammad Ali]].\n*A traffic sign reading \"Detour\", which is the fourth track on the album and a reference to the band's earlier name, The Detours.\n\n==Reception==\n''WHO'' has received generally positive reviews from critics and fans alike. According to ''Metacritic'' scores, fans gave the album a 7.5/10 star rating, while critics gave the album a 79/100 score.<ref>https://www.metacritic.com/music/who/the-who</ref> Praise for the band's performance also resonated with critics. In the ''Chicago Tribune,'' Pablo Gorondi complimented Daltrey for, \"sing(ing) with power, sensitivity, range and conviction, just as he has done for decades,\" and called Townshend's voice a \"highlight,\" while still \"rip(ping) power chords and perform(ing) slinky riffs.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref> Gorondi continued his praise by stating that the dominant reasons why the album was \"such a joy\" were due to \"Townshend's songwriting and guitar playing and Daltrey's superlative singing.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref>\n\nConceptually, the album tackles the struggles of being an elderly rock musician, as ''Guardian'' writer, Alexis Petridis noted. \"Townshend seems more troubled than ever,\" Petridis stated, and this feeling overlaps into songs such as \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise,\" which according to Petridis, \"...views a rock career as one of inevitable decline.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/28/the-who-who-review-back-and-still-causing-a-big-sensation</ref> Musically, the album sounds like a \"traditional\" Who record. ''Senior Rolling Stone'' writer, Kory Grow, called ''WHO'',\"classic rock comfort food\" and commented on the its nostalgic feel: \"...Townshend and Daltrey...can still summon their inner Who-ness in their mid 70s.\"<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-who-who-review-919564/</ref> Likewise, ''Ultimate Classic Rock'''s senior editor, Michael Gallucci, reflected on how the band's newest album sounds more like a \"conventional\" Who record, despite the album being thematically different from any of their previous works: \"It's a throwback record for the most part, with nods all over the place to their classic work. It's not a retread, but it sounds like a Who album, which is crucial for something like this, as well as an upgrade for the 21st century.\"<ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-who-who-album-review/</ref>\n\nDespite the praises for its 1970s rock sound and Daltrey and Townshend's performances, ''WHO'' has received criticism. According to Matthew Taub of ''Consequence of Sound'', some tracks are \"not particularly well conceived,\" citing songs such as \"Detour\" and \"Hero Ground Zero,\" as \"just sit(ting) there\" or \"feeling more like an intermission.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Taub also commented that the track, \"Break the News,\" which was written by Townshend's younger brother, Simon, sounded like it was, \"plucked from some kind of factory for generic acoustic pop songs \u2014 somehow like 100 other songs you\u2019ve heard, yet none you can actually name.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Another complaint was the generational tone of the album. Chris Willman from ''Variety'' stated,\"There are hints of mirth amid the crotchetiness. Right in the opening line, when Daltrey sings \u201cI don\u2019t care, I know you\u2019re gonna hate this song,\u201d followed later by \u201cI don\u2019t mind other guys ripping off my song.\u201d\"<ref>https://variety.com/2019/music/news/the-who-album-review-1203426754/</ref> ''New Musical Express'' journalist, Mark Beaumont, similarly noted this theme with the track, \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise\": \"...(it) almost reads like a 75-year-old Daltrey talking to the drunk and tardy 20-year-old who sang 'My Generation.'\"<ref>https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/the-who-who-review-13-years-since-their-last-album-this-stands-up-alongside-their-classics-2580985</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Pete Townshend]] except where noted.\n{{Track listing\n| title1 = All This Music Must Fade\n| length1 = 3:20\n| title2 = [[Ball and Chain (The Who song)|Ball and Chain]]\n| length2 = 4:29\n| title3 = I Don't Wanna Get Wise\n| length3 = 3:54\n| title4 = Detour\n| length4 = 3:46\n| title5 = Beads on One String\n| length5 = 3:40\n| note5 = Pete Townshend and Josh Hunsaker\n| title6 = Hero Ground Zero\n| length6 = 4:52\n| title7 = Street Song\n| length7 = 4:47\n| title8 = I'll Be Back\n| length8 = 5:01\n| title9 = Break the News\n| length9 = 4:30\n| note9 = [[Simon Townshend]]\n| title10 = Rockin' in Rage\n| length10 = 4:04\n| title11 = She Rocked My World\n| length11 = 3:22\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = no\n| headline = Deluxe edition bonus tracks\n| title12 = This Gun Will Misfire\n| length12 = 3:36\n| title13 = Got Nothing to Prove\n| length13 = 3:38\n| title14 = Danny and My Ponies\n| length14 = 4:02\n| title15 = Sand\n| length15 = 4:27\n| note15 = Demo, Japan only\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\nAdapted from compact disc liner notes and online liner notes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Who-Who/release/14492734|title=The Who - Who|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n===The Who===\n*[[Pete Townshend]]: guitars, backing vocals, lead vocals (tracks 8, 12\u201314), harmonicas, percussion, synthesizer tracks, violin, cello, hurdy-gurdy, effects, orchestration (6)\n*[[Roger Daltrey]]: lead vocals (except 8, 12\u201314)\n\n===Additional personnel===\n*[[Pino Palladino]]: bass (1-2, 4-8, 11-12)\n*[[Zak Starkey]]: drums (1-2, 4, 7)\n*[[Simon Townshend]]: percussion\n*[[Dave Sardy]]: percussion, mellotron, synthesizer programming (5)\n*[[Joey Waronker]]: drums (5, 8, 11-12)\n*[[Benmont Tench]]: organ, mellotron\n*Gus Seyffert: bass (3, 9-10)\n*[[Carla Azar]]: drums (3, 10)\n*[[Matt Chamberlain]]: drums (6)\n*Josh Tyrrell: handclaps (4)\n*Rowan McIntosh: handclaps (4)\n*Martin Batchelar: programming (6), orchestration (6, 8), orchestra arrangement (8), orchestra conducting (6, 8, 13)\n*[[Rachel Fuller]]: orchestration (6)\n*Peter Rotter: orchestra fixer (6, 8, 13)\n*Bruce Dukov: orchestra leader (6, 8, 13)\n*Andrew Synowiec: acoustic guitar (9)\n*[[Gordon Giltrap]]: acoustic guitar (11)\n*Fergus Gerrand: percussion (11)\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album covers. It is a patchwork of 25 squares: 22 squares showing different coloured images placed around three squares forming the word \"WHO\" in the centre of the album cover. The 22 squares depict some of the band's influences and symbols of their career and culture: \n*The [[Union Jack]] flag.\n*A red [[Routemaster bus]] (referring to both their 1968 single \"[[Magic Bus (song)|Magic Bus]]\" and its accompanying compilation album ''[[Magic Bus: The Who on Tour]]'').\n*A [[Royal Air Force roundels|Royal Air Force roundel]].\n*Baked beans (a reminiscence of the band's own 1967 ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' album cover).\n*A [[pinball]] machine (a reminiscence of the band's own 1969 track \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\").\n*The band's 1979 ''[[The Kids Are Alright (soundtrack)|The Kids Are Alright]]'' release advertisement poster featuring lead guitarist [[Pete Townshend]] on stage about to smash his Gibson Les Paul guitar, with the classic caption \"This guitar has seconds to live.\"<ref name=\"feelnumb.com The Who This guitar has seconds to live\">{{cite web |url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2012/03/12/pete-townshend-this-guitar-has-seconds-to-live-guitar/ |title=Pete Townshend \"This Guitar Has Seconds To Live\" The Who Ad |date= September 2019 |website=www.feelnumb.com |accessdate= 3 October 2019}}</ref> \n*A [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] (a nod to the [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] culture and therefore, a reminiscence of the band's own 1973 ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' album cover showing a mod scooter).\n*The band's 1981 ''[[Face Dances]]'' cassette edition album cover.<ref name=\"discogs.com The Who Face Dances cassette edition\">{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Who-Face-Dances/release/5512303 |title= The Who \u2013 Face Dances (cassette edition) |date= September 2019 |website=discogs.com |accessdate= 3 October 2019}}</ref> \n*Comic book characters [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (the band covered [[Neal Hefti]]'s Batman theme on their first E.P.

According to ''Metacritic'' scores, fans gave the album a 7.5/10 star rating, while critics gave the album a 79/100 score.<ref>https://www.metacritic.com/music/who/the-who</ref> Praise for the band's performance also resonated with critics. In the ''Chicago Tribune,'' Pablo Gorondi complimented Daltrey for, \"sing(ing) with power, sensitivity, range and conviction, just as he has done for decades,\" and called Townshend's voice a \"highlight,\" while still \"rip(ping) power chords and perform(ing) slinky riffs.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref> Gorondi continued his praise by stating that the dominant reasons why the album was \"such a joy\" were due to \"Townshend's songwriting and guitar playing and Daltrey's superlative singing.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref>\n\nConceptually, the album tackles the struggles of being an elderly rock musician, as ''Guardian'' writer, Alexis Petridis noted. \"Townshend seems more troubled than ever,\" Petridis stated, and this feeling overlaps into songs such as \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise,\" which according to Petridis, \"...views a rock career as one of inevitable decline.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/28/the-who-who-review-back-and-still-causing-a-big-sensation</ref> Musically, the album sounds like a \"traditional\" Who record. ''Senior Rolling Stone'' writer, Kory Grow, called ''WHO'',\"classic rock comfort food\" and commented on the its nostalgic feel: \"...Townshend and Daltrey...can still summon their inner Who-ness in their mid 70s.\"<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-who-who-review-919564/</ref> Likewise, ''Ultimate Classic Rock'''s senior editor, Michael Gallucci, reflected on how the band's newest album sounds more like a \"conventional\" Who record, despite the album being thematically different from any of their previous works: \"It's a throwback record for the most part, with nods all over the place to their classic work. It's not a retread, but it sounds like a Who album, which is crucial for something like this, as well as an upgrade for the 21st century.\"<ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-who-who-album-review/</ref>\n\nDespite the praises for its 1970s rock sound and Daltrey and Townshend's performances, ''WHO'' has received criticism. According to Matthew Taub of ''Consequence of Sound'', some tracks are \"not particularly well conceived,\" citing songs such as \"Detour\" and \"Hero Ground Zero,\" as \"just sit(ting) there\" or \"feeling more like an intermission.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Taub also commented that the track, \"Break the News,\" which was written by Townshend's younger brother, Simon, sounded like it was, \"plucked from some kind of factory for generic acoustic pop songs \u2014 somehow like 100 other songs you\u2019ve heard, yet none you can actually name.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Another complaint was the generational tone of the album. Chris Willman from ''Variety'' stated,\"There are hints of mirth amid the crotchetiness. Right in the opening line, when Daltrey sings \u201cI don\u2019t care, I know you\u2019re gonna hate this song,\u201d followed later by \u201cI don\u2019t mind other guys ripping off my song.\u201d\"<ref>https://variety.com/2019/music/news/the-who-album-review-1203426754/</ref> ''New Musical Express'' journalist, Mark Beaumont, similarly noted this theme with the track, \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise\": \"...(it) almost reads like a 75-year-old Daltrey talking to the drunk and tardy 20-year-old who sang 'My Generation.'\"<ref>https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/the-who-who-review-13-years-since-their-last-album-this-stands-up-alongside-their-classics-2580985</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Pete Townshend]] except where noted.\n{{Track listing\n| title1 = All This Music Must Fade\n| length1 = 3:20\n| title2 = [[Ball and Chain (The Who song)|Ball and Chain]]\n| length2 = 4:29\n| title3 = I Don't Wanna Get Wise\n| length3 = 3:54\n| title4 = Detour\n| length4 = 3:46\n| title5 = Beads on One String\n| length5 = 3:40\n| note5 = Pete Townshend and Josh Hunsaker\n| title6 = Hero Ground Zero\n| length6 = 4:52\n| title7 = Street Song\n| length7 = 4:47\n| title8 = I'll Be Back\n| length8 = 5:01\n| title9 = Break the News\n| length9 = 4:30\n| note9 = [[Simon Townshend]]\n| title10 = Rockin' in Rage\n| length10 = 4:04\n| title11 = She Rocked My World\n| length11 = 3:22\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = no\n| headline = Deluxe edition bonus tracks\n| title12 = This Gun Will Misfire\n| length12 = 3:36\n| title13 = Got Nothing to Prove\n| length13 = 3:38\n| title14 = Danny and My Ponies\n| length14 = 4:02\n| title15 = Sand\n| length15 = 4:27\n| note15 = Demo, Japan only\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\nAdapted from compact disc liner notes and online liner notes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Who-Who/release/14492734|title=The Who - Who|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n===The Who===\n*[[Pete Townshend]]: guitars, backing vocals, lead vocals (tracks 8, 12\u201314), harmonicas, percussion, synthesizer tracks, violin, cello, hurdy-gurdy, effects, orchestration (6)\n*[[Roger Daltrey]]: lead vocals (except 8, 12\u201314)\n\n===Additional personnel===\n*[[Pino Palladino]]: bass (1-2, 4-8, 11-12)\n*[[Zak Starkey]]: drums (1-2, 4, 7)\n*[[Simon Townshend]]: percussion\n*[[Dave Sardy]]: percussion, mellotron, synthesizer programming (5)\n*[[Joey Waronker]]: drums (5, 8, 11-12)\n*[[Benmont Tench]]: organ, mellotron\n*Gus Seyffert: bass (3, 9-10)\n*[[Carla Azar]]: drums (3, 10)\n*[[Matt Chamberlain]]: drums (6)\n*Josh Tyrrell: handclaps (4)\n*Rowan McIntosh: handclaps (4)\n*Martin Batchelar: programming (6), orchestration (6, 8), orchestra arrangement (8), orchestra conducting (6, 8, 13)\n*[[Rachel Fuller]]: orchestration (6)\n*Peter Rotter: orchestra fixer (6, 8, 13)\n*Bruce Dukov: orchestra leader (6, 8, 13)\n*Andrew Synowiec: acoustic guitar (9)\n*[[Gordon Giltrap]]: acoustic guitar (11)\n*Fergus Gerrand: percussion (11)\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
