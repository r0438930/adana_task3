See [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]], [[bowling]].\n\n==Kinetic projectiles==\n\n{{See also|Kinetic energy penetrator|Terminal ballistics#Hypervelocity|l2=Terminal ballistics \u2013 Hypervelocity|Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle}}\nA projectile that does not contain an explosive charge or any other kind of payload is termed a ''kinetic projectile'', ''kinetic energy weapon'', ''kinetic energy warhead'', ''kinetic warhead'', ''kinetic kill vehicle'' or ''kinetic penetrator''. Typical kinetic energy weapons are blunt projectiles such as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[round shot]]s, pointed ones such as [[arrow]]s, and somewhat pointed ones such as [[bullet]]s. Among projectiles that do not contain explosives are those launched from [[railgun]]s, [[coilgun]]s, and [[mass driver]]s, as well as [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s. All of these weapons work by attaining a high [[muzzle velocity]], or initial velocity, generally up to ([[hypervelocity]]), and [[collision|collide]] with their targets, converting their [[kinetic energy]] into destructive shock waves and heat. Other types of kinetic weapons are accelerated over time by a rocket engine, or by gravity. In either case, it is the [[kinetic energy]] of the projectile that destroys its target.\n\nSome kinetic weapons for targeting objects in [[spaceflight]] are [[anti-satellite weapon]]s and [[anti-ballistic missile]]s. Since in order to reach an object in orbit it is necessary to attain an extremely high velocity, their released kinetic energy alone is enough to destroy their target; explosives are not necessary. For example: the energy of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] is 4.6&nbsp;MJ/kg, and the energy of a kinetic kill vehicle with a closing speed of {{cvt|10|km/s|mph|||}} is 50&nbsp;MJ/kg. This saves costly weight and there is no [[detonation]] to be precisely timed. This method, however, requires direct contact with the target, which requires a more accurate [[trajectory]]. Some hit-to-kill warheads are additionally equipped with an explosive directional warhead to enhance the kill probability (e.g. Israeli [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow]] missile or U.S. [[MIM-104 Patriot#MIM-104F (PAC-3)|Patriot PAC-3]]).\n\nWith regard to anti-missile weapons, the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]] and [[MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2]] have explosives, while the [[Kinetic Energy Interceptor]] (KEI), [[Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile]] (LEAP, used in [[Aegis BMDS]]), and [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD]] do not (see [[Missile Defense Agency]]).\n\nA kinetic projectile can also be dropped from aircraft. This is applied by replacing the explosives of a regular bomb with a non-explosive material (e.g. concrete), for a precision hit with less [[collateral damage]]. A typical bomb has a mass of {{cvt|900|kg||||}} and a speed of impact of {{cvt|800|kph||||}}. It is also applied for training the act of dropping a bomb with explosives. [http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1999/10/991007-iraq.htm] This method has been used in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and the subsequent military operations in [[Iraq]] by mating concrete-filled training bombs with [[JDAM]] [[GPS]] guidance kits, to attack vehicles and other relatively \"soft\" targets located too close to civilian structures for the use of conventional [[high explosive]] bombs.\n\nA [[Prompt Global Strike]] may use a kinetic weapon. A [[kinetic bombardment]] may involve a projectile dropped from Earth orbit.\n\nA hypothetical kinetic weapon that travels at a significant fraction of the speed of light, usually found in science fiction, is termed a relativistic kill vehicle (RKV).\n\n==Wired projectiles==\nSome projectiles stay connected by a cable to the launch equipment after launching it:\n* for guidance: [[wire-guided missile]] (range up to {{convert|4000|m|disp=or|||}})\n* to administer an electric shock, as in the case of a [[Taser]] (range up to {{convert|10.6|m|disp=or|||}}); two projectiles are shot simultaneously, each with a cable.\n* to make a connection with the target, either to tow it towards the launcher, as with a whaling [[harpoon]], or to draw the launcher to the target, as a [[grappling hook]] does.\n*[[Shotgun#Novelty_and_other|Bolo round]]\n\n==Typical projectile speeds==\n{{disputed section|date=December 2018}}\n{{see also|Orders of magnitude (speed)|Muzzle velocity}}\n<!--the 1m fall is incorrect... it'll be moving 9.8m/s after moving 4.905meters.. not 1-->\n<!--i changed the 1m fall  v=g*t with t=sqrt(2s/g) -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=2 | Projectile\n!colspan=4 | [[Speed]]\n!rowspan=2 | [[Specific kinetic energy]] (J/kg)\n|-\n!(m/s) !!

Time to reach maximum height. It is symbolized as (t), which is the time taken for the projectile to reach the maximum height from the plane of projection. Mathematically, it is given as t=USin(teta)/g \nwhere g=acceleration due to gravity(app 9.81m/s\u00b2), \nU= initial velocity (m/s) and\nteta= angle made by the projectile with the horizontal axis.\n\n2. Time of flight (T): this is the total time taken for the projectile to fall back to the same plane from which it was projected. Mathematically it is given as T=2USin(teta)/g.\n\n3. Maximum Height (H): this is the maximum height attained by the projectile OR the maximum displacement on the vertical axis(y-axis) covered by the projectile.\nIt is given as \nH= U\u00b2Sin\u00b2(teta)/2g.\n\n4.

The vertical component of the velocity on the y-axis is given as Vy=USin(teta) while the horizontal component of the velocity is Vx=UCos(teta).\nThere are various calculations for projectiles at a specific angle teta:\n\n1. Time to reach maximum height. It is symbolized as (t), which is the time taken for the projectile to reach the maximum height from the plane of projection. Mathematically, it is given as t=USin(teta)/g \nwhere g=acceleration due to gravity(app 9.81m/s\u00b2), \nU= initial velocity (m/s) and\nteta= angle made by the projectile with the horizontal axis.\n\n2. Time of flight (T): this is the total time taken for the projectile to fall back to the same plane from which it was projected. Mathematically it is given as T=2USin(teta)/g.\n\n3. Maximum Height (H): this is the maximum height attained by the projectile OR the maximum displacement on the vertical axis(y-axis) covered by the projectile.\nIt is given as \nH= U\u00b2Sin\u00b2(teta)/2g.\n\n4. Range(R): The Range of a projectile is the horizontal distance covered (on the x-axis) by the projectile.\nMathematically,\nR= U\u00b2Sin2(teta)/g.\nThe Range is maximum when angle teta= 45\u00b0 i.e. Sin2(teta)=1.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Atlatl]]\n* [[Ballistics]]\n* [[Gunpowder]]\n* [[Bullet]]\n* [[Impact depth]]\n* [[Kinetic bombardment]]\n* [[Shell (projectile)]]\n* [[Projectile point]]\n* [[Projectile use by animals]]\n* [[Arrow]]\n* [[Dart (missile)|Dart]]\n* [[Missile]]\n* [[Sling (weapon)#Ammunition|Sling ammunition]]\n* [[Spear]]\n* [[Torpedo]]\n* [[Range of a projectile]]\n* [[Space debris]]\n* [[Trajectory of a projectile]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book|author=Heidi Knecht|title=Projectile Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zS2SBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Semyonov+chahars&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjhNW8xInKAhWDRiYKHQJAC4YQ6AEIXTAI#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=29 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4899-1851-2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Projectiles}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://www.phy.ntnu.edu.tw/ntnujava/htmltag.php?code=users.sgeducation.lookang.Projectile02_pkg.Projectile02Applet.class&name=Projectile02&muid=14019  Open Source Physics computer model]\n* [http://www.physics-lab.net/applets/projectile-motion Projectile Motion Applet]\n* [http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109N/more_stuff/Applets/ProjectileMotion/jarapplet.html Another projectile Motion Applet]\n\n[[Category:Projectiles| ]]\n[[Category:Ammunition]]\n[[Category:Ballistics]]\n", "name_user": "Inc", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEquations of motion:{{main|Projectile motion}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile"}
