Later, the protective role of the river basin gave way to economic needs.

on the south of the [[East European Plain]]. It originates in the [[Central Russian Upland]], north of [[Belgorod]], flows south-east through [[Ukraine]] ([[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkiv]], [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]]s) and then again through [[Russia]] ([[Rostov Oblast]]) to join the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Sea of Azov]]. The Donets is the [[List of rivers of Ukraine|fourth longest river]] in Ukraine and the biggest in the [[Eastern Ukraine]]. It is an important source of fresh water in the east of the country. It gives its name to the [[Donets Basin]], known commonly as the Donbass, an important coal mining region in Ukraine.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Don'' and its diminutive, ''Donets'' are derived from [[Iranic]], [[Sarmatian language|Sarmatian]] {{lang|xsc-Latn|D\u0101nu}} \"the river\".<ref name=\"Mallory, J.P 2000. p. 106\">Mallory, J.P. and Victor H.
