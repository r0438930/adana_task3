In October [[1875]], his play \"Cr\u00e2ne et cervelle\" was read before an audience in Quebec. The work, which tells the story of a medical student who steals corpses to dissect them and who falls on the remains of his own fianc\u00e9e, is scandalous.

This collection, inspired by [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]] but with accents [[Paul Verlaine|verlainiens]], still scandalizes the conservative literary milieu of [[Quebec]] at the time. The ruthless and unfair criticism of [[Jules-Paul Tardivel]] in particular closes doors for him and drives his friends away. He lost his job and even the support of Joseph Marmette. Thus dissuaded from going further in his career, unemployed, \u00c9vanturel went into exile in [[United States]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] where he founded a French-language newspaper. He married in Quebec in [[1884]] Esther Casgrain and returned to settle in Quebec in [[1887]] where he died in [[1919]].\n\nThe author only publishes a few isolated poems thereafter. He was however one of the first to deal with themes different from those in force at the time: wide open spaces, patriotic impulses, glorification of God, etc. \u00c9vanturel tackles rather subjects which strike the ambient conservatism. He takes an observer position on art, love, death, the middle classes, social disparities, sadness, scenes of private life, etc. In this sense, he appears to be a pioneer who sought to break conventions. His work is still unknown, but he is nonetheless one of the most sensitive, original and inspired poets of Quebec before [[\u00c9mile Nelligan|Nelligan]].\n\nHe is buried in [[Cimeti\u00e8re Notre-Dame-de-Belmont]], in [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]].\n\n== Source ==\n* '''Notre premier po\u00e8te maudit''' (''English: Our first cursed poet''), article by [[Gilles Laporte (historian)|Gilles Laporte]] in ''[[L\u00e9gendes d'un peuple]]: tome 2'' (''English: Legends of a people''), Les disques Gavroche, 2012, p. 76-81, {{ISBN|9782981359018}}.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Authority}}\n* [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6102792q.r=Eudore+Evanturel.langFR First poems (1878) on Gallica]\n* [http://www.florilege.free.fr/florilege/evanture/index.htm Choice of poems]\n\n{{Portal| Quebec|poetry|French literature}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Evanturel, Eudore}}\n[[Category:Wikipedia: Quebec draft]]\n[[Category:Quebec poet]]\n[[Category:19th-century Canadian writers]]\n[[Category:Birth in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Birth in September 1852]]\n[[Category:Deaths in May 1919]]\n[[Category:Deaths in Boston]]\n[[Category:Death at 66]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Eudore|\u00c9vanturel}}\n{{Infobox person\n | name             = Eudore \u00c9vanturel\n | image            = \n | caption          = \n | birth_date       = {{Birth date|1852|09|22|df=yes}}\n | birth_place      = [[Quebec (city)]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]\n | death_date       = {{Death date and age|1919|05|16|1852|09|22|df=yes}}\n | death_place      = [[Boston]], [[Massachussets]], [[United States]]\n | other_names      = \n | known_for        = \n | occupation       = [[Poet]]\n | nationality      = \n}}\n'''Eudore \u00c9vanturel''' ([[Quebec (city)|Quebec]], 22 September 1852 \u2013 [[Boston]], 16 May 1919) is a Quebec poet, [[Canada]].\n\n== Biography ==\nInterested very early in poetry, he frequented clubs of young writers.
