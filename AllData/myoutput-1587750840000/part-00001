Of mixed parentage, including [[Muscogee people|Creek]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[African American]], and English, he was considered born to his mother's people in the Creek [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system. He was reared by her in the Creek tradition. When he was a child, they migrated to Florida with other [[Red Stick]] refugees after their group's defeat in 1814 in the [[Creek Wars]]. There they became part of what was known as the Seminole people.\n\nIn 1836, Osceola led a small group of warriors in the Seminole resistance during the [[Second Seminole War]], when the United States tried to [[Indian Removal|remove]] the tribe from their lands in [[Florida Territory|Florida]] to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. He became an adviser to [[Micanopy]], the principal chief of the Seminole from 1825 to 1849.<ref name=myths>[http://tfn.net/~cdk901/osceola.htm \"Osceola, the Man and the Myths\"], retrieved January 11, 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202105713/http://tfn.net/~cdk901/osceola.htm |date=December 2, 2006 }}</ref> Osceola led the Seminole resistance to [[Indian Removal|removal]] until he was captured on October 21, 1837, by deception, under a flag of truce,<ref>Mahon, John K.

The village is a city now known as [[Tallassee, Alabama]], which Is located on the banks of the Tallapoosa River about twenty miles upstream from Fort Toulouse where the Tallapoosa and the Coosa Rivers meet to form the Alabama River. The inhabitants of the original Talisi village and of the current city of Tallassee were a mixture of all races. The Creek were among the Southeastern Native Americans who held slaves. Powell was believed to have ancestors from all of these groups.<ref name=\"Shapiro2000\">{{cite web|author1=Phyllis Shapiro|title=Myths and Dreams: Exploring the Cultural Legacies of Florida and the Caribbean|url=http://www.kislakfoundation.org/millennium-exhibit/profiles6.htm|website=kislakfoundation.org|publisher=Jay I.

Because the Creek had a [[matrilineal]] kinship system, Polly and Ann's children were all considered to be born into their mother's [[clan]]; they were reared by their mothers and their maternal male relatives as traditional Creek and gained their social status from their mother's people. Ann McQueen was also mixed-race Creek; her father, James McQueen, was Scottish. Ann was probably the sister or aunt of [[Peter McQueen]], a prominent Creek leader and warrior.

In adulthood, as part of the Seminole, Powell was given his name ''Osceola'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0252|s|i\u02d0|\u02c8|o\u028a|l|\u0259}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|o\u028a|s|e\u026a|\u02c8|o\u028a|l|\u0259}}).

After early military skirmishes and the signing of the 1823 [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]], by which the US seized the northern Seminole lands, Osceola and his family moved with the Seminole deeper into the unpopulated wilds of central and southern Florida.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 55\u201358</ref>\n\nAs an adult, Osceola took two wives, as did some other high-ranking Creek and Seminole leaders. With them, he had at least five children. One of his wives was African American, and Osceola fiercely opposed the enslavement of free people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Giddings|first=Joshua R.|title=The Exiles of Florida|year=1858|publisher=Follet, Foster and Company|location=Columbus, OH|page=97|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41316/41316-h/41316-h.htm#CHAPTER_VII}}</ref> Lt.

In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]], by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Indian Territory]]. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 87\u201389</ref> Donald L. Fixico, an American Indian historian, says he made a research trip to the National Archives to see the original Treaty of Fort Gibson (also known as the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]]), and that upon close inspection, he observed that it had \"a small triangular hole shaped like the point of a knife blade\".<ref name=\"Fixico2017\">{{cite book|author=Donald L.

In retaliation, the US Indian agent, [[Wiley Thompson]], declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]], who were forbidden by law to carry arms.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 82\u201385</ref>\n\nThompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson, who had the warrior locked up at [[Fort King]] for two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.<ref>Hatch 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nOn December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed the Indian agent. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, more than 100 troops, who were marching from [[Fort Brooke]] to Fort King. Americans called this event the [[Dade Massacre]]. These nearly simultaneous attacks catalyzed the [[Second Seminole War]] with the United States.<ref>Mishall, John and Mary Lou Mishall. 2004.

Of mixed parentage, including [[Muscogee people|Creek]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[African American]], and English, he was considered born to his mother's people in the Creek [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system. He was reared by her in the Creek tradition. When he was a child, they migrated to Florida with other [[Red Stick]] refugees after their group's defeat in 1814 in the [[Creek Wars]]. There they became part of what was known as the Seminole people.\n\nIn 1836, Osceola led a small group of warriors in the Seminole resistance during the [[Second Seminole War]], when the United States tried to [[Indian Removal|remove]] the tribe from their lands in [[Florida Territory|Florida]] to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. He became an adviser to [[Micanopy]], the principal chief of the Seminole from 1825 to 1849.<ref name=myths>[http://tfn.net/~cdk901/osceola.htm \"Osceola, the Man and the Myths\"], retrieved January 11, 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202105713/http://tfn.net/~cdk901/osceola.htm |date=December 2, 2006 }}</ref> Osceola led the Seminole resistance to [[Indian Removal|removal]] until he was captured on October 21, 1837, by deception, under a flag of truce,<ref>Mahon, John K.

The village is a city now known as [[Tallassee, Alabama]], which Is located on the banks of the Tallapoosa River about twenty miles upstream from Fort Toulouse where the Tallapoosa and the Coosa Rivers meet to form the Alabama River. The inhabitants of the original Talisi village and of the current city of Tallassee were a mixture of all races. The Creek were among the Southeastern Native Americans who held slaves.

With them, he had at least five children.

In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]], by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Indian Territory]].

In retaliation, the US Indian agent, [[Wiley Thompson]], declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]], who were forbidden by law to carry arms.<ref>Hatch 2012, pp. 82\u201385</ref>\n\nThompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson, who had the warrior locked up at [[Fort King]] for two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson.<ref>Hatch 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nOn December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed the Indian agent. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, more than 100 troops, who were marching from [[Fort Brooke]] to Fort King. Americans called this event the [[Dade Massacre]]. These nearly simultaneous attacks catalyzed the [[Second Seminole War]] with the United States.<ref>Mishall, John and Mary Lou Mishall. 2004.
