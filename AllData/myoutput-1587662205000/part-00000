The park was named in honor of former Costa Rican president [[Braulio Carrillo]], whose administration had helped foster the nation's early agricultural economy and had built the first road linking San Jos\u00e9 to the [[Caribbean]] coast.\n\n==Natural history==\nThe park contains many notable geological features, such as the [[Barva Volcano]]; and several dormant volcanoes including Cerro Chompipe, Cerro Cacho Negro, and Cerros las Tres Marias.  The Barva sector has three [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]]s \u2014 Barva, Danta, and Copey. \n\nThe park also protects areas of the [[Sarapiqu\u00ed River]] watershed, including large amounts of primary cloud and rainforest, and the flora and fauna that makes it their home.
