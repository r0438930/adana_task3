The film stars [[Chris Hemsworth]], Rudhraksh Jaiswal, [[Randeep Hooda]], [[Priyanshu Painyuli]], [[Golshifteh Farahani]], [[Pankaj Tripathi]], Suraj Rikame, and [[David Harbour]]. The plot follows a black ops mercenary who must rescue a Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in [[Bangladesh]].\n\nThe film was released on April 24, 2020, by [[Netflix]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Hemsworth's performance and the stunt work, but lamented the story and excessive violence.\n\n==Plot==\nTyler Rake ([[Chris Hemsworth]]), a black-market mercenary, is recruited by fellow mercenary Nik Khan ([[ Golshifteh Farahani]]) to rescue Ovi Mahajan, Junior (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of India's biggest drug lord Ovi Mahajan, Senior ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), from [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]. \n\nWhilst Rake is in the process of extracting Ovi from his kidnappers, Saju ([[Randeep Hooda]]), a former Special Forces soldier and Ovi's father's chief henchman, acts of his own accord in an attempt to bring the boy back, doing so in fear of his family being killed and in order to avoid paying the substantial ransom money, which neither he nor Ovi's currently incarcerated father can afford. Elsewhere, Bangladesh's biggest drug lord Amir Asif ([[Priyanshu Painyuli]]) calls for an immediate lockdown of the city. \n\nAfter escaping Saju and the corrupt police and military \u2014 both of which are controlled by Asif \u2014  Rake and Ovi encounter Farhad, a boy who wants to prove himself to Amir by killing Rake, and his gang. Rake fights off, but does not kill the boys. They are later picked up by an old friend and retired squadmate of Rake's living in Dhaka, Gaspar ([[David Harbour]]). Taking the pair to his home, he and Rake catch up before Gaspar leaves and Rake takes food upstairs to Ovi. The two talk about Rake's six-year-old son who died of [[lymphoma]]. When Gaspar returns home, he tries to convince Rake to give up Ovi and reveals to him that Asif is actually a friend who he cannot betray. He and Rake fight, and Ovi finds the two mid-fight. Gaspar starts to explain and approaches Ovi, but Ovi ends up shooting Gaspar twice and kills him. \n\nRake phones Saju and asks for his help, forcing them to team up against the police and military in order to escape the city. Rake draws attention away from Saju and Ovi as the two make their way through a bridge checkpoint. Rake makes his way back towards the bridge along with Khan's extraction team of mercenaries as Asif watches from afar. During the ensuing firefight, Saju is killed by Asif's colonel who is then in turn killed by Khan. Rake continues to cover the extraction and is severely wounded in the shootout. He instructs Ovi to run towards an awaiting helicopter and continues firing with the intent to follow. Ovi watches alongside Khan as Rake makes his way towards the helicopter, only to be shot in the side of the neck by Farhad. Rake drags himself to the side of the bridge and falls over the barrier into the river. Ovi, Khan and the extraction team escape to [[Mumbai]], [[India]].\n  \nEight months later, Asif is killed by Khan in the washroom of a restaurant. Ovi jumps into his school's swimming pool and as he surfaces sees a foreigner watching over him, possibly Tyler.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as Tyler Rake, a former [[SASR]] operator turned mercenary\n* Rudhraksh Jaiswal as Ovi Mahajan Jr., the son of Indian crime lord Ovi Mahajan Sr.\n* [[Randeep Hooda]] as Saju, a former [[Para (Special Forces)]] operator and henchman of Ovi SR.\n* [[Priyanshu Painyuli]] as Amir Asif, a Bangladeshi crime lord who kidnapped Ovi\n* [[Golshifteh Farahani]] as Nik Khan, a mercenary and partner of Rake\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Ovi Mahajan Sr., an Indian crime lord and father of Ovi\n* Suraj Rikame as Farhad, a young boy turned henchmen of Amir\n* [[David Harbour]] as Gaspar, a teammate of Tyler living in Dhaka\n* Adam Bessa as Yaz Khan\n* [[Shataf Figar]] as Colonel of B'Desh Elite group working for Amir\n* [[Neha Mahajan]] as Neysa \u2014 Wife of Saju\n* [[Sam Hargrave]] as Gaetan\n\n==Production==\nOn August 31, 2018, it was announced that [[Sam Hargrave]] would direct ''Dhaka'' from a screenplay by [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]].<ref name=\"details\">{{Cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/chris-hemsworth-dhaka-agbo-india-extraction-drama-sam-hargrave-joe-russo-anthony-russo-1202454550/ |title=Busy AGBO Sets India Kidnap Drama 'Dhaka' At Netflix: Chris Hemsworth Stars & Sam Hargrave Helms Joe Russo Script |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Mike, Jr. |last=Fleming |date=August 30, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> In addition, [[Chris Hemsworth]] was set to star in the film.<ref name=\"details\"/> In November 2018, the rest of the cast was set.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/david-harbour-joins-chris-hemsworth-action-movie-dhaka-1162067|title=David Harbour Joins Chris Hemsworth in Russo Brothers Action Movie 'Dhaka' (Exclusive) |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=November 16, 2018 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Filming\"/>\n\nProduction began in [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Mumbai]] in November 2018.<ref name=\"Filming\">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/netflix-chris-hemsworth-dhaka-india-golshifteh-farahani-russo-brothers-1202510896/|title=Russo Brothers Wrap Indian Leg of Netflix Pic 'Dhaka' With Chris Hemsworth, David Harbour, Golshifteh Farahani |first1=Andreas |last1=Wiseman |work=Deadline Hollywood |date=November 29, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Filming next took place in [[Ban Pong]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Thailand]] and plateshots in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].
