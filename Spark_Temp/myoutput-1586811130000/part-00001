Major constraints control its practice despite it being legal.<ref name=Ling-Jomo/> Police unofficially tolerate and monitor a limited number of brothels, where the prostitutes are regularly screened for health check-ups; however prostitution outside these brothels also exists such as via social escort agencies that usually adopt an internet website or [[Facebook]] presence. Prostitution outside the informally designated red-light areas operates via three main channels: internet advertising, street solicitation, and [[karaoke box]] and [[massage parlor]] work. The internet-advertised sex workers are based in anonymous hotels, and the profile of each sex worker is available from the internet advertisement. Interested [[Client (prostitution)|clients]] contact the sex worker's agent through [[SMS]], who arranges the timing and gives the hotel address to the client. Sex workers operating via such illegal pimps come primarily from [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Philippines]] to Singapore for a short tourist visit, and therefore are not screened for health check-ups. There are also local Singaporean masseurs, therapists, [[call girl]]s or social escorts in the industry working as sex workers on the pretext of being students at a local educational institution such as a [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]], models, working office professionals or ex-[[air stewardess]]es. Some of these say that they are certified therapists. Apart from the usual bilingual [[Chinese Singaporeans|Singaporean Chinese]] that speak [[English language|English]] as well as a mother tongue such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], other ethnic races on the island such as [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] women also work as social escorts often using an [[English name]], alongside Eurasians and Russians. Vietnamese prostitutes in Singapore charge high prices for their services.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=9 August 2014 |title=More bang for your buck: How new technology is shaking up the oldest business |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21611074-how-new-technology-shaking-up-oldest-business-more-bang-your-buck |newspaper=The Economist |location= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThere are grey areas such as social escorts which do not infringe on the women's charter in Singapore's law.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nApart from these regulated brothels, commercial sex workers can be found in many \"massage\" or \"spa\" establishments.

Major constraints control its practice despite it being legal.<ref name=Ling-Jomo/> Police unofficially tolerate and monitor a limited number of brothels, where the prostitutes are regularly screened for health check-ups; however prostitution outside these brothels also exists such as via social escort agencies that usually adopt an internet website or [[Facebook]] presence. Prostitution outside the informally designated red-light areas operates via three main channels: internet advertising, street solicitation, and [[karaoke box]] and [[massage parlor]] work. The internet-advertised sex workers are based in anonymous hotels, and the profile of each sex worker is available from the internet advertisement. Interested [[Client (prostitution)|clients]] contact the sex worker's agent through [[SMS]], who arranges the timing and gives the hotel address to the client. Sex workers operating via such illegal pimps come primarily from [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Philippines]] to Singapore for a short tourist visit, and therefore are not screened for health check-ups. There are also local Singaporean masseurs, therapists, [[call girl]]s or social escorts in the industry working as sex workers on the pretext of being students at a local educational institution such as a [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]], models, working office professionals or ex-[[air stewardess]]es. Some of these say that they are certified therapists. Apart from the usual bilingual [[Chinese Singaporeans|Singaporean Chinese]] that speak [[English language|English]] as well as a mother tongue such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], other ethnic races on the island such as [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] women also work as social escorts often using an [[English name]], alongside Eurasians and Russians.
