Construction on the segment of the line that includes Union Street started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in September 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926&ndash;1927,<ref name=\"SU-Opens-1927\"/> and again in 1970.<ref name=\":1\"/> The Fourth Avenue portion was built as part of the Culver Line of the city-operated [[Independent Subway System]], and was constructed as an elevated station so the line could pass over the [[Gowanus Canal]] to the west. This station opened on October 7, 1933. The two stations were consolidated into a single station complex on May 28, 1959.\n\n__TOC__\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== History ==\n===Fourth Avenue Line===\n\n==== Construction and opening ====\nThe Ninth Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, and was the first part of this station complex to open.
