She was nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] in May 2010, and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in August of the same year. She is the fourth woman to serve as a Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nKagan was born and raised in [[New York City]]. After graduating from [[Princeton University]], the [[Worcester College, Oxford|University of Oxford]], and [[Harvard Law School]], she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]]. She began her career as a professor at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], leaving to serve as Associate [[White House Counsel]], and later as policy adviser under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. After a nomination to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]], which expired without action, she became a professor at [[Harvard Law School]] and was later named its first female [[Dean (education)|dean]].\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female [[Solicitor General of the United States]]. President Obama [[Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] her to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice [[John Paul Stevens]]. The [[United States Senate]] confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63 to 37. She is considered part of the Court's liberal wing but tends to be one of the more moderate justices of that group. She wrote the [[majority opinion]] in ''[[Cooper v.
