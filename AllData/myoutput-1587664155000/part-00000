In the mid-7th century, Great Bulgaria expanded west to include [[Avar Khaganate|Avar territory]] and was centered in [[Poltava]].

Agathon wrote about the \"nation of Onogur Bul\u011fars\",{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople|Nikephoros I]] stated that Kubrat was lord of the ''Onogundurs'', [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] referred to them as ''Onogundur Bulgars'' and  [[Constantine VII]] remarked that the Bulgars formerly called themselves ''Onogundurs''. Variations of the name include ''Onoguri, Onoghuri, Onghur, Ongur, Onghuri, Onguri, Onogundur, Unogundur'' and ''Unokundur''. There are several theories about the origin of the name Onogur. In some Turkic languages ''on'' means \"10\" and ''\u011fur'' \"arrow\"; and \"ten arrows\" a federation of ten tribes, i.e. the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]].  Within the Turkic languages, \"z\" sounds in the easternmost languages tend to have become \"r\" in the westernmost Turkic languages; therefore, the ethnonym [[Turkic tribal confederations|Oghuz]] may be the source of Oghur; that is, ''on O\u011fur'' would mean \"ten clans of Oghuz\".\n\n==Establishment==\nBetween 630 and 635, [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kubrat]] managed to unite the [[Onogurs|Onogur]] [[Bulgars]] with the tribes of [[Kutrigurs]] and [[Utigurs]] under a single rule, creating a powerful confederation which was referred to by the [[medieval]] authors in [[Western Europe]] as Old Great Bulgaria,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople]], ''Historia syntomos, breviarium''</ref> or ''Patria Onoguria''.

There they established [[Volga Bulgaria]], at the confluence of the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Kama River|Kama]]. As the Volga or Silver [[Bulgars]] (''Bessermens''), they converted voluntarily to [[Islam]] in the 9th century. They managed to preserve their national identity well into the 13th century, by repelling the first [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks in 1223. However, they were eventually subdued, their capital [[Bolghar]] city became one of major cities of the [[Golden Horde]] of the Mongols and the Bulgars mixed with the [[Tatars]]. The citizens of the modern [[Russian Federation|Russian]] republics of [[Tatarstan]] and [[Chuvashia Republic|Chuvashia]] are considered to be descendants of those Bulgars.\n\n===Bulgars in Vojvodina and Macedonia===\n[[Kuber]] ruled in [[Sirmium]] over a mixed group of peoples \u2013 [[Bulgars]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] subjects, [[Early Slavs|Slavs]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[tribes]] \u2013 as a vassal of the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar]] [[Khagan]]. After a revolt he led his people to [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. There he had settled in the region of Keremisia and made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city of [[Thessaloniki]]. After this, he disappears from history and his people were later consolidated into the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Krum]].\n\n===Bulgars in Italy===\nOther [[Bulgars]], circa 662, led by their \"Duke Alzeco\" ([[Alcek]]) sought refuge from the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] with the [[Lombards]] and requested land from the [[Grimoald, King of the Lombards|Lombard King Grimoald I]] in exchange for military service \"for an uncertain reason\", initially staying near [[Ravenna]] and later moving further south. Grimoald sent Alcek and his followers to his son [[Romuald I of Benevento|Romuald]] in [[Benevento]] and they were then granted by Romuald land northeast of [[Naples]] in the \"spacious but up till that time deserted\" towns of [[Sepino]], Bovianum ([[Boiano]]), and [[Isernia]], in the present-day region of [[Molise]] in the [[Apennines]].

During the late 7th century, however, an [[Avar Khaganate#Middle (670-720) and Late (720-804) Avar periods|Avar-Slavic alliance]] in the west, and [[Khazars]] in the east, defeated the Bulgars, and Great Bulgaria disintegrated. Successor states included [[Volga Bulgaria]] and the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].\n\n==Origins==\n{{main|Origin of the Bulgars}}\n\nThe etymology of the ethnonym ''[[wikt:Bulgar|Bulgar]]'' is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD.<ref name=\"Gurov\">{{cite web |first=Dilian|last=Gurov |date=March 2007 |title=The Origins of the Bulgars |url=https://www.nada.kth.se/~dilian/bulgars.pdf |pages=3}}</ref>{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=103\u2013104}}  It is generally believed to derive from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] verb ''bul\u011fha'' (to \"stir\", \"mix\", \"disturb\", \"confuse\"),{{sfn|Bowersock, Brown, Grabar|1999|p=354}} possibly suggesting that other [[Turkic peoples]] regarded the [[Bulgars]] as a \"mixed\"  people,{{sfn|Maenchen-Helfen|1973|p=384}} and/or \"rebellious\".{{sfn|Chen|2012|p=97}}<ref>{{cite book |author=Leif Inge Ree Petersen |date=2013 |title=Siege Warfare and Military Organization in the Successor States (400-800 AD): Byzantium, the West and Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRGaAAAAQBAJ |publisher=Brill |pages=369 |isbn=9789004254466}}</ref>{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=104}}{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=143}}{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=104}}{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=143}}\n\nLater [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] scholars implied that the Bulgars had previously been known as the [[Onogurs]] (''Ono\u011fur''). Agathon wrote about the \"nation of Onogur Bul\u011fars\",{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople|Nikephoros I]] stated that Kubrat was lord of the ''Onogundurs'', [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] referred to them as ''Onogundur Bulgars'' and  [[Constantine VII]] remarked that the Bulgars formerly called themselves ''Onogundurs''. Variations of the name include ''Onoguri, Onoghuri, Onghur, Ongur, Onghuri, Onguri, Onogundur, Unogundur'' and ''Unokundur''. There are several theories about the origin of the name Onogur. In some Turkic languages ''on'' means \"10\" and ''\u011fur'' \"arrow\"; and \"ten arrows\" a federation of ten tribes, i.e. the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]].  Within the Turkic languages, \"z\" sounds in the easternmost languages tend to have become \"r\" in the westernmost Turkic languages; therefore, the ethnonym [[Turkic tribal confederations|Oghuz]] may be the source of Oghur; that is, ''on O\u011fur'' would mean \"ten clans of Oghuz\".\n\n==Establishment==\nBetween 630 and 635, [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kubrat]] managed to unite the [[Onogurs|Onogur]] [[Bulgars]] with the tribes of [[Kutrigurs]] and [[Utigurs]] under a single rule, creating a powerful confederation which was referred to by the [[medieval]] authors in [[Western Europe]] as Old Great Bulgaria,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople]], ''Historia syntomos, breviarium''</ref> or ''Patria Onoguria''.

Ultimately, however although there is no evidence that the [[Utigurs]] were independent of the Onogurs until after Kubrat's empire disintegrated, it is believed he seceded from the Onogurs when they became entangled in dynastic wars. After Kubrat's burial in [[Pereshchepina Treasure|Mala Pereshchepina]], the [[Khazars]], who had triumphed in the collapse of Onoguria, subjugated Kubrat's eldest son and heir [[Batbayan]], forcing his other sons to flee north up the [[Volga]] (2nd son Kotrag) and west into the [[Balkans]] (4th son Kuber and 3rd son [[Asparukh]]) and [[Italy]] (5th son Alcek, Alzek) <ref>[http://philology-and-culture.kpfu.ru/?q=system/files/39_0.pdf Mingazov S.

There they established [[Volga Bulgaria]], at the confluence of the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Kama River|Kama]]. As the Volga or Silver [[Bulgars]] (''Bessermens''), they converted voluntarily to [[Islam]] in the 9th century. They managed to preserve their national identity well into the 13th century, by repelling the first [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks in 1223. However, they were eventually subdued, their capital [[Bolghar]] city became one of major cities of the [[Golden Horde]] of the Mongols and the Bulgars mixed with the [[Tatars]]. The citizens of the modern [[Russian Federation|Russian]] republics of [[Tatarstan]] and [[Chuvashia Republic|Chuvashia]] are considered to be descendants of those Bulgars.\n\n===Bulgars in Vojvodina and Macedonia===\n[[Kuber]] ruled in [[Sirmium]] over a mixed group of peoples \u2013 [[Bulgars]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] subjects, [[Early Slavs|Slavs]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[tribes]] \u2013 as a vassal of the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar]] [[Khagan]]. After a revolt he led his people to [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. There he had settled in the region of Keremisia and made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city of [[Thessaloniki]]. After this, he disappears from history and his people were later consolidated into the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Krum]].\n\n===Bulgars in Italy===\nOther [[Bulgars]], circa 662, led by their \"Duke Alzeco\" ([[Alcek]]) sought refuge from the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] with the [[Lombards]] and requested land from the [[Grimoald, King of the Lombards|Lombard King Grimoald I]] in exchange for military service \"for an uncertain reason\", initially staying near [[Ravenna]] and later moving further south. Grimoald sent Alcek and his followers to his son [[Romuald I of Benevento|Romuald]] in [[Benevento]] and they were then granted by Romuald land northeast of [[Naples]] in the \"spacious but up till that time deserted\" towns of [[Sepino]], Bovianum ([[Boiano]]), and [[Isernia]], in the present-day region of [[Molise]] in the [[Apennines]].
