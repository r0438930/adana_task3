Like most organizations at the time, it was a segregated institution. It wasn't until 1962 that [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregation]] took full effect; black and white students could share full schedules together. In 1963, the ballsack first new building was constructed, and Peter Masiko would become president for the next 18 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linccweb.org/webscripts/lwauth.aspx?calling_system=ezproxy&institute=flcc1600&url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&t=&sort=YMD_date:A&fld-base-0=alltext&maxresults=20&val-base-0=%20%22Dade%20County%20Junior%20College%22&docref=news/0EB360A06EE6EE4D|title=LINCCWeb Catalog Search|website=www.linccweb.org|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> As the years progressed, more campuses began opening across the county: the Kendall Campus and Wolfson Campus.\n\nInitially, the college had an open admissions policy, meaning anyone who could afford to pay was allowed to study at the campus. Due to this, the college aimed to improve its academic stance among alumni. To encourage this movement, a Medical Center was built for students in [[Allied health professions|Allied Health]] and Nursing ([[Registered nurse|RN]]) programs. As the number of Cuban exiles and refugees began to rise in 1980, and [[Outreach|outreach center]] was built in the city of [[Hialeah]]. This allowed refugees and immigrants educational opportunities that they wouldn't be able to achieve otherwise. Another outreach center, the InterAmerican center, was built to accommodate [[bilingual education]]. The Homestead Campus was built in 1990 in [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] to relieve the concerns of students having to drive to the Kendall Campus In Miami. In the mid-1990s, the college began to rely heavily on the Miami Dade College Foundation as the [[Florida Legislature|Florida legislature]] reduced the state's education budget. The college also had to figure out new ways of recruiting students and it began its \"Successful Alumni\" campaign in the late 1990s, marketing the success of the college's alumni to local prospective students.\n\nBeginning in 2001, the college implemented a strategic plan to revamp the college and its recruiting goals. In 2002, the college disbanded its [[Honors colleges and programs|Honors Program]] and created The Honors College for talented high school graduates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdc.edu/about/history.aspx|title=History of MDC {{!}} Miami Dade College|website=www.mdc.edu|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> The [[Honors colleges and programs|Honors College]] is a representation of Miami Dade College's most [[Academically gifted|academically-gifted]] students in different fields and was originally based on the three larger campuses (Wolfson, Kendall, and North).In 2006, Miami Dade College surpassed 1.5 million students enrolled throughout its history. In 2007, The Honors College expanded into the InterAmerican Campus with The Honors College Dual Language Honors Program to tailor to the needs of the growing Spanish-speaking population in the [[United States]] as well as abroad. The Dual Language Honors Program opened its doors to bilingual students who wish to continue their careers with professional fluency in the English and Spanish languages. In 2009, The MDC Honors College Dual Language Program earned the merit of Innovation of the Year in the Learning and Teaching Department from the League for Innovation. In 2018, Miami Dade was awarded and recognized for its path to economic and social mobility by the Aspen Institute. The award received was the $1 million Aspen Prize.\n\nOn February 1, 2019, [[Eduardo J.

Due to this, the college aimed to improve its academic stance among alumni. To encourage this movement, a Medical Center was built for students in [[Allied health professions|Allied Health]] and Nursing ([[Registered nurse|RN]]) programs. As the number of Cuban exiles and refugees began to rise in 1980, and [[Outreach|outreach center]] was built in the city of [[Hialeah]]. This allowed refugees and immigrants educational opportunities that they wouldn't be able to achieve otherwise. Another outreach center, the InterAmerican center, was built to accommodate [[bilingual education]]. The Homestead Campus was built in 1990 in [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] to relieve the concerns of students having to drive to the Kendall Campus In Miami. In the mid-1990s, the college began to rely heavily on the Miami Dade College Foundation as the [[Florida Legislature|Florida legislature]] reduced the state's education budget. The college also had to figure out new ways of recruiting students and it began its \"Successful Alumni\" campaign in the late 1990s, marketing the success of the college's alumni to local prospective students.\n\nBeginning in 2001, the college implemented a strategic plan to revamp the college and its recruiting goals. In 2002, the college disbanded its [[Honors colleges and programs|Honors Program]] and created The Honors College for talented high school graduates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdc.edu/about/history.aspx|title=History of MDC {{!}} Miami Dade College|website=www.mdc.edu|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> The [[Honors colleges and programs|Honors College]] is a representation of Miami Dade College's most [[Academically gifted|academically-gifted]] students in different fields and was originally based on the three larger campuses (Wolfson, Kendall, and North).In 2006, Miami Dade College surpassed 1.5 million students enrolled throughout its history. In 2007, The Honors College expanded into the InterAmerican Campus with The Honors College Dual Language Honors Program to tailor to the needs of the growing Spanish-speaking population in the [[United States]] as well as abroad. The Dual Language Honors Program opened its doors to bilingual students who wish to continue their careers with professional fluency in the English and Spanish languages. In 2009, The MDC Honors College Dual Language Program earned the merit of Innovation of the Year in the Learning and Teaching Department from the League for Innovation. In 2018, Miami Dade was awarded and recognized for its path to economic and social mobility by the Aspen Institute. The award received was the $1 million Aspen Prize.\n\nOn February 1, 2019, [[Eduardo J.
