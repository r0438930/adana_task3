Her performance earned her the London critics' [[Plays & Players]] Best Actress award.\n\nBeginning in November 1975, Mirren played in West End repertory with the Lyric Theatre Company as Nina in ''[[The Seagull]]'' and Ella in [[Ben Travers]]'s new farce ''The Bed Before Yesterday'' (\"Mirren is stirringly voluptuous as the [[Jean Harlow|Harlowesque]] good-time girl\": [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], ''The Guardian'', 10 December 1975).

In ''[[Elegy for a Lady]]'' she played the svelte proprietress of a classy boutique, while as the blonde hooker in ''[[Some Kind of Love Story]]'' she was \"clad in a Freudian slip and shifting easily from waif-like vulnerability to sexual aggression, giving the role a breathy Monroesque quality\" (Michael Billington, ''The Guardian'').\n\nOn 15 February 2013, at the West End's [[Gielgud Theatre]] she began a turn as [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in the World Premiere of [[Peter Morgan]]'s ''[[The Audience (2013 play)|The Audience]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitthetheatre.co.uk/showEvent.php?cat=&&id=3613 |title=The Audience |website=Hit The Theatre.co.uk |access-date=30 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116232730/http://www.hitthetheatre.co.uk/showEvent.php?cat=&&id=3613 |archive-date=16 January 2013}}</ref> The show was directed by [[Stephen Daldry]].
