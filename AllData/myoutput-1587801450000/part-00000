Under the ownership of the Soraine family the village grew in wealth, from an obscure little fishing village, Gopalpur became a prominent trading port. The family built the port, the lighthouse and the Albert Hotel and established both a local fishing industry and a trade route with Burma.\n\nThey also established the bylaw allowing any villagers who could build a house, with a perimeter and light a fire in the fireplace overnight, could then keep the land and house (on the backwaters) as their own.\n\nDuring the British rule family squabbles and disputes resulted in much being transferred to British missionaries. The Albert Hotel now locked in ownership battles and lying derelict is the last remnant of those squabbles.\n\nDuring the days of [[British East India Company]] The [[East India Company]] built large [[warehouse]]s and [[godown]]s because the trade with [[Burma]] had picked up and it had become a trading point for rice from [[Rangoon]].\n\nVictor Soraine returned to India from England and built BetVic house where he retired, surrounded by memories of childhood and his family legacy. His final wish was granted when he was buried in his ancestral lands just a few years ago.\n\nGopalpur has reverted to being a quiet, relaxed place but with one major difference \u2014 it is one of India's most sought after beaches, with a distinct charm of its own.\n\n==Beach==\n[[File:Gopalpur Sea Beach.jpg|750px|center|thumb|Panorama view of Gopalpur Sea Beach]]\nBarely 16&nbsp;km away from [[Brahmapur, Odisha|Brahmapur]], the commercial hub of southern [[Odisha]] and close to the border of [[Andhra Pradesh]], is the tiny town of Gopalpur on the [[Bay of Bengal]].
