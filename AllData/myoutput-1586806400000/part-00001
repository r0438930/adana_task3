He viewed the natural state of humanity as that which had existed prior to the [[fall of man]], in which slavery was non-existent; on those grounds, many commentators see him as rejecting Aristotle's claim that some people were naturally slaves, although it is a matter of controversy as to whether he fully rejected Aristotle's views on the matter.<ref name=\"KretzmannStump1993\">{{cite book|author1=Norman Kretzmann|author2=Eleonore Stump|title=The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi4rA6LQN5sC&pg=PA226|date=28 May 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43769-1|pages=222\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n==John Locke==\n[[John Locke]] discusses slavery in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Government]]''.

He sees this contradiction as ultimately unsolvable:\n<blockquote>Locke never addressed, much less resolved, this contradiction. On Afro-American slavery, silence seems to have been his principal bequest to posterity. Locke's silence is all the more difficult to fathom inasmuch as in the ''Two Treatises'' he developed a general theory and justification of slavery for captives taken in a just war ... I hope to show that this theory is woefully inadequate as an account of Afro-American slavery and, further, that ''Locke knew this'' ... Locke's silence about the Afro-American slave practices that he helped forward remains profoundly unsettling and poses one of the greatest problems for understanding Locke as a theorist and political actor<ref name=\"Farr1986\" /></blockquote>\nWhile Locke criticised slavery as \"so vile and miserable an estate of man\",<ref>{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C.

Proslavery arguments, on the other hand, positively promoted slavery and the slave trade\". Dumas notes that proslavery (as opposed to anti-abolitionist) positions largely disappeared from the British Parliament after the 1807 abolition of the slave trade.<ref name=\"Dumas2016\">{{cite book|author=Paula E.

For example, [[Thomas Roderick Dew]], in an essay published in September 1832, quoted approvingly British Foreign Secretary (and later Prime Minister) [[George Canning]]'s speech to the House of Commons of 16 March 1824 opposing abolition, in which he compared emancipated slaves to Shelley's Frankenstein.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rugemer|first=Edward B.|date=2004-05-01|title=The Southern Response to British Abolitionism: The Maturation of Proslavery Apologetics|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/27648398?origin=crossref|journal=The Journal of Southern History|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=221|doi=10.2307/27648398}}</ref>\n\n==In the United States==\n{{also|Treatment of slaves in the United States}}\nIn the United States, pro-slavery sentiment arose in the [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] period as a reaction to the growing [[abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]] movement in the United States in the late 18th century and early 19th century.

Tise argues against what he believes is the mistaken position that proslavery thought was unique to the antebellum American South:\n<blockquote>Among the numerous myths perpetuated by traditional interpretations of proslavery history, none has stood on shakier ground or proved more misleading than the notion that, for all practical purposes, proslavery was a phenomenon that appeared only in the antebellum South. From the age of the abolitionist through recent historiography the impression has remained that the Old South alone deserved the dubious distinction of fostering proslavery thought and building a culture largely defined by its buttressing of slavery.<ref name=\"Tise1990\">{{cite book|author=Larry E.

He argues that the debate over slavery is more accurately seen, not as something exclusively American, but as a debate occurring throughout the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Tise1990\"/>\n\n===Abolitionism in the United States===\n{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}\nUntil the middle of the 18th century, slavery was practiced with little challenge anywhere in the world.  For centuries philosophers as varied as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[John Locke]] accepted slavery as part of a proper social system. However, across Europe through the last part of the 18th century there were intellectual antislavery arguments based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, as well as moral arguments (notably among [[Quakers]], in Great Britain and the United States) which questioned the legitimacy of slavery. Only in the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]] era did slavery first become a significant social issue in North America.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 63-64</ref> In the North, beginning during the Revolution and continuing through the first decade of the next century, state by state emancipation was achieved by legislation or lawsuit<ref>African Americans and the End of slavery in Massachusetts http://www.masshist.org/endofslavery/index.php?id=54,</ref> although in the larger slaveholding states such as New York and Pennsylvania emancipation was gradual. By 1810, 75% of Northern slaves had been freed and virtually all were freed within the next generation.<ref>Kolchin (2003) p. 78</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the antislavery contention that slavery was both economically inefficient and socially detrimental{{how|date=August 2019}} to the country as a whole was more prevalent than philosophical and moral arguments against slavery.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 65-68</ref> In Virginia, as the economy shifted away from tobacco towards less labor-intensive wheat crops, more slaves were freed between 1783 and 1812 than any time until 1865.  There was the potential, in many Southern minds, for a relatively short transition away from slavery.  However this perspective rapidly changed as the worldwide demand for sugar and cotton from America increased and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] opened up vast new territories ideally suited for a plantation economy.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 218-220</ref>\n\nOnly in the early 19th century did abolitionist movements gather momentum, and many countries abolished slavery in the first half of the 19th century. The increasing rarity of slavery, combined with an increase in the number of slaves caused by a boom in the cotton trade, drew attention and criticism to the [[Southern United States|Southern states']] continuation of slavery. Faced with this growing 'antislavery' movement, slaveholders and their sympathizers began to articulate an explicit defense of slavery.\n\n===Political proslavery===\n[[Image:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|left|189px|James Henry Hammond]]\nThe famous ''Mudsill Speech (1858)'' of [[James Henry Hammond]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s [[s:Slavery a Positive Good|Speech to the U.S. Senate (1837)]]  articulated the pro-slavery political argument during the period at which the ideology was at its most mature (late 1830s \u2013 early 1860s). These pro-slavery theorists championed a class-sensitive view of American antebellum society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=magining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref> They felt that the bane of many past societies was the existence of the class of the landless poor. Southern pro-slavery theorists felt that this class of landless poor was inherently transient and easily manipulated, and as such often destabilized society as a whole. Thus, the greatest threat to democracy was seen as coming from class warfare that destabilized a nation's economy, society, government, and threatened the peaceful and harmonious implementation of laws.\n\nThis theory supposes that there must be, and supposedly always has been, a lower class for the upper classes to rest upon: the metaphor of a [[mudsill theory]] being that the lowest threshold (mudsill) supports the foundation for a building. This theory was used by its composer, Senator and Governor James Henry Hammond, a wealthy Southern plantation owner, to justify what he saw as the willingness of the non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the higher classes to move civilization forward. With this in mind, any efforts for class or racial equality that ran counter to the theory would inevitably run counter to [[civilization]] itself.\n\nSouthern pro-slavery theorists asserted that slavery eliminated this problem by elevating all free people to the status of \"citizen\", and removing the landless poor (the \"mudsill\") from the political process entirely by means of enslavement. Thus, those who would most threaten economic stability and political harmony were not allowed to undermine a democratic society, because they were not allowed to participate in it. So, in the mindset of pro-slavery men, slavery was for protecting the common good of slaves, masters, and society as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=Imagining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Book|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref>\n\nThese and other arguments fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes, and non-whites to gain higher [[standards of living]]. The economic self-interest of slaveholders certainly played a role, as slaves represented a massive amount of wealth \u2013 at the time of the Civil War some historians estimate the over 20% of private wealth in the US was slaves.<ref>Piketty, Thomas. \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century.\" Harvard University Press, 2014 067443000X, 9780674430006</ref>  They saw the abolition of slavery as a threat to their powerful Southern economy: an economy that revolved almost entirely around the plantation system and was supported by the use of black slaves.\n\n===Proslavery Christians===\n{{Further|The Bible and slavery|Christian views on slavery|Curse of Ham|Curse and mark of Cain}}\nPassages in the [[Bible]] which justify and regulate the institution of slavery have been used as a justification for the keeping of slaves throughout history, and they have also been used as a source of guidance on how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, many Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition. [[George Whitefield]], who is famed for his sparking of the ''Great Awakening'' of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the [[Province of Georgia]], for the legalisation of slavery,<ref name=Cashin>Edward J.

He bought enslaved Africans and put them to work on his plantation as well as at the [[Bethesda Orphanage]] which he established. [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], who played a major role in financing and guiding early Methodism, inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage.<ref name=Cashin/>\n\nIn both Europe and the United States many Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible.\n\n{{quote|[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God ... it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] ... it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts.|[[Jefferson Davis]], President, [[Confederate States of America]]<ref>[Religious Tolerance. http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm.

Locke's silence is all the more difficult to fathom inasmuch as in the ''Two Treatises'' he developed a general theory and justification of slavery for captives taken in a just war ... I hope to show that this theory is woefully inadequate as an account of Afro-American slavery and, further, that ''Locke knew this'' ...

Proslavery arguments, on the other hand, positively promoted slavery and the slave trade\".

Tise argues against what he believes is the mistaken position that proslavery thought was unique to the antebellum American South:\n<blockquote>Among the numerous myths perpetuated by traditional interpretations of proslavery history, none has stood on shakier ground or proved more misleading than the notion that, for all practical purposes, proslavery was a phenomenon that appeared only in the antebellum South. From the age of the abolitionist through recent historiography the impression has remained that the Old South alone deserved the dubious distinction of fostering proslavery thought and building a culture largely defined by its buttressing of slavery.<ref name=\"Tise1990\">{{cite book|author=Larry E.

He argues that the debate over slavery is more accurately seen, not as something exclusively American, but as a debate occurring throughout the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Tise1990\"/>\n\n===Abolitionism in the United States===\n{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}\nUntil the middle of the 18th century, slavery was practiced with little challenge anywhere in the world.  For centuries philosophers as varied as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[John Locke]] accepted slavery as part of a proper social system. However, across Europe through the last part of the 18th century there were intellectual antislavery arguments based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, as well as moral arguments (notably among [[Quakers]], in Great Britain and the United States) which questioned the legitimacy of slavery. Only in the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]] era did slavery first become a significant social issue in North America.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 63-64</ref> In the North, beginning during the Revolution and continuing through the first decade of the next century, state by state emancipation was achieved by legislation or lawsuit<ref>African Americans and the End of slavery in Massachusetts http://www.masshist.org/endofslavery/index.php?id=54,</ref> although in the larger slaveholding states such as New York and Pennsylvania emancipation was gradual. By 1810, 75% of Northern slaves had been freed and virtually all were freed within the next generation.<ref>Kolchin (2003) p. 78</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the antislavery contention that slavery was both economically inefficient and socially detrimental{{how|date=August 2019}} to the country as a whole was more prevalent than philosophical and moral arguments against slavery.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 65-68</ref> In Virginia, as the economy shifted away from tobacco towards less labor-intensive wheat crops, more slaves were freed between 1783 and 1812 than any time until 1865.  There was the potential, in many Southern minds, for a relatively short transition away from slavery.  However this perspective rapidly changed as the worldwide demand for sugar and cotton from America increased and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] opened up vast new territories ideally suited for a plantation economy.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 218-220</ref>\n\nOnly in the early 19th century did abolitionist movements gather momentum, and many countries abolished slavery in the first half of the 19th century. The increasing rarity of slavery, combined with an increase in the number of slaves caused by a boom in the cotton trade, drew attention and criticism to the [[Southern United States|Southern states']] continuation of slavery. Faced with this growing 'antislavery' movement, slaveholders and their sympathizers began to articulate an explicit defense of slavery.\n\n===Political proslavery===\n[[Image:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|left|189px|James Henry Hammond]]\nThe famous ''Mudsill Speech (1858)'' of [[James Henry Hammond]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s [[s:Slavery a Positive Good|Speech to the U.S. Senate (1837)]]  articulated the pro-slavery political argument during the period at which the ideology was at its most mature (late 1830s \u2013 early 1860s). These pro-slavery theorists championed a class-sensitive view of American antebellum society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=magining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref> They felt that the bane of many past societies was the existence of the class of the landless poor. Southern pro-slavery theorists felt that this class of landless poor was inherently transient and easily manipulated, and as such often destabilized society as a whole. Thus, the greatest threat to democracy was seen as coming from class warfare that destabilized a nation's economy, society, government, and threatened the peaceful and harmonious implementation of laws.\n\nThis theory supposes that there must be, and supposedly always has been, a lower class for the upper classes to rest upon: the metaphor of a [[mudsill theory]] being that the lowest threshold (mudsill) supports the foundation for a building. This theory was used by its composer, Senator and Governor James Henry Hammond, a wealthy Southern plantation owner, to justify what he saw as the willingness of the non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the higher classes to move civilization forward. With this in mind, any efforts for class or racial equality that ran counter to the theory would inevitably run counter to [[civilization]] itself.\n\nSouthern pro-slavery theorists asserted that slavery eliminated this problem by elevating all free people to the status of \"citizen\", and removing the landless poor (the \"mudsill\") from the political process entirely by means of enslavement. Thus, those who would most threaten economic stability and political harmony were not allowed to undermine a democratic society, because they were not allowed to participate in it. So, in the mindset of pro-slavery men, slavery was for protecting the common good of slaves, masters, and society as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=Imagining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Book|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref>\n\nThese and other arguments fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes, and non-whites to gain higher [[standards of living]]. The economic self-interest of slaveholders certainly played a role, as slaves represented a massive amount of wealth \u2013 at the time of the Civil War some historians estimate the over 20% of private wealth in the US was slaves.<ref>Piketty, Thomas. \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century.\" Harvard University Press, 2014 067443000X, 9780674430006</ref>  They saw the abolition of slavery as a threat to their powerful Southern economy: an economy that revolved almost entirely around the plantation system and was supported by the use of black slaves.\n\n===Proslavery Christians===\n{{Further|The Bible and slavery|Christian views on slavery|Curse of Ham|Curse and mark of Cain}}\nPassages in the [[Bible]] which justify and regulate the institution of slavery have been used as a justification for the keeping of slaves throughout history, and they have also been used as a source of guidance on how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, many Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition. [[George Whitefield]], who is famed for his sparking of the ''Great Awakening'' of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the [[Province of Georgia]], for the legalisation of slavery,<ref name=Cashin>Edward J.

He bought enslaved Africans and put them to work on his plantation as well as at the [[Bethesda Orphanage]] which he established. [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], who played a major role in financing and guiding early Methodism, inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage.<ref name=Cashin/>\n\nIn both Europe and the United States many Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible.\n\n{{quote|[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God ... it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] ... it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts.|[[Jefferson Davis]], President, [[Confederate States of America]]<ref>[Religious Tolerance. http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm.
