The earliest written references to Whitwell are from the Anglo-Saxon charters. However, many of its historical sites predate this period. Within the parish are several [[Iron Age]] burial mounds, an Iron Age fort and settlement, the remains of a Roman villa, medieval field systems, and both a Norman and Saxon church, the world heritage site of [[Creswell Crags]] was until recently within the parish. [[Whitwell Old Hall]] is a medieval manor house.\n\nWhitwell won the 'Best Kept Village in Derbyshire' Award in 1988.\n\nWhitwell is a thriving village with strong community spirit. The village has many active clubs and societies, including Whitwell Scout and Guide Group, Local History Group, Whitwell Players, Whitwell Brass Band and junior band, C of E, Methodist and Poplar churches, Natural History Group, green bowls club, cricket club, and football club.\n\nAlthough being quite a small village, Whitwell has six public houses.  It previously had as many as 11 and held the record for most number of licensed premises per capita. The current pubs are Holmefield Arms, The Jack Ups (Whitwell Working Men's Club), New Middle Club, The Boot And Shoe, The Half Moon and The Royal Oak. The biggest employer just outside the village is La Farge Works (formerly Steetley Company), which run a quarry which supplies limestone and other products all around the world.\n\n[[Image:Whitwell, Derbyshire View.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View over Whitwell]]\n\n==Whitwell Wood==\nWhitwell Wood is a large area of ancient woodland covering approximately 171 hectares. It forms part of the Welbeck Estate, one of the former medieval dukeries of Nottinghamshire. The wood is managed on a long term lease by the Forestry Commission. It is a predominantly broad-leaved wood with over 20 species indicating ancient woodland, a number of interesting archaeological features and a freshwater spring known as the Ginny Spring. The spring is designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This designation is partly due to the varied flora, but also because of a number of species that are rare in the region. As such, the wood has a very high nature conservation status. A [[Three Shire Oak]] once stood in a field adjacent to Whitwell Wood. The oak traditionally marked the meeting point of the borders of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. However, the tree actually stood some distance to the south of the actual border, which is located closer to the Nottinghamshire village of [[Shireoaks]].\n\n=== Whitwell Gap (Hwitan Wylles Geat) - Creswell Crags ===\nUntil Creswell village was developed by the colliery company in the late 19th Century, Creswell Crags was known locally as Whitwell Crags.Up until this time , there were only a few farms around the entrance to the Crags.The nearest local Anglo Saxon villages were Whitwell, Elmton & Thorpe (Salvin). According to a local resident whose relatives lived in the farms close to the Crags,  Creswell was only the name of the farm nearest to the new colliery site, and used as a drop off point for materials used in the building of the colliery.  The original name of the Crags (Whitwell Crags) may be the  location referred to by the Anglo Saxon poets who recorded King Alfred's grandson, King Edmund conquering the 5 Boroughs from the Viking Earls in 942 AD, reaching as far as Dore & \"Hwitan Wylles Geat\" (the Whitwell Gap). Whitwell Gap would have to be a significant landscape feature to warrant mention in an Anglo Saxon chronicle, and be easily identifiable.\n\n==Famous Whitwellians==\nOne of Whitwell's most famous sons was [[Joe Davis]], world snooker and billiards champion from the 1920s to the 1940s. His Whitwell home (on Welbeck Street) bears a plaque commemorating him.\n\n[[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]], [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]]<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/859/859.html Les Jackson at CricketArchive.com]</ref> in 1959, played for Whitwell Cricket Club and came to watch their games on a Saturday afternoon until his death in 2007.\n\nAlso from the village are [[Chris Adams (cricketer)|Chris Adams]], the [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Ian Bennett (footballer)|Ian Bennett]], a professional goalkeeper who currently plays for [[Huddersfield Town]], whose family still lives in the village.\n\nCelebrated Great War poet, William Streets was also from the village.\n\nThe village is the birthplace and childhood home of [[J. T. Edson]] the author, whose various escapism-adventure series sold over 27 million copies globally; the Edson family lived in Whitwell from Victorian times.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Whitwell, Derbyshire}}\n*[http://www.whitwell-pc.gov.uk/ Whitwell Parish Council]\n*[http://www.whitwell.info/ Whitwell Parish Website]\n*[http://www.whitwell.com/ Whitwell Website]\n*[http://whitwellderbyscc.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp Whitwell Cricket Club's Website]\n*[http://www.wlhg.co.uk/ Whitwell Local History Group's Website]\n*[http://www.whitwellbrassband.org.uk/ Whitwell Brass Band]\n*[http://www.whitwell4ward.org.uk/ Whitwell Forward]\n*[http://www.whitwellagainstalkane.info/ Whitwell Against Alkane (Action Group against Alkane Energy)]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Derbyshire]]\n[[Category:Bolsover District]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{infobox UK place\n|country = England\n|coordinates  = {{coord|53.285|-1.209|display=inline,title}}\n|static_image_name =608434 4e55cf25-by-Richard-Croft.jpg\n|static_image_caption=[[St Lawrence's Church, Whitwell|Church of St Lawrence, Whitwell.]]\n|official_name= Whitwell\n|map_type= Derbyshire\n|population = 3,900\n|population_ref = (2011)\n|shire_district= [[Bolsover (district)|Bolsover]]\n|shire_county = [[Derbyshire]]\n|region= East Midlands\n|constituency_westminster= [[Bolsover (UK Parliament constituency)|Bolsover]]\n|post_town= WORKSOP\n|postcode_district = S80\n|postcode_area= S\n|dial_code= 01909\n|os_grid_reference= SK528767\n}}\n\n'''Whitwell''' is a small village located in [[Derbyshire]], England.
