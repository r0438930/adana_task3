It has one [[Administrative subdivision|sub-division]], 11 [[Tehsils|tahasils]] and 11 [[Block (country subdivision)|blocks]] and comprises 1722 revenue villages. Puri is the only [[Nagar Palika|municipality]] of the district. Konark, Pipili and Nimapara are the three [[Nagar Panchayat|NAC]]s in this district. Satyabadi, Gop, Kakatpur and Brahmagiri are major semi-urban areas.\n\n==Name==\nThe district is named after its capital town, [[Puri]]. In [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]], the word \"Puri\" means town or city. The town is an important seat of [[Vaishnavism]], and is home to the noted [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] built by [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]] in the mid 12th century CE.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/articles/patachitra/index.html|title=Pata-chitras of Orissa|last=Cesarone|first=Bernard|date=May 16, 2001|website=www.asianart.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-history===\nLike many other parts of [[Odisha]], the Puri district contains [[Pleistocene]] river gravels and silts. So far, no prehistoric stone tools have been found in this region, although they are found in similar formations (river gravels, secondary [[laterite]] pits and murrams) in the nearby districts of [[Dhenkanal district|Dhenkanal]], [[Mayurbhanj district|Mayurbhanj]],  [[Kendujhar district|Kendujhar]] and [[Sundergarh district|Sundergarh]].\n\n===Early records===\nIn the dramatic poem [[Anarghar\u0101ghava]], believed to date from approximately the 9th century CE, the town of Puri was called Purusottama. The name of the town is given as Purusottama Kshetra in the records of [[Anangabhima Deva III]] from the 13th century CE. The town was given this name, or Purusottama Chhatar or simply Chhatar, in the records of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Maratha Empire]], and the early British rulers. In the [[Yogini Tantra]] and the [[Kalika Purana]] the town is referred to as Purusottam, and the Puri region was known as [[Utkal]].\n\nPurusottama Kshetra became referred to as Purusottama Puri, then contracted into Kshetra or Chhatra, or simply Puri. In many early [[British Raj|British]] records this town is known by the name Pooree.\n\n===History of the District as an administrative unit===\nUnder Mughal Rule (1592\u20131751), [[Odisha]] was divided into three circars for the purpose of revenue administration, Jaleswar, Bhadrak and Kataka. Current-day Puri was part of Kataka circar. After the Marathas occupied Odisha in 1751, they divided Odisha into the Pipli, Kataka, Soro and Balasore chakalas. The chakala of Pipli included major portions of the modern district of Puri.\n\nAfter the conquest of Odisha by the British in 1803, the province was divided into the Northern and Southern Divisions with the river Mahanadi forming the boundary. Robert Ker and Charles Groeme were appointed as judge, magistrate, and collector in Northern and Southern Divisions respectively. By 1805 both divisions were amalgamated; Groeme was replaced, and Ker became the judge and magistrate of the whole province. By 1818 the Office of the Commissioner was established and Robert Ker became the first commissioner.\n\nIn October 1828, the province was divided into three districts, Balasore, Cuttack and Jagannath, which was later renamed Puri. In 1912, the new province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] was formed, including these three districts. [[Odisha|Orissa]] (now Odisha) became a separate province in 1936 and was merged with the states of Nayagarh, Daspalla, Khandapara and Ranapur in 1948. A separate sub-division comprising these ex-states was added to Puri district, with headquarters at Nayagarh. Bhubaneswar was merged with the district in 1959. At this point the district comprised four sub-divisions: Puri Sadar, Khurdha, Bhubaneswar and Nayagarh.\n\nBy 1995, the area previously known as the Puri district was divided into three new districts:\n\n* [[Nayagarh District|Nayagarh district]], comprising the old Nayagarh sub-division;\n* [[Khordha District|Khordha district]], comprising the old Khuradha and Bhubaneswar sub-divisions; and\n* [[Puri District|Puri district]], comprising the old Puri Sadar sub-division.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Puri district lies around the latitudes 19\u00b0 and longitudes 84\u00b029'E. It has a geographical area of 3051&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 264988 Ha. It has varied geographical and geological divisions defined by rock types, soil, vegetation, water bodies and climate. The primary geological division is between the littoral tract and the level alluvial tract.\n\n'''i) The littoral tract''': This strip of the country lies between the level alluvial tract and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Strong monsoon currents blow over the country for nearly 8 months of the year, producing sandy ridges parallel to the coast, varying from 6.5&nbsp;km to a few hundred metres in width. These ridges stretch along the seashore for the full length of the sea coast, approximately150&nbsp;km long. The littoral tract forms the dividing line between the [[Chilika Lake]] and the ocean.\n\n'''ii) The level alluvial tract:''' The alluvial region is full of villages and [[Paddy field|rice fields]], watered by a network of channels, through which the distributaries of the most southerly branch of the [[Mahanadi]] river find their way to the sea.\n\n===River system===\nThe rivers of Puri district are generally tributaries of the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]] river. They are largely dry or small streams in the hot season, while in the rains they receive more water than they can carry. Major rivers include:\n\n1) [[Kushabhadra River]]: A branch of the [[Kuakhai River]] originates from Balianta and meets the Bay of Bengal at the shrine of Ramachandi, located 15 miles east of [[Puri]]. Its tributary Mugei joins with Kushabhadra.\n\n2) [[Daya River]]: A branch of the Kuakhai river drains into the [[Chilika]] lake. Two small rivers, the Gangua and the Managuni, join with the Daya river below Kanas. The Daya river is believed to be the cause of silt build-up in Chilika Lake.\n\n3) [[Bhargavi River]]: A branch of the Kuakhai river meets the Bay of Bengal after breaking up into numerous tributaries in the last two and a half miles of its course. Four main branches, the Kanchi, the East Kania, the Naya Nadi and the South Kanchi (which drains into Sar Lake) all derive from the left bank of the Kuakhai. The first three of these interconnect through several channels and finally join the Suna Munhi river, which in turn joins the Baliharchandi and ultimately drains to the Bay of Bengal via the mouth of Chilika. The South Kania dissipates in the marshes on the western shore of Chilika.\n\n4) [[Kadua River]]: This is a [[monsoon]] fed river that drains into the [[Prachi River]].\n\n5) [[Prachi River]]: This river has its origin near Kantapara on Cuttack-Gop road and passes through the village of [[Kakatpur]] before draining into the Bay of Bengal.\n\n6) [[Devi River]]: This is a branch of the [[Kathajodi River]].[[Image:Chilika lake.png|right|thumb|200px|Map of [[lake Chilka]] with near-by settlement of [[Puri]].]]\n\n===Beaches===\nNotable beaches include: Puri Beach; the Golden Beach; Beleswar Beach; Swargadwar Beach; Balighai Beach; and the Chandrabhaga Sea Beach.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=5,27,283|13=1911|14=5,37,636|15=1921|16=4,83,649|17=1931|18=5,35,934|19=1941|20=5,79,192|21=1951|22=6,25,148|23=1961|24=7,36,118|25=1971|26=9,03,807|27=1981|28=11,05,471|29=1991|30=13,05,365|31=2001|32=15,02,682|33=2011|34=16,98,730|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}According to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Puri district had a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 1,698,730,<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref> roughly equal to the nation of [[Guinea-Bissau]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote =\nGuinea-Bissau 1,596,677 July 2011 est.\n }}</ref> or the US state of [[Idaho]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=2010 Resident Population Data|publisher=U.

Nata mandiras are typically decorated with figures in various poses of dance and musicians playing a variety of instruments.\n\n====Odissi dance====\n{{Main| Odissi dance}}\n[[image:Sharmila Biswas, Odissi dancer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sharmila Biswas]] performing Odissi in a dance festival in Kerala]]\n\nOdissi dance is an ancient [[Indian classical dance]] form that originated in the [[Hindu temple]]s of Odisha. Traditionally this dance form was taught to the [[devadasi]] (female temple dancers). In Odissi dances, the artists play out a mythical story, a spiritual message or devotional poem from the [[Hindu texts]], such as [[Jayadeva|Jayadev]]'s [[Gita Govinda]]. After the abolition of the devadasi system, the traditional forms of the dance fell into disuse. Padmashri Guru [[Kelucharan Mahapatra]] was one of the gurus who revived the Odissi dance form in the mid-20th century.\n\n'''[[Orissi music]]'''\n\nOrissi music is a genre of Indian classical music originating from Puri. It is believed to date back to the 2nd century BCE, when [[Kharavela]], king of Odisha, acted as a patron for this form of music and dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410055911/http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/august-2007/engpdf/Page108-111.pdf|title=Odissi - The Classic Music|last=Mohanty|first=Gopinath|date=August 2007|website=Wayback Machine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n====Mahari dance====\nMahari is a ritualistic dance form that was historically performed at the temple of [[Lord Jagannatha]] at [[Puri]] by devadasi dancers called maharis. After the abolition of the [[devadasi system]], it is no longer danced at the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannatha Temple]] but continues as a cultural dance.\n\n====== Folk dances ======\n'''[[Gotipua]] dance''' is a folk dance of Puri, danced by boys under 14 years old, clad in female dress. The boys perform acrobatic figures inspired by the life of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]]. The village of [[Raghurajpur]] is known for its Gotipua dance troupes.\n\n'''Naga dances''' are danced by men wearing a heavy, elaborate costume including huge, highly decorated headgear and a false beard almost covering the face.\n\n'''Medha dances''' are traditional dances in which the dancers wear a huge [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] mask representing a demon or other character. Medha dancers participate in processions of temple idols on festival days such as [[Rama Navami]].\n\n====Other folk dances====\nOther folk dances common in the district include Ghoda nacha, Dhuduki nacha, Jatra, Pala, Daskathia, Bhalu nacha, Mankada nacha and [[Navrang]].\n\n===Other notable sites===\n\n====Archeological Sites====\nExcavated archeological sites in Puri district include:\n\n* Kuruma, or Kurum.

It has one [[Administrative subdivision|sub-division]], 11 [[Tehsils|tahasils]] and 11 [[Block (country subdivision)|blocks]] and comprises 1722 revenue villages. Puri is the only [[Nagar Palika|municipality]] of the district. Konark, Pipili and Nimapara are the three [[Nagar Panchayat|NAC]]s in this district. Satyabadi, Gop, Kakatpur and Brahmagiri are major semi-urban areas.\n\n==Name==\nThe district is named after its capital town, [[Puri]]. In [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]], the word \"Puri\" means town or city. The town is an important seat of [[Vaishnavism]], and is home to the noted [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] built by [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]] in the mid 12th century CE.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/articles/patachitra/index.html|title=Pata-chitras of Orissa|last=Cesarone|first=Bernard|date=May 16, 2001|website=www.asianart.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref> \n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-history===\nLike many other parts of [[Odisha]], the Puri district contains [[Pleistocene]] river gravels and silts. So far, no prehistoric stone tools have been found in this region, although they are found in similar formations (river gravels, secondary [[laterite]] pits and murrams) in the nearby districts of [[Dhenkanal district|Dhenkanal]], [[Mayurbhanj district|Mayurbhanj]],  [[Kendujhar district|Kendujhar]] and [[Sundergarh district|Sundergarh]].\n\n===Early records===\nIn the dramatic poem [[Anarghar\u0101ghava]], believed to date from approximately the 9th century CE, the town of Puri was called Purusottama. The name of the town is given as Purusottama Kshetra in the records of [[Anangabhima Deva III]] from the 13th century CE. The town was given this name, or Purusottama Chhatar or simply Chhatar, in the records of the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Maratha Empire]], and the early British rulers. In the [[Yogini Tantra]] and the [[Kalika Purana]] the town is referred to as Purusottam, and the Puri region was known as [[Utkal]].\n\nPurusottama Kshetra became referred to as Purusottama Puri, then contracted into Kshetra or Chhatra, or simply Puri. In many early [[British Raj|British]] records this town is known by the name Pooree. \n\n===History of the District as an administrative unit===\nUnder Mughal Rule (1592\u20131751), [[Odisha]] was divided into three circars for the purpose of revenue administration, Jaleswar, Bhadrak and Kataka. Current-day Puri was part of Kataka circar. After the Marathas occupied Odisha in 1751, they divided Odisha into the Pipli, Kataka, Soro and Balasore chakalas. The chakala of Pipli included major portions of the modern district of Puri. \n\nAfter the conquest of Odisha by the British in 1803, the province was divided into the Northern and Southern Divisions with the river Mahanadi forming the boundary. Robert Ker and Charles Groeme were appointed as judge, magistrate, and collector in Northern and Southern Divisions respectively. By 1805 both divisions were amalgamated; Groeme was replaced, and Ker became the judge and magistrate of the whole province. By 1818 the Office of the Commissioner was established and Robert Ker became the first commissioner. \n\nIn October 1828, the province was divided into three districts, Balasore, Cuttack and Jagannath, which was later renamed Puri. In 1912, the new province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] was formed, including these three districts. [[Odisha|Orissa]] (now Odisha) became a separate province in 1936 and was merged with the states of Nayagarh, Daspalla, Khandapara and Ranapur in 1948. A separate sub-division comprising these ex-states was added to Puri district, with headquarters at Nayagarh. Bhubaneswar was merged with the district in 1959. At this point the district comprised four sub-divisions: Puri Sadar, Khurdha, Bhubaneswar and Nayagarh.\n\nBy 1995, the area previously known as the Puri district was divided into three new districts:\n\n* [[Nayagarh District|Nayagarh district]], comprising the old Nayagarh sub-division;\n* [[Khordha District|Khordha district]], comprising the old Khuradha and Bhubaneswar sub-divisions; and\n* [[Puri District|Puri district]], comprising the old Puri Sadar sub-division.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Puri district lies around the latitudes 19\u00b0 and longitudes 84\u00b029'E. It has a geographical area of 3051&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 264988 Ha. It has varied geographical and geological divisions defined by rock types, soil, vegetation, water bodies and climate. The primary geological division is between the littoral tract and the level alluvial tract.\n\n'''i) The littoral tract''': This strip of the country lies between the level alluvial tract and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Strong monsoon currents blow over the country for nearly 8 months of the year, producing sandy ridges parallel to the coast, varying from 6.5&nbsp;km to a few hundred metres in width. These ridges stretch along the seashore for the full length of the sea coast , approximately150&nbsp;km long. The littoral tract forms the dividing line between the [[Chilika Lake]] and the ocean.\n\n'''ii) The level alluvial tract:''' The alluvial region is full of villages and [[Paddy field|rice fields]], watered by a network of channels, through which the distributaries of the most southerly branch of the [[Mahanadi]] river find their way to the sea. \n\n===River system===\nThe rivers of Puri district are generally tributaries of the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]] river. They are largely dry or small streams in the hot season, while in the rains they receive more water than they can carry. Major rivers include:\n\n1) [[Kushabhadra River]]: A branch of the [[Kuakhai River]] originates from Balianta and meets the Bay of Bengal at the shrine of Ramachandi, located 15 miles east of [[Puri]]. Its tributary Mugei joins with Kushabhadra.\n\n2) [[Daya River]]: A branch of the Kuakhai river drains into the [[Chilika]] lake. Two small rivers, the Gangua and the Managuni, join with the Daya river below Kanas. The Daya river is believed to be the cause of silt build-up in Chilika Lake.\n\n3) [[Bhargavi River]]: A branch of the Kuakhai river meets the Bay of Bengal after breaking up into numerous tributaries in the last two and a half miles of its course. Four main branches, the Kanchi, the East Kania, the Naya Nadi and the South Kanchi (which drains into Sar Lake) all derive from the left bank of the Kuakhai. The first three of these interconnect through several channels and finally join the Suna Munhi river, which in turn joins the Baliharchandi and ultimately drains to the Bay of Bengal via the mouth of Chilika. The South Kania dissipates in the marshes on the western shore of Chilika.\n\n4) [[Kadua River]]: This is a [[monsoon]] fed river that drains into the [[Prachi River]].\n\n5) [[Prachi River]]: This river has its origin near Kantapara on Cuttack-Gop road and passes through the village of [[Kakatpur]] before draining into the Bay of Bengal.\n\n6) [[Devi River]]: This is a branch of the [[Kathajodi River]].[[Image:Chilika lake.png|right|thumb|200px|Map of [[lake Chilka]] with near-by settlement of [[Puri]].]]\n\n<br />\n\n===Beaches===\nNotable beaches include: Puri Beach; the Golden Beach; Beleswar Beach; Swargadwar Beach; Balighai Beach; and the Chandrabhaga Sea Beach.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=5,27,283|13=1911|14=5,37,636|15=1921|16=4,83,649|17=1931|18=5,35,934|19=1941|20=5,79,192|21=1951|22=6,25,148|23=1961|24=7,36,118|25=1971|26=9,03,807|27=1981|28=11,05,471|29=1991|30=13,05,365|31=2001|32=15,02,682|33=2011|34=16,98,730|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}According to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Puri district had a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 1,698,730,<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref> roughly equal to the nation of [[Guinea-Bissau]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote =\nGuinea-Bissau 1,596,677 July 2011 est.\n }}</ref> or the US state of [[Idaho]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=2010 Resident Population Data|publisher=U.

Nata mandiras are typically decorated with figures in various poses of dance and musicians playing a variety of instruments.\n\n====Odissi dance====\n{{Main| Odissi dance}}\n[[image:Sharmila Biswas, Odissi dancer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sharmila Biswas]] performing Odissi in a dance festival in Kerala]]\n\nOdissi dance is an ancient [[Indian classical dance]] form that originated in the [[Hindu temple|Hindu temples]] of Odisha. Traditionally this dance form was taught to the [[devadasi]] (female temple dancers). In Odissi dances, the artists play out a mythical story, a spiritual message or devotional poem from the [[Hindu texts]], such as [[Jayadeva|Jayadev]]'s [[Gita Govinda]]. After the abolition of the devadasi system, the traditional forms of the dance fell into disuse. Padmashri Guru [[Kelucharan Mahapatra]] was one of the gurus who revived the Odissi dance form in the mid-20th century.\n\n'''[[Orissi music]]'''\n\nOrissi music is a genre of Indian classical music originating from Puri. It is believed to date back to the 2nd century BCE, when [[Kharavela]], king of Odisha, acted as a patron for this form of music and dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410055911/http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/august-2007/engpdf/Page108-111.pdf|title=Odissi - The Classic Music|last=Mohanty|first=Gopinath|date=August 2007|website=Wayback Machine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>\n\n====Mahari dance====\nMahari is a ritualistic dance form that was historically performed at the temple of [[Lord Jagannatha]] at [[Puri]] by devadasi dancers called maharis. After the abolition of the [[devadasi system]], it is no longer danced at the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannatha Temple]] but continues as a cultural dance. \n\n====== Folk dances ======\n'''[[Gotipua]] dance''' is a folk dance of Puri, danced by boys under 14 years old, clad in female dress. The boys perform acrobatic figures inspired by the life of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]]. The village of [[Raghurajpur]] is known for its Gotipua dance troupes. \n\n'''Naga dances''' are danced by men wearing a heavy, elaborate costume including huge, highly decorated headgear and a false beard almost covering the face.  \n\n'''Medha dances''' are traditional dances in which the dancers wear a huge [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] mask representing a demon or other character. Medha dancers participate in processions of temple idols on festival days such as [[Rama Navami]]. \n\n====Other folk dances====\nOther folk dances common in the district include Ghoda nacha, Dhuduki nacha, Jatra, Pala, Daskathia, Bhalu nacha, Mankada nacha and [[Navrang]]. \n\n===Other notable sites===\n\n====Archeological Sites====\nExcavated archeological sites in Puri district include:\n\n* Kuruma, or Kurum.
