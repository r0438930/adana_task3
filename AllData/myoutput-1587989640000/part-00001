The second season first aired weekly from August 6, 2006 to October 29, 2006, with a total of twelve episodes.\n\nDuring the [[Flavor of Love (season 1)|first season]] reunion, Hoopz announced that her relationship with Flavor Flav was over, saying \"It's like that, but it's not ''[[intimate relationship|like that]]''.\" When discussing the upcoming season, Flav emphatically told the producers \"No more gold diggers!\" (referring mainly to Hottie from Season One)\n\nFilming began in May 2006 and consisted of an 11 episode season, with another episode for a reunion show.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-flavorofloverenewed,0,7200069.story|title= VH1 Brings the 'Flavor' Again|publisher = zap2it.com}}</ref> [[VH1]] uploaded videos of contestant auditions on [[IFilm]] and encouraged viewers to rank the contestants.\n\nThe show premiered with 3.3 million viewers.<ref>{{cite journal | journal =  [[CableFax]]  | title =  Ratings| first =  | last =  | section =  | page =   | volume = 17 | issue =153   | date = 9 August 2006 }}</ref> The format of the show largely stayed the same as the first season, with the exception of Flav's deliberations with Big Rick as to whom he would keep or send home before the actual ceremony; this angle was dropped during the second season.

in the House of Flav===\n''First aired August 6, 2006''\n\nTwenty new contestants arrive at the mansion and discover that there were only fourteen beds. When H-Town and [[Saaphyri]] fight over a bed, Flav asked them what happened. After finding out who started the fight, Saaphyri is disqualified for physically assaulting H-Town. Flav revealed that he had a spy in his house; this turned out to be Eye'z. She told Flav that Bamma is too quiet, Somethin is crazy, Hood was sent to the show by her agent, Wire was on [[The Fifth Wheel]], Tiger wasn't into Flav, Choclate didn't say much, and Toasteee drinks too much. Later, Somethin shared an intimate moment with Flav, and Spunkeey called her out on lesbian statements she made before. Somethin erupted and begins to scream; the producers added a demonic voice for humorous effect. After the five girls Hood, Bamma, H-Town, Choclate and Saaphyri were eliminated, the contestants discovered that Somethin had defecated on the floor during the elimination ceremony because she couldn't hold it in or go to the bathroom.\n* '''Eliminated:''' Hood, Bamma, H-town, Choclate, Saaphyri\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Hood''': Agent sent her to be on the show.\n*'''Bamma''': Flav said that he wasn't feeling her.\n*'''H-Town''': Got into a fight with Saaphryi and told her to go to a doctor for her injuries.\n*'''Choclate''': Flav claims that he wasn't feeling her.\n*'''Saaphryi''': Got disqualified for assaulting H-Town over a bed.\n\n===Flav is Blind===\n''First aired August 13, 2006''\n\nFlav challenges the remaining fourteen Flavorettes to a blind speed dating competition so he could get to know them without appearance being a factor. Things fell apart when Flav realized he couldn't eat something he couldn't see. The girls were each given ten minutes to leave a lasting impression on Flav as he stumbled from table to table. In the end, Flav chose Tiger, Like Dat, and Buckwild as the winners while indulging in a bucket of [[KFC]].\n\nIn the morning, Buckeey commented on Like Dat's slovenly table manners. Later in the day, the three girls who won the speed dating competition accompanied Flav on a group date to the \"gonzoleers\" ([[gondolas]]) in the [[Long Beach, California|LBC]]. Flavor Flav tried to stick to the tradition of kissing all the girls as they passed under the bridges, however Tiger had no interest in kissing him. She claimed that she didn't like kissing him after other girls. Later that evening, Flav had a mixer, and all went well until Wire watched Buckeey and Flavor Flav kiss. She stood there until Flav asked her to go inside. She then played the piano very loudly and ruined Buckeey's date. Toasteee gave Flavor Flav advice on whom he should eliminate, and he took this into consideration that night in the elimination ceremony. Wire and Spunkeey were both eliminated. Spunkeey cried hard when she was eliminated and was sad that he kept \"the beauty queen over her\" and the \"girls who want to have sex with other girls\". She also said \"I would have shited on your floor if I had to\" as she hugged Flav goodbye.\n*'''Challenge:''' Blind speed dating competition.\n*'''Challenge Winners:''' Tiger, Like Dat, Buckwild\n*'''Bottom Three:''' Somethin, Wire, Spunkeey\n* '''Eliminated:''' Wire, Spunkeey\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Spunkeey''': Acted too fake around him.\n*'''Wire''': Flav claims he wasn't feeling her.\n\n===She Works Hard for Her Honey===\n''First aired August 20, 2006''\n\nFlav divides the girls into two groups. Buckwild, Krazy, Toasteee, Somethin, Bootz, and Deelishis have to work at one of Flav's favorite restaurants. Sumthin gets fired for not taking it seriously, and Bootz wins the challenge. The next day, the second group has to clean a disgusting house after a crazy party the night before. The group consists of Buckeey, Tiger, Payshintz, Nibblz, Beatuful and Like Dat. They find out they are cleaning hip-hop legend [[Warren G]]'s house. While half of the girls are cleaning, back at the mansion Buckwild, Krazy and Deelishis watch as Bootz and Somethin are arguing. The winner is Nibblz, and she and Flav have a king and queen dinner. Bootz and Payshintz then start fighting. Many of the other girls joined in and started making racial comments, furthermore accusing her of not knowing who she or Flav is. Bootz tells Flav that Tiger, Somethin, and Payshintz should all go home. Flav takes this into consideration, and eliminates Tiger and Sumthin. He has a clock for Payshintz as well, but she chooses not to accept it because she couldn't take the drama with Bootz, and a few of the other girls anymore.\n*'''Challenge:''' To work at one of Flav's favorite restaurants (six girls). Clean one of Flav's boy's house (six other girls).\n*'''Challenge Winner:''' Nibblz, Bootz\n*'''Bottom Three:''' Payshintz, Tiger, Somethin\n* '''Eliminated:''' Tiger, Somethin\n* '''Quit:''' Payshintz\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Somethin''': Flav couldn't get over her defecating on the floor and she touched his face.\n*'''Tiger''': Didn't make a connection with her.\n*'''Payshintz''': Quit the competition because she couldn't handle the drama with Bootz and a few of the other girls.\n\n===Jelly on the Telly===\n''First aired August 27, 2006''\n\nThe episode begins on the night of the previous elimination, when Toasteee and Nibblz share Flav's bed that night. In the morning, Flav holds a hip-hop dance contest. The girls are divided into three teams of three each. Krazy, Nibblz, and Deelishis end up winning. Each girl gets a private date with Flav; that night, Krazy goes with him on a romantic candlelit dinner to KFC, Nibblz spends the next morning in his bedroom and has breakfast with him, and Deelishis goes with him to a strawberry field.\n\nIn the meantime, Toasteee tells the other girls that the night before, she heard noises and concluded that Nibblz was giving Flav a [[handjob]]. Nibblz retaliates by revealing to Flav that Toasteee apparently admitted that she has done pornography on the internet and in a magazine. Toasteee denies the allegations, so Flav does some internet research to see who's lying. Toasteee goes to Flav, letting him know that she's leaving because she can't handle the drama anymore. Flav tells Toasteee that if she leaves now, she's basically implying that Nibblz was right. Toasteee agrees to stay. In that evening's eliminations, Flav has both girls promise they're telling the truth. But right after that, Flav holds up a pornographic picture of Toasteee. Everyone is shocked by the evidence. Toasteee claims that it's not necessarily evidence against her as she leaves.\n\n*'''Challenge:''' A hip-hop dance contest divided by three teams.\n*'''Challenge Winners:''' Krazy, Nibblz, Deelishis\n*'''Bottom two:''' Nibblz, Toasteee\n* '''Eliminated:''' Toastee\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Toasteee''': Lied to Flav about doing porn.\n\n===Famous Friends and Strangeness===\n''First aired September 3, 2006''\n\nThis episode starts with the girls finding out that they must throw a party for some of Flav's famous friends. Like Dat confronts Buckwild about her speech patterns, claiming that she is talking like she's black and that it isn't how she really talks, but Buckwild says that she's not a fake. Bootz, Like Dat, and Buckwild get into a fight about Buckeey and Deelishis not working hard. After all the fights, the girls are excited to find out who will be coming to the party. The special guests are [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Warren G]], [[Don Magic Juan]], [[DJ Quik]], [[Ying Yang Twins|the Ying Yang Twins]], and [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Young Buck]] of [[G-Unit]]. When the guests first arrive Bootz entertain them with her booty dancing, and Nibblz gives them [[lap dances]]. The Ying Yang Twins ask Bootz to dance in one of their videos and she declines because she didn't want to risk her relationship with Flav. During the party, Nibblz drinks too much [[liquor]] and is in the bathroom [[vomiting]], resulting in Like Dat having to lay her down on her bed. Also, Three 6 Mafia asks Krazy to sing any of Flav's songs. She says she knows one of them, but she can't sing it. Bootz and Krazy have an argument about Krazy being real or not. Like Dat and Buckwild then get into the same argument again. Buckwild says that when she is around different races of people, her voice changes. She then wants to leave but Like Dat convinces her to stay. Flav spends time with Buckeey, Bootz, and Like Dat before elimination. However, Like Dat is sent home because Flav only sees her as a friend. The girls are then pissed to find out that another guest will be joining them tomorrow: Season 1's Tiffany \"New York\" Pollard.\n* '''Challenge:''' To throw a party and interact with some of Flav's friends.\n* '''Challenge winner:''' None\n* '''Eliminated:''' Like Dat\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Like Dat''': Only saw her as a friend.\n\n===Photo Shoot To The Death===\n''First aired September 10, 2006''\n\nThe episode begins the night, that Flav welcomes Season 1's [[Tiffany Pollard]] aka New York back to the house as a guest to help him decide about tomorrow night's eliminations for the seven remaining ladies. All the girls are pissed that New York returned to the house, because they hold New York in contempt. Flav leaves the girls alone and New York asks the girls about each other and Bootz lets New York know that she doesn't like her and doesn't want her there and that she's just another bitch trying to steal her man. New York and Bootz get into an argument, where New York calls Bootz a \"dreamer\" meaning she's just dreaming of Flav being her man. The next day, the girls wake up and are told to go to a photoshoot for URB Magazine. New York is in charge of how the women look. New York is yelling at everybody because they were late and screams to them to come down stairs. New York gets into an argument with Bootz when Bootz is late coming downstairs for the evaluation. New York has mean things to say to all of them (except Deelishis and Beautful).\n\nThe girls head to the photoshoot and New York is once again giving the girls nasty comments. After the photoshoot, Buckwild and New York get into a fight over Buckwild being \"darker than what she is\". Flav steps in and takes Buckwild's side. New York runs out crying and feels disrespected by Flav. Meanwhile, the girls are upset that New York is there and Krazy decides to call her out. The two fight because Krazy is saying that New York is not in control of elimination and New York went on top of the table and touched her on the head which lead Flav to come and stop it.\n\nFlav then takes New York and asks her about each of the girls. She wonders if Buckwild is actually there to be in a romantic relationship with Flav. She feels that Buckeey lacks energy. Nibblz is filthy and too sexual. New York believes that both Bootz and Deelishis are there to be with him, while she believes that Krazy is there for the wrong reasons.\n\nBack at the house, Krazy calls Deelishis out when Deelishis spreads the word that Krazy is fake to all of the girls back at the photoshoot.\n\nAt eliminations, New York states that Krazy, Beatuful and Nibblz should go home. Flav eliminates Beatuful because she is too laid back and Nibblz because she wouldn't fit with his children. Krazy gets her clock. Flav has a surprise and invites New York back as a full-time competitor. The girls are pissed and Buckwild returns her clock because New York returned and she was afraid she would violate her probation with New York there. Her urban style of speech that had been a point of contention earlier in the season disappeared during the elimination ceremony, making Flav and the other contestants certain that she had been faking it all along. \n* '''Brought back:''' [[Tiffany Pollard|Tiffany 'New York' Pollard]]\n* '''Challenge:''' A photo shoot for Urb Magazine.\n* '''Challenge winner:''' None\n* '''Bottom Three:''' Krazy, Beatuful, Nibblz\n* '''Eliminated:''' Beatuful, Nibblz\n* '''Quit:''' Buckwild\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Beatuful''': Flav said she was too laid back and not aggressive.\n*'''Nibblz''': Flav said she wasn't a good example for his kids and said that his kids won't be comfortable with their father being with a stripper.\n*'''Buckwild''': Quit the competition because she didn't want to have to deal with New York being there.\n\n===Boxin' Each Other Out===\n''First aired September 17, 2006''\n\nFive girls remaining: [[Tiffany Pollard|New York]], Krazy, Bootz, Buckeey, and Deelishis. Flav instructs them to put pictures of the two girls they think most deserve elimination into a box. They choose Krazy and New York, and as a result, neither of them get dates that evening. They pick Krazy because they think she is fake. New York is picked because she came on the show later than the others, and they felt that she wouldn't be a good mom for Flav's children. Flav takes Buckeey on a date to a bowling alley and teaches her how to bowl. For his second date, Flav has a romantic evening with Bootz in the backyard. But Bootz tells Flav that she is going to wait until she marries to have sex. Flav is shocked and upset by this. The next day, Deelishis is getting ready for her date when New York comes in and argues with her for saying that New York is fake.\n\nBig Rick must come in to break up the fight. When New York leaves, she says that she just ruined Deelishis' date. However, Deelishis and Flav have a great time on an exotic camel ride date. Buckeey and Krazy then get into a dangerous fight when she hears Krazy talking bad about her, Bootz, and Deelishis to New York. Krazy supposedly pushes Buckeey, to which Buckeey responds by almost pushing Krazy off of the second-floor outside balcony. New York laughs and tries to break them apart. At the elimination ceremony, Buckeey is eliminated for almost killing Krazy. New York then states her plan, which is that Deelishis and Bootz will be her next \"victims\". She also says that Krazy thinks that they are friends, but New York is just using her to eliminate the other girls.\n* '''Challenge:''' To put pictures of the two girls they think most deserve elimination into a box.\n* '''Challenge winners:''' Buckeey, Bootz, Deelishis\n* '''Bottom two:''' Buckeey, Krazy\n* '''Eliminated:''' Buckeey\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Buckeey''': For assaulting Krazy by almost pushing her off the balcony.\n\n===Steppin' Out Flav Style===\n''First aired September 24, 2006''\n\nWith the four remaining women, the episode begins with Bootz and Deelishis still in their beds discussing their disdain for [[Tiffany Pollard|New York]] and Krazy. Then all the girls go downstairs where Rick delivers the Flav-O-Gram which New York reads. Flav pairs Deelishis and Krazy for the first date to LBC. As usual New York becomes openly upset and goes upstairs. After she leaves Deelishis snidely says that New York is a \"loony\" and begins to read the Flav-O-Gram aloud again and discovers that New York said slicking where the Flav-O-Gram said slicing. Soon afterward Deelishis follows New York to the balcony where she is standing visibly upset that she hasn't had a date with Flav in four days. The conversation is short but almost escalates into a confrontation after Deelishis tells New York to redirect her hostility. After the discussion Krazy and Deelishis set off for their date with Flav. When they get there Flav greets them and the two climb aboard the yacht. Flav eventually makes out with Deelishis, which upsets Krazy. But soon Deelishis leaves Flav's side, seasick. Krazy and Flav speak intimately. After they get off the yacht Flav takes the girls to the [[RMS Queen Mary]] for accommodations where the girls prepare for dinner. During dinner Flav asks Krazy how she feels about him and what she feels they share in common. When she fails to answer appropriately, he asks her to sing. She says she would love a record deal, but doesn't have the money. Afterward he asks Deelishis how she feels about him. Deelishis declares her feelings for him, through tears. Flav decides to spend the night with Deelishis. Flav turns and bids farewell to Krazy but mistakenly calls her Deelishis. Deelishis and Flav retire to their room where eventually they fall asleep together.\n\nThe next day New York and Bootz meet Flav at a [[winery]] where a woman brings them three horses. Bootz gets on her horse up immediately but New York is hesitant and panics. Eventually all three of them go for a ride through the winery fields. They stop at a beautiful spread where they sip wine and Flav tells Bootz he is really feeling her. Naturally New York is angry. Tensions rise but soon all three wind up stomping grapes together. After they shower they leave the winery and go to the [[Pechanga Resort and Casino]] where Bootz and New York prepare for dinner. During the date all Flav's attention goes to Bootz. New York feels ignored and demands attention, then storms off. Flav gives chase and asks her to spend the night with him, which New York later reveals was her plan. Bootz and New York then argue over dinner. After dinner they leave for their room and New York reveals that she again had sex with Flav.\n\nAfter the two dates they are all faced yet again with the elimination ceremony. The first clock goes to New York, the second goes to Deelishis and the third goes to Krazy, despite Flav's worries about her intentions, he feels that they have a strong connection. Flav then eliminates Bootz because she said she wouldn't have sex with him until she is married. But before she leaves, she gives him her phone number for him to call her when \"he gets sick of those ho's\".\n* '''Bottom two:''' Krazy, Bootz\n* '''Eliminated:''' Bootz\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Bootz''': Flav felt that he couldn't be with someone who was waiting until marriage to have sex with and that her connection wasn't as strong as the connection that he had with Krazy\n\n===Family Flavors===\n''First aired October 1, 2006'' (3.99M viewers)<ref>{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Nielsen Ratings for Cable Networks |date=6 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nFlav decides to have the three remaining girls' parents come over so he can get to know them. Hours before the remaining girls' parents arrive, everyone is cleaning and preparing rooms for the parents. Suddenly New York is bothering Deelishis because she believed that Deelishis intentionally took the room that New York chose her parents to stay in. Deelishis, unknowing of what New York is so upset about, has a brief confrontation with New York over who gets the room. Then Deelishis' parents arrive. Flav immediately likes Deelishis's parents. New York's parents arrive and as was shown from Season 1, New York's mother doesn't like Flav. This leads to a confrontation early on, and we discover that New York's mother will do anything to keep her daughter from being together with Flav, even fake a terminal illness. Flav then invites his six children and two grandchildren to the house to get their input on who would make a better stepmother. Later, he takes the women and their mothers over on separate dates: Deelishis and her parents go to a magic show and dinner; Krazy, her mother, and her grandmother go to the hair salon; and Flav orders an assortment of soul food for New York and her parents. That night during elimination, Flav eliminates Krazy because he suspects she is only on the show to further her singing career. At the end, he announces that Deelishis and New York will be going to [[Placencia]], [[Belize]] the next day. The show ends with New York's mother yelling, insisting that New York is coming home right now. New York, however, does not leave the mansion.\n* '''Eliminated:''' Krazy\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Krazy''': Flav felt that she was only on the show to promote her singing career.\n\n===Oh No She Didn't!===\n''First aired October 8, 2006'' (2.7M viewers)<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |title=Viewer numbers down the hatch |first=Gary |last=Levin |department=Life |page=D.4 |date=11 October 2006 |access-date=26 September 2010 |url=http://usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-10-10-nielsen-analysis_x.htm}}</ref>\n\nThis episode shows highlights of the second season with unseen footage. The pivotal quote of perhaps the entire series took place during the unseen footage aired on this episode. New York's mother, Michelle, told Deelishis that her [[Buttocks|posterior]] was so large that she was capable of moving her bowels for an entire year. Deelishis had no comment. There was a scene where Flav was in a photo shoot with some girls from Flavor of Love Season 1. He said, \"I'd throw all of y'alls in my crib, except Hottie.\"\n\n===Flav Belize In Love===\n''First aired October 15, 2006''\n\nThe episode begins where Episode 9 ended, when Flav announced the two remaining girls were going to Placencia, Belize. New York's mother knocks on Flav's door and informs him that she is going to get her daughter out of the mansion, but gets nothing more than a rise from Flav and New York. New York's mother then ends up leaving, but not before she tells Flav that he can't marry her daughter (to which Flav responds that if he asked New York, she would marry him).\n\nThe next day it's New York's turn, and she and Flav go on a small cruise liner. There is a misunderstanding between the two when New York makes remarks that suggest that she wants to take control of his life and money; Flav thinks New York is sounding like her mother. However, later New York apologizes for what she said, and decides to accept Flav's decision-making power. That night, Flav invites her to his hotel room for a nightcap. At first she declines, but later decides that she can't put up with the hurt going on inside, and eventually accepts.\n\nThe following night, amid a rainstorm, the two girls are invited to the dock where Flav makes his final decision. Flav talks about his feelings for the two girls, both what he likes and what he dislikes. In the end, Flav decides that Deelishis is the winner. New York, angry that she lost again, starts a vulgarity-laced outburst towards Flav, resulting in the two trading insults. After [[mooning]] Flav, she says that she no longer has feelings for him and will someday find \"another man who is right for me\". While storming off and sobbing uncontrollably, she says to the camera, \"Do I look like I give a fuck cause I don't\". She also says she wishes that one day she will find the man of her dreams. Flav gives Deelishis a shiny gold grill to match his, and he says he can't wait to meet Deelishis' daughter Jasmine (as he has a daughter with the same name).\n* '''Winner:''' Deelishis\n* '''Runner up:''' New York\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''New York''': Flav already had a strong connection with New York and said everything was going good until they were in Belize, spending time together on the boat and said that New York sounded \"like her mother\" and New York has jealous ways.\n\n===Reunion: After the Lovin'===\n''First aired October 29, 2006''\n\nThe twenty-one women from the second season reunite on stage. [[La La (entertainer)|La La]] hosts once again. She introduces all the girls (with the exception of Deelishis and New York, who arrive later, and Eye'z and Payshintz, who did not show up). After this introduction, La La asks Saaphyri and H-Town to come up on stage and discuss the fight they had, after showing the tape of it. Saaphyri says H-Town threw flowers at her, meaning she couldn't do anything about it. Saaphyri later admits to having gone to anger management classes, in consideration of Flav saying she was too violent. She later says she got a certificate, which amuses everyone. Later, Goldie from the first season makes an appearance. She asks Krazy why she thought New York was her friend and says that Somethin is strong for dealing with what happened with her on the show. She also asks Bootz, Buckwild, and Like Dat to do their booty dancing again from the fourth episode. After entertaining the crowd, La La, and the girls, Flavor Flav appears. La La asks Krazy to come up on stage, and she asks if Krazy thought being on the show helped or hurt her career. She says \"it helped us all in our own way.\" Next, Krazy sings for Flav and appears to have mostly negative receptions.\n\nThen Flav asks Deelishis to come out. They state that they have been apart for four months so that no one would know the outcome of the show. La La asks what Nibblz thought of his decision. She says Deelishis was a great choice for him and she has a \"fabulous ass\". Deelishis' daughter Jasmine meets Flav for the first time, but this moment doesn't make it onto the final edit of the show.\n\nAfter a few minutes, New York is brought out. Buckwild throws a shoe at New York, which narrowly misses New York's head. La La tells Buckwild to respect her, since she never disrespected anyone and that the shoe almost hit her. Then Saaphyri throws a red bull can at New York. New York, Buckwild, Buckeey, and Saaphyri can be heard confronting each other at a distance. After this warning, La La asks Bootz whether she still wanted to say anything to New York. Bootz and New York then exchange insults, and Bootz tells New York, 'Flav only brought you back to fuck you, 'cause he left your ass twice!\" Bootz then runs backstage. But security grabs Bootz, then New York tries to punch Bootz in the face and is screaming \"come on bitch, come on bitch bring that shit\" veral of the contestants attempt to intervene, and in the end Buckwild, Saaphyri, Buckeey, Bootz, and Deelishis were asked to leave. Deelishis and Saaphyri were later brought back before the reunion concluded.  It was later revealed that New York would be featured on her own show, ''[[I Love New York (TV series)|I Love New York]]'', which premiered in January 2007.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Flavor of Love contestants]]\n\n==After the show==\n* Deelishis ([[Chandra Davis]]) revealed in a special \"Where Are They Now\" that she and Flav were no longer dating.

in the House of Flav===\n''First aired August 6, 2006''\n\nTwenty new contestants arrive at the mansion and discover that there were only fourteen beds. When H-Town and [[Saaphyri]] fight over a bed, Flav asked them what happened. After finding out who started the fight, Saaphyri is disqualified for physically assaulting H-Town. Flav revealed that he had a spy in his house; this turned out to be Eye'z. She told Flav that Bamma is too quiet, Somethin is crazy, Hood was sent to the show by her agent, Wire was on [[The Fifth Wheel]], Tiger wasn't into Flav, Choclate didn't say much, and Toasteee drinks too much. Later, Somethin shared an intimate moment with Flav, and Spunkeey called her out on lesbian statements she made before. Somethin erupted and begins to scream; the producers added a demonic voice for humorous effect. After the five girls Hood, Bamma, H-Town, Choclate and Saaphyri were eliminated, the contestants discovered that Somethin had defecated on the floor during the elimination ceremony because she couldn't hold it in or go to the bathroom.\n* '''Eliminated:''' Hood, Bamma, H-town, Choclate, Saaphyri\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Hood''': Agent sent her to be on the show.\n*'''Bamma''': Flav said that he wasn't feeling her.\n*'''H-Town''': Got into a fight with Saaphryi and told her to go to a doctor for her injuries.\n*'''Choclate''': Flav claims that he wasn't feeling her.\n*'''Saaphryi''': Got disqualified for assaulting H-Town over a bed.\n\n===Flav is Blind===\n''First aired August 13, 2006''\n\nFlav challenges the remaining fourteen Flavorettes to a blind speed dating competition so he could get to know them without appearance being a factor. Things fell apart when Flav realized he couldn't eat something he couldn't see. The girls were each given ten minutes to leave a lasting impression on Flav as he stumbled from table to table. In the end, Flav chose Tiger, Like Dat, and Buckwild as the winners while indulging in a bucket of [[KFC]].\n\nIn the morning, Buckeey commented on Like Dat's slovenly table manners. Later in the day, the three girls who won the speed dating competition accompanied Flav on a group date to the \"gonzoleers\" ([[gondolas]]) in the [[Long Beach, California|LBC]]. Flavor Flav tried to stick to the tradition of kissing all the girls as they passed under the bridges, however Tiger had no interest in kissing him. She claimed that she didn't like kissing him after other girls. Later that evening, Flav had a mixer, and all went well until Wire watched Buckeey and Flavor Flav kiss. She stood there until Flav asked her to go inside. She then played the piano very loudly and ruined Buckeey's date. Toasteee gave Flavor Flav advice on whom he should eliminate, and he took this into consideration that night in the elimination ceremony. Wire and Spunkeey were both eliminated. Spunkeey cried hard when she was eliminated and was sad that he kept \"the beauty queen over her\" and the \"girls who want to have sex with other girls\". She also said \"I would have shited on your floor if I had to\" as she hugged Flav goodbye.\n*'''Challenge:''' Blind speed dating competition.\n*'''Challenge Winners:''' Tiger, Like Dat, Buckwild\n*'''Bottom Three:''' Somethin, Wire, Spunkeey\n* '''Eliminated:''' Wire, Spunkeey\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Spunkeey''': Acted too fake around him.\n*'''Wire''': Flav claims he wasn't feeling her.\n\n===She Works Hard for Her Honey===\n''First aired August 20, 2006''\n\nFlav divides the girls into two groups. Buckwild, Krazy, Toasteee, Somethin, Bootz, and Deelishis have to work at one of Flav's favorite restaurants. Sumthin gets fired for not taking it seriously, and Bootz wins the challenge. The next day, the second group has to clean a disgusting house after a crazy party the night before. The group consists of Buckeey, Tiger, Payshintz, Nibblz, Beatuful and Like Dat. They find out they are cleaning hip-hop legend [[Warren G]]'s house. While half of the girls are cleaning, back at the mansion Buckwild, Krazy and Deelishis watch as Bootz and Somethin are arguing. The winner is Nibblz, and she and Flav have a king and queen dinner. Bootz and Payshintz then start fighting. Many of the other girls joined in and started making racial comments, furthermore accusing her of not knowing who she or Flav is. Bootz tells Flav that Tiger, Somethin, and Payshintz should all go home. Flav takes this into consideration, and eliminates Tiger and Sumthin. He has a clock for Payshintz as well, but she chooses not to accept it because she couldn't take the drama with Bootz, and a few of the other girls anymore.\n*'''Challenge:''' To work at one of Flav's favorite restaurants (six girls).

In the morning, Flav holds a hip-hop dance contest. The girls are divided into three teams of three each. Krazy, Nibblz, and Deelishis end up winning. Each girl gets a private date with Flav; that night, Krazy goes with him on a romantic candlelit dinner to KFC, Nibblz spends the next morning in his bedroom and has breakfast with him, and Deelishis goes with him to a strawberry field.\n\nIn the meantime, Toasteee tells the other girls that the night before, she heard noises and concluded that Nibblz was giving Flav a [[handjob]]. Nibblz retaliates by revealing to Flav that Toasteee apparently admitted that she has done pornography on the internet and in a magazine. Toasteee denies the allegations, so Flav does some internet research to see who's lying. Toasteee goes to Flav, letting him know that she's leaving because she can't handle the drama anymore. Flav tells Toasteee that if she leaves now, she's basically implying that Nibblz was right. Toasteee agrees to stay. In that evening's eliminations, Flav has both girls promise they're telling the truth. But right after that, Flav holds up a pornographic picture of Toasteee. Everyone is shocked by the evidence. Toasteee claims that it's not necessarily evidence against her as she leaves.\n\n*'''Challenge:''' A hip-hop dance contest divided by three teams.\n*'''Challenge Winners:''' Krazy, Nibblz, Deelishis\n*'''Bottom two:''' Nibblz, Toasteee\n* '''Eliminated:''' Toastee\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Toasteee''': Lied to Flav about doing porn.\n\n===Famous Friends and Strangeness===\n''First aired September 3, 2006''\n\nThis episode starts with the girls finding out that they must throw a party for some of Flav's famous friends. Like Dat confronts Buckwild about her speech patterns, claiming that she is talking like she's black and that it isn't how she really talks, but Buckwild says that she's not a fake. Bootz, Like Dat, and Buckwild get into a fight about Buckeey and Deelishis not working hard. After all the fights, the girls are excited to find out who will be coming to the party. The special guests are [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Warren G]], [[Don Magic Juan]], [[DJ Quik]], [[Ying Yang Twins|the Ying Yang Twins]], and [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Young Buck]] of [[G-Unit]]. When the guests first arrive Bootz entertain them with her booty dancing, and Nibblz gives them [[lap dances]]. The Ying Yang Twins ask Bootz to dance in one of their videos and she declines because she didn't want to risk her relationship with Flav. During the party, Nibblz drinks too much [[liquor]] and is in the bathroom [[vomiting]], resulting in Like Dat having to lay her down on her bed. Also, Three 6 Mafia asks Krazy to sing any of Flav's songs. She says she knows one of them, but she can't sing it. Bootz and Krazy have an argument about Krazy being real or not. Like Dat and Buckwild then get into the same argument again. Buckwild says that when she is around different races of people, her voice changes. She then wants to leave but Like Dat convinces her to stay. Flav spends time with Buckeey, Bootz, and Like Dat before elimination. However, Like Dat is sent home because Flav only sees her as a friend. The girls are then pissed to find out that another guest will be joining them tomorrow: Season 1's Tiffany \"New York\" Pollard.\n* '''Challenge:''' To throw a party and interact with some of Flav's friends.\n* '''Challenge winner:''' None\n* '''Eliminated:''' Like Dat\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Like Dat''': Only saw her as a friend.\n\n===Photo Shoot To The Death===\n''First aired September 10, 2006''\n\nThe episode begins the night, that Flav welcomes Season 1's [[Tiffany Pollard]] aka New York back to the house as a guest to help him decide about tomorrow night's eliminations for the seven remaining ladies. All the girls are pissed that New York returned to the house, because they hold New York in contempt. Flav leaves the girls alone and New York asks the girls about each other and Bootz lets New York know that she doesn't like her and doesn't want her there and that she's just another bitch trying to steal her man. New York and Bootz get into an argument, where New York calls Bootz a \"dreamer\" meaning she's just dreaming of Flav being her man. The next day, the girls wake up and are told to go to a photoshoot for URB Magazine. New York is in charge of how the women look. New York is yelling at everybody because they were late and screams to them to come down stairs. New York gets into an argument with Bootz when Bootz is late coming downstairs for the evaluation. New York has mean things to say to all of them (except Deelishis and Beautful).\n\nThe girls head to the photoshoot and New York is once again giving the girls nasty comments. After the photoshoot, Buckwild and New York get into a fight over Buckwild being \"darker than what she is\". Flav steps in and takes Buckwild's side. New York runs out crying and feels disrespected by Flav. Meanwhile, the girls are upset that New York is there and Krazy decides to call her out. The two fight because Krazy is saying that New York is not in control of elimination and New York went on top of the table and touched her on the head which lead Flav to come and stop it.\n\nFlav then takes New York and asks her about each of the girls. She wonders if Buckwild is actually there to be in a romantic relationship with Flav. She feels that Buckeey lacks energy. Nibblz is filthy and too sexual. New York believes that both Bootz and Deelishis are there to be with him, while she believes that Krazy is there for the wrong reasons.\n\nBack at the house, Krazy calls Deelishis out when Deelishis spreads the word that Krazy is fake to all of the girls back at the photoshoot.\n\nAt eliminations, New York states that Krazy, Beatuful and Nibblz should go home. Flav eliminates Beatuful because she is too laid back and Nibblz because she wouldn't fit with his children. Krazy gets her clock. Flav has a surprise and invites New York back as a full-time competitor. The girls are pissed and Buckwild returns her clock because New York returned and she was afraid she would violate her probation with New York there. Her urban style of speech that had been a point of contention earlier in the season disappeared during the elimination ceremony, making Flav and the other contestants certain that she had been faking it all along. \n* '''Brought back:''' [[Tiffany Pollard|Tiffany 'New York' Pollard]]\n* '''Challenge:''' A photo shoot for Urb Magazine.\n* '''Challenge winner:''' None\n* '''Bottom Three:''' Krazy, Beatuful, Nibblz\n* '''Eliminated:''' Beatuful, Nibblz\n* '''Quit:''' Buckwild\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Beatuful''': Flav said she was too laid back and not aggressive.\n*'''Nibblz''': Flav said she wasn't a good example for his kids and said that his kids won't be comfortable with their father being with a stripper.\n*'''Buckwild''': Quit the competition because she didn't want to have to deal with New York being there.\n\n===Boxin' Each Other Out===\n''First aired September 17, 2006''\n\nFive girls remaining: [[Tiffany Pollard|New York]], Krazy, Bootz, Buckeey, and Deelishis. Flav instructs them to put pictures of the two girls they think most deserve elimination into a box. They choose Krazy and New York, and as a result, neither of them get dates that evening. They pick Krazy because they think she is fake. New York is picked because she came on the show later than the others, and they felt that she wouldn't be a good mom for Flav's children. Flav takes Buckeey on a date to a bowling alley and teaches her how to bowl. For his second date, Flav has a romantic evening with Bootz in the backyard. But Bootz tells Flav that she is going to wait until she gets married to have sex. Flav is shocked and upset by this. The next day, Deelishis is getting ready for her date when New York comes in and argues with her for saying that New York is fake.\n\nBig Rick must come in to break up the fight. When New York leaves, she says that she just ruined Deelishis' date. However, Deelishis and Flav have a great time on an exotic camel ride date. Buckeey and Krazy then get into a dangerous fight when she hears Krazy talking bad about her, Bootz, and Deelishis to New York. Krazy supposedly pushes Buckeey, to which Buckeey responds by almost pushing Krazy off of the second-floor outside balcony. New York laughs and tries to break them apart. At the elimination ceremony, Buckeey is eliminated for almost killing Krazy. New York then states her plan, which is that Deelishis and Bootz will be her next \"victims\". She also says that Krazy thinks that they are friends, but New York is just using her to eliminate the other girls.\n* '''Challenge:''' To put pictures of the two girls they think most deserve elimination into a box.\n* '''Challenge winners:''' Buckeey, Bootz, Deelishis\n* '''Bottom two:''' Buckeey, Krazy\n* '''Eliminated:''' Buckeey\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Buckeey''': For assaulting Krazy by almost pushing her off the balcony.\n\n===Steppin' Out Flav Style===\n''First aired September 24, 2006''\n\nWith the four remaining women, the episode begins with Bootz and Deelishis still in their beds discussing their disdain for [[Tiffany Pollard|New York]] and Krazy. Then all the girls go downstairs where Rick delivers the Flav-O-Gram which New York reads. Flav pairs Deelishis and Krazy for the first date to LBC. As usual New York becomes openly upset and goes upstairs. After she leaves Deelishis snidely says that New York is a \"loony\" and begins to read the Flav-O-Gram aloud again and discovers that New York said slicking where the Flav-O-Gram said slicing. Soon afterward Deelishis follows New York to the balcony where she is standing visibly upset that she hasn't had a date with Flav in four days. The conversation is short but almost escalates into a confrontation after Deelishis tells New York to redirect her hostility. After the discussion Krazy and Deelishis set off for their date with Flav. When they get there Flav greets them and the two climb aboard the yacht. Flav eventually makes out with Deelishis, which upsets Krazy. But soon Deelishis leaves Flav's side, seasick. Krazy and Flav speak intimately. After they get off the yacht Flav takes the girls to the [[RMS Queen Mary]] for accommodations where the girls prepare for dinner. During dinner Flav asks Krazy how she feels about him and what she feels they share in common. When she fails to answer appropriately, he asks her to sing. She says she would love a record deal, but doesn't have the money. Afterward he asks Deelishis how she feels about him. Deelishis declares her feelings for him, through tears. Flav decides to spend the night with Deelishis. Flav turns and bids farewell to Krazy but mistakenly calls her Deelishis. Deelishis and Flav retire to their room where eventually they fall asleep together.\n\nThe next day New York and Bootz meet Flav at a [[winery]] where a woman brings them three horses. Bootz gets on her horse up immediately but New York is hesitant and panics. Eventually all three of them go for a ride through the winery fields. They stop at a beautiful spread where they sip wine and Flav tells Bootz he is really feeling her. Naturally New York is angry. Tensions rise but soon all three wind up stomping grapes together. After they shower they leave the winery and go to the [[Pechanga Resort and Casino]] where Bootz and New York prepare for dinner. During the date all Flav's attention goes to Bootz. New York feels ignored and demands attention, then storms off. Flav gives chase and asks her to spend the night with him, which New York later reveals was her plan. Bootz and New York then argue over dinner. After dinner they leave for their room and New York reveals that she again had sex with Flav.\n\nAfter the two dates they are all faced yet again with the elimination ceremony. The first clock goes to New York, the second goes to Deelishis and the third goes to Krazy, despite Flav's worries about her intentions, he feels that they have a strong connection. Flav then eliminates Bootz because she said she wouldn't have sex with him until she is married. But before she leaves, she gives him her phone number for him to call her when \"he gets sick of those ho's\".\n* '''Bottom two:''' Krazy, Bootz\n* '''Eliminated:''' Bootz\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Bootz''': Flav felt that he couldn't be with someone who was waiting until marriage to have sex with and that her connection wasn't as strong as the connection that he had with Krazy\n\n===Family Flavors===\n''First aired October 1, 2006'' (3.99M viewers)<ref>{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Nielsen Ratings for Cable Networks |date=6 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nFlav decides to have the three remaining girls' parents come over so he can get to know them. Hours before the remaining girls' parents arrive, everyone is cleaning and preparing rooms for the parents. Suddenly New York is bothering Deelishis because she believed that Deelishis intentionally took the room that New York chose her parents to stay in. Deelishis, unknowing of what New York is so upset about, has a brief confrontation with New York over who gets the room. Then Deelishis' parents arrive. Flav immediately likes Deelishis's parents. New York's parents arrive and as was shown from Season 1, New York's mother doesn't like Flav. This leads to a confrontation early on, and we discover that New York's mother will do anything to keep her daughter from being together with Flav, even fake a terminal illness. Flav then invites his six children and two grandchildren to the house to get their input on who would make a better stepmother. Later, he takes the women and their mothers over on separate dates: Deelishis and her parents go to a magic show and dinner; Krazy, her mother, and her grandmother go to the hair salon; and Flav orders an assortment of soul food for New York and her parents. That night during elimination, Flav eliminates Krazy because he suspects she is only on the show to further her singing career. At the end, he announces that Deelishis and New York will be going to [[Placencia]], [[Belize]] the next day. The show ends with New York's mother yelling, insisting that New York is coming home right now. New York, however, does not leave the mansion.\n* '''Eliminated:''' Krazy\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''Krazy''': Flav felt that she was only on the show to promote her singing career.\n\n===Oh No She Didn't!===\n''First aired October 8, 2006'' (2.7M viewers)<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |title=Viewer numbers down the hatch |first=Gary |last=Levin |department=Life |page=D.4 |date=11 October 2006 |access-date=26 September 2010 |url=http://usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-10-10-nielsen-analysis_x.htm}}</ref>\n\nThis episode shows highlights of the second season with unseen footage. The pivotal quote of perhaps the entire series took place during the unseen footage aired on this episode. New York's mother, Michelle, told Deelishis that her [[Buttocks|posterior]] was so large that she was capable of moving her bowels for an entire year. Deelishis had no comment. There was a scene where Flav was in a photo shoot with some girls from Flavor of Love Season 1. He said, \"I'd throw all of y'alls in my crib, except Hottie.\"\n\n===Flav Belize In Love===\n''First aired October 15, 2006''\n\nThe episode begins where Episode 9 ended, when Flav announced the two remaining girls were going to Placencia, Belize. New York's mother knocks on Flav's door and informs him that she is going to get her daughter out of the mansion, but gets nothing more than a rise from Flav and New York. New York's mother then ends up leaving, but not before she tells Flav that he can't marry her daughter (to which Flav responds that if he asked New York, she would marry him).\n\nThe next day it's New York's turn, and she and Flav go on a small cruise liner. There is a misunderstanding between the two when New York makes remarks that suggest that she wants to take control of his life and money; Flav thinks New York is sounding like her mother. However, later New York apologizes for what she said, and decides to accept Flav's decision-making power. That night, Flav invites her to his hotel room for a nightcap. At first she declines, but later decides that she can't put up with the hurt going on inside, and eventually accepts.\n\nThe following night, amid a rainstorm, the two girls are invited to the dock where Flav makes his final decision. Flav talks about his feelings for the two girls, both what he likes and what he dislikes. In the end, Flav decides that Deelishis is the winner. New York, angry that she lost again, starts a vulgarity-laced outburst towards Flav, resulting in the two trading insults. After [[mooning]] Flav, she says that she no longer has feelings for him and will someday find \"another man who is right for me\". While storming off and sobbing uncontrollably, she says to the camera, \"Do I look like I give a fuck cause I don't\". She also says she wishes that one day she will find the man of her dreams. Flav gives Deelishis a shiny gold grill to match his, and he says he can't wait to meet Deelishis' daughter Jasmine (as he has a daughter with the same name).\n* '''Winner:''' Deelishis\n* '''Runner up:''' New York\n\n;Reasons For Elimination\n\n*'''New York''': Flav already had a strong connection with New York and said everything was going good until they were in Belize, spending time together on the boat and said that New York sounded \"like her mother\" and New York has jealous ways.\n\n===Reunion: After the Lovin'===\n''First aired October 29, 2006''\n\nThe twenty-one women from the second season reunite on stage. [[La La (entertainer)|La La]] hosts once again. She introduces all the girls (with the exception of Deelishis and New York, who arrive later, and Eye'z and Payshintz, who did not show up). After this introduction, La La asks Saaphyri and H-Town to come up on stage and discuss the fight they had, after showing the tape of it. Saaphyri says H-Town threw flowers at her, meaning she couldn't do anything about it. Saaphyri later admits to having gone to anger management classes, in consideration of Flav saying she was too violent. She later says she got a certificate, which amuses everyone. Later, Goldie from the first season makes an appearance. She asks Krazy why she thought New York was her friend and says that Somethin is strong for dealing with what happened with her on the show. She also asks Bootz, Buckwild, and Like Dat to do their booty dancing again from the fourth episode. After entertaining the crowd, La La, and the girls, Flavor Flav appears. La La asks Krazy to come up on stage, and she asks if Krazy thought being on the show helped or hurt her career. She says \"it helped us all in our own way.\" Next, Krazy sings for Flav and appears to have mostly negative receptions.\n\nThen Flav asks Deelishis to come out. They state that they have been apart for four months so that no one would know the outcome of the show. La La asks what Nibblz thought of his decision. She says Deelishis was a great choice for him and she has a \"fabulous ass\". Deelishis' daughter Jasmine meets Flav for the first time, but this moment doesn't make it onto the final edit of the show.\n\nAfter a few minutes, New York is brought out. Buckwild throws a shoe at New York, which narrowly misses New York's head. La La tells Buckwild to respect her, since she never disrespected anyone and that the shoe almost hit her. Then Saaphyri throws a red bull can at New York. New York, Buckwild, Buckeey, and Saaphyri can be heard confronting each other at a distance. After this warning, La La asks Bootz whether she still wanted to say anything to New York. Bootz and New York then exchange insults, and Bootz tells New York, 'Flav only brought you back to fuck you, 'cause he left your ass twice!\" Bootz then runs backstage. But security grabs Bootz, then New York tries to punch Bootz in the face and is screaming \"come on bitch, come on bitch bring that shit\" veral of the contestants attempt to intervene, and in the end Buckwild, Saaphyri, Buckeey, Bootz, and Deelishis were asked to leave. Deelishis and Saaphyri were later brought back before the reunion concluded.  It was later revealed that New York would be featured on her own show, ''[[I Love New York (TV series)|I Love New York]]'', which premiered in January 2007.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Flavor of Love contestants]]\n\n==After the show==\n* Deelishis ([[Chandra Davis]]) revealed in a special \"Where Are They Now\" that she and Flav were no longer dating.
