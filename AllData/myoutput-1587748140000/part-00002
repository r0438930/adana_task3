The \"P for Pursuit\" designation was derived from the French ''Chasseur'' designation (literally, hunter) for [[fighter aircraft|fighters]].|group=N}} was the first American all-metal production [[fighter aircraft]] and the first pursuit [[monoplane]] to enter squadron service with the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. Designed and built by [[Boeing]], the prototype first flew in 1932, and the type was still in use with the U.S. Army Air Corps as late as 1941 in the [[Philippines]].  There are only two surviving Peashooters, but there are three reproductions on exhibit with two more under construction.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe project, funded by Boeing, to produce the Boeing Model 248 began in September 1931, with the US Army Air Corps supplying the engines and the instruments. The design, which included an open cockpit, fixed landing gear and externally braced wings, was the last such design procured by the USAAC as a fighter aircraft. The Model 248 had a high landing speed, which caused a number of accidents. To remedy this, [[Flap (aircraft)|flap]]s were fitted to reduce the landing speed. The Army Air Corps ordered three prototypes, designated ''XP-936'', with the first flight on 20 March 1932.\n\nThe Boeing XP-936 was still tricky to land and could roll onto its back while landing, injuring the pilot. The prototype's headrest offered little protection in such instances. As a result, production Model 266s (''P-26A''s) had a taller headrest installed to provide some protection.\n\nTwo [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s were completed as ''P-26B''s with [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340|Pratt & Whitney R-1340-33]] engines. These were followed by twenty-three ''P-26C''s, with [[Carburetor|carburated]] R-1340-33s and modified fuel systems. Both the [[Spanish Air Force]] (one aircraft) and the [[Republic of China Air Force]] (eleven aircraft) ordered examples of the Boeing ''Model 281'', an export version of the P-26 comparable to the P-26C, in 1936.\n\nThe diminutive \"Peashooter\", as it was known by service pilots, was faster than previous American combat aircraft. Nonetheless, rapid progress in aviation led to it quickly becoming an anachronism, with [[Flying wires|wire-braced]] wings, fixed landing gear and an open cockpit. The stressed-skin [[cantilever]]-wing [[Dewoitine D.500]] flew the same year as the P-26 and two years afterwards the Soviet [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]] was flying with retractable landing gear. By 1935, just three years after the P-26, the [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]], [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] were all flying with enclosed cockpits, retractable landing gear and cantilever wings. However, the P-26 remained in service until after the United States entered [[World War II]] in December 1941.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===U.S. Army Air Corps===\n[[File:Boeing P-26 in flight, 9 aircraft formation 060907-F-1234P-004.jpg|thumb|Formation of nine Boeing P-26s of the 20th Pursuit Group]]\n\nDeliveries to USAAC pursuit squadrons began in December 1933 with the last production P-26C aircraft coming off the assembly line in 1936. Ultimately, 22 squadrons flew the Peashooter, with peak service being six squadrons, in 1936. P-26s were the frontline fighters of the USAAC until 1938, when [[Seversky P-35]]s and [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]]s began to replace the P-26. A total of twenty P-26s were lost in accidents between 1934 and America's entry into World War II on 7 December 1941, but only five before 1940.\n\nAir Corps units using the P-26<ref>Maloney and Ryan 1965, Squadron Assignments</ref> were the:\n*[[1st Operations Group|1st Pursuit Group]] ([[17th Fighter Squadron|17th]], [[27th Fighter Squadron|27th]], and [[94th Fighter Squadron|94th PS]]), [[Selfridge Field]], Michigan;\n* [[4th Composite Group]] ([[3d Fighter Training Squadron|3d]], 17th, and [[20th Fighter Squadron|20th PS]]), [[Nichols Field|Nichols]] and [[Clark Field|Clark field]]s, [[Philippine Department]].\n*[[8th Operations Group|8th Pursuit Group]] (33rd, [[35th Fighter Squadron|35th]], and [[36th Fighter Squadron|36th PS]]), [[Langley Field]], Virginia;\n*[[16th Pursuit Group]] ([[24th Fighter Squadron|24th]] and [[78th Reconnaissance Squadron|78th PS]]), [[Albrook Field]], Panama Canal Zone;\n[[File:P-26 Maloney.jpg|thumb|Boeing P-26A Peashooter of the 34th Pursuit Squadron 17th Pursuit Group]]\n*[[17th Pursuit Group]] ([[34th Bomb Squadron|34th]], 73d, and 95th PS), [[March Field]], California\n*[[18th Operations Group|18th Pursuit Group]] ([[6th Night Fighter Squadron|6th]] and [[19th Fighter Squadron|19th PS]]), [[Wheeler Field]], Hawaii; and\n*[[20th Pursuit Group]] ([[55th Fighter Squadron|55th]], [[77th Fighter Squadron|77th]], and [[79th Fighter Squadron|79th PS]]), [[Barksdale Field]], Louisiana.\n\n====Overseas deployments====\nBetween 1938 and 1940, P-26s were assigned overseas to supplement Seversky P-35s in two defense units based at [[Wheeler Field]], Territory of [[Hawaii]]:\n*18th Pursuit Group (6th, 19th, 73d, and 78th PS)\n*[[15th Pursuit Group]] (45th and [[47th Fighter Squadron|47th PS]]).\n\nThe 17th PG became the [[17th Attack Group]] in 1935, and its P-26s were transferred in 1938 to the [[16th Pursuit Group]] (24th, 29th, and 78th PS) at [[Albrook Field]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. These P-26s were transferred in 1940 to the [[37th Pursuit Group]] (28th, 30th, and 31st PS) which flew them until they were replaced by P-40s in May 1941. Some continued service with the [[32d Pursuit Group]] (51st and 53rd PS), but only nine P-26s remained operational in Central America at the start of World War II.\n\nP-26As were also flown by the 3d&nbsp;PS of the [[4th Composite Group]], based in the Philippines. Between 1937 and 1941, 31 were sold to the fledgling [[Philippine Army Air Corps]].\n\n===Combat service===\nThe first Boeing P-26 to experience major combat operation was the Chinese Model 281. On 15 August 1937, eight P-26/281s from the [[Chinese Nationalist Air Force]] 3rd Pursuit Group, 17th Squadron, based at Chuyung airfield, engaged eight out of twenty [[Mitsubishi G3M]] ''Nell'' [[medium bomber]]s from the Kisarazu Air Group sent to attack Nanking. The Chinese Boeing fighters helped shoot down two of the four Japanese bombers destroyed that day without suffering any losses. Subsequent engagements between the Chinese Peashooter pilots and pilots of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] flying the [[Mitsubishi A5M]] ([[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] \"Claude\") were the first aerial dogfights and kills between all-metal monoplane fighter aircraft.<ref>Gustavsson, H\u00e5kan.

The \"P for Pursuit\" designation was derived from the French ''Chasseur'' designation (literally, hunter) for [[fighter aircraft|fighters]].|group=N}} was the first American all-metal production [[fighter aircraft]] and the first pursuit [[monoplane]] to enter squadron service with the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. Designed and built by [[Boeing]], the prototype first flew in 1932, and the type was still in use with the U.S. Army Air Corps as late as 1941 in the [[Philippines]].  There are only two surviving Peashooters, but there are three reproductions on exhibit with two more under construction.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe project, funded by Boeing, to produce the Boeing Model 248 began in September 1931, with the US Army Air Corps supplying the engines and the instruments. The design, which included an open cockpit, fixed landing gear and externally braced wings, was the last such design procured by the USAAC as a fighter aircraft. The Model 248 had a high landing speed, which caused a number of accidents. To remedy this, [[Flap (aircraft)|flap]]s were fitted to reduce the landing speed. The Army Air Corps ordered three prototypes, designated ''XP-936'', with the first flight on 20 March 1932.\n\nThe Boeing XP-936 was still tricky to land and could roll onto its back while landing, injuring the pilot. The prototype's headrest offered little protection in such instances. As a result, production Model 266s (''P-26A''s) had a taller headrest installed to provide some protection.\n\nTwo [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s were completed as ''P-26B''s with [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340|Pratt & Whitney R-1340-33]] engines. These were followed by twenty-three ''P-26C''s, with [[Carburetor|carburated]] R-1340-33s and modified fuel systems. Both the [[Spanish Air Force]] (one aircraft) and the [[Republic of China Air Force]] (eleven aircraft) ordered examples of the Boeing ''Model 281'', an export version of the P-26 comparable to the P-26C, in 1936.\n\nThe diminutive \"Peashooter\", as it was known by service pilots, was faster than previous American combat aircraft. Nonetheless, rapid progress in aviation led to it quickly becoming an anachronism, with [[Flying wires|wire-braced]] wings, fixed landing gear and an open cockpit. The stressed-skin [[cantilever]]-wing [[Dewoitine D.500]] flew the same year as the P-26 and two years afterwards the Soviet [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]] was flying with retractable landing gear. By 1935, just three years after the P-26, the [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]], [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] were all flying with enclosed cockpits, retractable landing gear and cantilever wings. However, the P-26 remained in service until after the United States entered [[World War II]] in December 1941.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===U.S. Army Air Corps===\n[[File:Boeing P-26 in flight, 9 aircraft formation 060907-F-1234P-004.jpg|thumb|Formation of nine Boeing P-26s of the 20th Pursuit Group]]\n\nDeliveries to USAAC pursuit squadrons began in December 1933 with the last production P-26C aircraft coming off the assembly line in 1936. Ultimately, 22 squadrons flew the Peashooter, with peak service being six squadrons, in 1936. P-26s were the frontline fighters of the USAAC until 1938, when [[Seversky P-35]]s and [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]]s began to replace the P-26. A total of twenty P-26s were lost in accidents between 1934 and America's entry into World War II on 7 December 1941, but only five before 1940.\n\nAir Corps units using the P-26<ref>Maloney and Ryan 1965, Squadron Assignments</ref> were the:\n*[[1st Operations Group|1st Pursuit Group]] ([[17th Fighter Squadron|17th]], [[27th Fighter Squadron|27th]], and [[94th Fighter Squadron|94th PS]]), [[Selfridge Field]], Michigan;\n* [[4th Composite Group]] ([[3d Fighter Training Squadron|3d]], 17th, and [[20th Fighter Squadron|20th PS]]), [[Nichols Field|Nichols]] and [[Clark Field|Clark field]]s, [[Philippine Department]].\n*[[8th Operations Group|8th Pursuit Group]] (33rd, [[35th Fighter Squadron|35th]], and [[36th Fighter Squadron|36th PS]]), [[Langley Field]], Virginia;\n*[[16th Pursuit Group]] ([[24th Fighter Squadron|24th]] and [[78th Reconnaissance Squadron|78th PS]]), [[Albrook Field]], Panama Canal Zone;\n[[File:P-26 Maloney.jpg|thumb|Boeing P-26A Peashooter of the 34th Pursuit Squadron 17th Pursuit Group]]\n*[[17th Pursuit Group]] ([[34th Bomb Squadron|34th]], 73d, and 95th PS), [[March Field]], California\n*[[18th Operations Group|18th Pursuit Group]] ([[6th Night Fighter Squadron|6th]] and [[19th Fighter Squadron|19th PS]]), [[Wheeler Field]], Hawaii; and\n*[[20th Pursuit Group]] ([[55th Fighter Squadron|55th]], [[77th Fighter Squadron|77th]], and [[79th Fighter Squadron|79th PS]]), [[Barksdale Field]], Louisiana.\n\n====Overseas deployments====\nBetween 1938 and 1940, P-26s were assigned overseas to supplement Seversky P-35s in two defense units based at [[Wheeler Field]], Territory of [[Hawaii]]:\n*18th Pursuit Group (6th, 19th, 73d, and 78th PS)\n*[[15th Pursuit Group]] (45th and [[47th Fighter Squadron|47th PS]]).\n\nThe 17th PG became the [[17th Attack Group]] in 1935, and its P-26s were transferred in 1938 to the [[16th Pursuit Group]] (24th, 29th, and 78th PS) at [[Albrook Field]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. These P-26s were transferred in 1940 to the [[37th Pursuit Group]] (28th, 30th, and 31st PS) which flew them until they were replaced by P-40s in May 1941. Some continued service with the [[32d Pursuit Group]] (51st and 53rd PS), but only nine P-26s remained operational in Central America at the start of World War II.\n\nP-26As were also flown by the 3d&nbsp;PS of the [[4th Composite Group]], based in the Philippines. Between 1937 and 1941, 31 were sold to the fledgling [[Philippine Army Air Corps]].\n\n===Combat service===\nThe first Boeing P-26 to experience major combat operation was the Chinese Model 281. On 15 August 1937, eight P-26/281s from the [[Chinese Nationalist Air Force]] 3rd Pursuit Group, 17th Squadron, based at Chuyung airfield, engaged eight out of twenty [[Mitsubishi G3M]] ''Nell'' [[medium bomber]]s from the Kisarazu Air Group sent to attack Nanking. The Chinese Boeing fighters helped shoot down two of the four Japanese bombers destroyed that day without suffering any losses. Subsequent engagements between the Chinese Peashooter pilots and pilots of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] flying the [[Mitsubishi A5M]] ([[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] \"Claude\") were the first aerial dogfights and kills between all-metal monoplane fighter aircraft.<ref>Gustavsson, H\u00e5kan.
