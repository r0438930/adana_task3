'''Pamela Austin''' (born '''Pamela Joan Akert''', December 20, 1941) is an American actress.

==Early life==
Austin was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. She spent part of her childhood in Europe, as her father served a tour of duty with the Air Force there. Austin studied dancing at [[California State University, Sacramento|Sacramento State College]], and found work with the Tony Martin nightclub act upon arriving in Hollywood.<ref name=\"glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/521/Pamela+Austin/index.html|title=Pamela Austin profile|publisher=glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com|accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
Natalia aka BEANBEAR loves her brother Diego so much and this is Wikipedia so it must be true right TALIA??? <3


In addition to appearing in two [[Elvis Presley]] films, in 1965-1967 Austin gained fame for a long series of popular automobile television commercials (and print ads) for [[Dodge]] (the [[Dodge Charger|Charger]], [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]], [[Dodge Polara|Polara]], and other models). As the perky \"Dodge Rebellion Girl\", she appeared in around twenty commercials as a [[damsel in distress]] — menaced by sharks, falling from a draw-bridge, a roof, a cargo plane, etc. Her tag line at the end of each ad was \"The Dodge Rebellion wants you!\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The ad series led to numerous film and television offers and a three-page profile in ''[[TV Guide]]'' (August 20–26, 1966). By 1968, Dodge executives felt Austin's popularity was overshadowing the cars and began a new \"Dodge Fever\" campaign with a different model, Joan Anita Parker.

In August 1967 she starred in the adventure-comedy film ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1967 film)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' based on the silent [[cliff-hanger]] [[Serial film|serial]]. Posters for the film referenced her Dodge commercials: ''That \"Rebellion Girl\" is dodgin' unbelievable perils...''<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/person/2899/Pamela-Austin/filmography Filmography], nytimes.com; accessed January 6, 2017.</ref>

In 1968 she was a semi-regular on the hit comedy series ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' during its first season. Austin performed in various comedy sketches, song-and-dance numbers, and pre-filmed segments, including an early music video for \"Buy For Me The Rain\" by [[The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]].<ref>{{IMDb name|0042487}}</ref>

A writer for ''RapReviews'' gave praise to the production quality throughout the track listing, singling out Cool & Dre for their contributions that showcase their talents, and Joe for delivering on his lyrical content with hard-edged, introspective street bangers and romantic rap ballads despite getting a \"little too commercial for his own good\" in the middle portion of the album, concluding that \"When all things are considered, Fat Joe did a nice job of balancing this album for different crowds and fanbases, if not a great job of doing so like he did on ''[[Don Cartagena]]'' and ''[[J.O.S.E.]]''.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> ''[[HipHopDX]]'' staff writer Mikeo said, \"Fat Joe's ''Loyalty'' isn't anything more than average in the end. The hodge-podge of grimy, ghetto inspired tracks and commercially acceptable songs leave this album in staccato. Overall, as a product it's easy to recommend to the radio hungry Hip Hop fan, it's just that [Fat] Joe is not going to be remembered for the time he put into this release.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/>

'''''E Pluribus Funk''''' is the fifth studio album by American rock band [[Grand Funk Railroad]]. The album was released in November 1971, by [[Capitol Records]]. Like previous Grand Funk Railroad albums, it was recorded at [[Cleveland Recording Company]] and is the final album produced by [[Terry Knight]]. The title is a play on the motto of the United States of America, [[E pluribus unum]]. The original release cover (designed by [[Ernie Cefalu]]) was completely round and covered with a silver-like film to resemble a large coin. The back  side of the cover of this album included a die cast picture of [[Shea Stadium]] to celebrate Grand Funk beating [[The Beatles]]' Shea Stadium attendance record by selling out in just 72 hours.

'''Saltdean''' is a coastal village in the city of [[Brighton and Hove]], with part (known as '''East Saltdean''') outside the city boundary in [[Lewes (district)|Lewes]] district. Saltdean is approximately 5 miles east of central [[Brighton]], 5 miles west of [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], and 6 miles south of [[Lewes]]. It is bordered by farmland and the South Downs National Park.

==History==
[[File:Longridge Avenue Shops - geograph.org.uk - 634584.jpg|thumb|Shops on Longridge Avenue]]
Saltdean was open farmland, originally a part of the village of [[Rottingdean]], and almost uninhabited until 1924 when land was sold off for speculative housing and property development. Some of this was promoted by entrepreneur [[Charles W. Neville]], who had set up a company to develop the site (he also eventually built nearby towns [[Peacehaven]] and parts of Rottingdean).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saltdean.info/begsaltdean.htm|title=Beginning of Saltdean Today|access-date=12 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102171400/http://www.saltdean.info/begsaltdean.htm|archive-date=2 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Saltdean has a mainly shingle beach, fronted by a promenade, the Undercliff Walk, which can be reached directly from the cliff top, by steps from the coast road, or by a subway tunnel from the nearby Lido. The buildings nearest the beach  are the most architecturally varied, and include some influenced by international trends of the inter-war years, e.g. [[Bauhaus]] and [[Cubism]], and there are some which are Spanish influenced.

The most famous building is the [[Saltdean Lido]] community centre, which includes a public library and iconic open air swimming-pool, designed by architect [[R.W.H. Jones]]. He also designed other buildings in the area, including the former Grand Ocean Hotel, built using [[Art Deco]] 'ocean liner' architecture.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Saltdean story|author=Douglas D'Enno|publisher=Phillimore|year=1985|ISBN=0-85033-573-6}}</ref>

Saltdean is now a prosperous village suburb of the city of Brighton and Hove, whilst its eastern side is administratively part of the neighbouring Lewes District Council.

==Geography==
Saltdean is situated by the sea in a 'Dean' (Saxon/Old English for 'dry valley'), with the surrounding hills of the South Downs National Park forming a large central dip and valley where the oval shaped Saltdean Park and Lido are located, looking out over the adjacent sea.

Tree lined roads and avenues radiate out in wide oval curves from the park in order to follow the contours of the local topography. The plan of the village was designed from inception to vary considerably from neighbouring Peacehaven's more grid-like system.

==Education==
Saltdean Primary School is the only school in Saltdean, it is well subscribed and very highly regarded. There is also a library located in the Lido Community building.

==Sport and leisure==

Saltdean has a [[non-League football]] club [[Saltdean United F.C.]] who play at Hill Park. Saltdean also has 4 hard tennis courts, an outdoor Bowls green and a skateboard park all located within Saltdean Park. A sea swimming group meets weekly on the beach and holds traditional Boxing Day and New Year's Day swims.

==Cultural references==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Saltdean is referenced in the chapter \"The Sensational Sage of the Saltdean Stallion\" of the fantasy novel ''[[The Brightonomicon]]''. The book \"Poems from a Cave in Saltdean\" (2010) makes reference to local geography.

The changing landscape of Saltdean in the 20th century is referenced in the song \"'Ouses, 'Ouses, 'Ouses\" on the album \"The Imagined Village\" on Real World Records.  The song was co-written by John Copper, the sixth generation of his family to sing songs about Sussex, and reminisces about his grandfather's experience as a shepherd in the area.

Saltdean is situated by the sea in a 'Dean' (Saxon/Old English for 'dry valley'), with the surrounding hills of the South Downs National Park forming a large central dip and valley where the oval shaped Saltdean Park and Lido are located, looking out over the adjacent sea.

Tree lined roads and avenues radiate out in wide oval curves from the park in order to follow the contours of the local topography. The plan of the village was designed from inception to vary considerably from neighbouring Peacehaven's more grid-like system.

==Education==
Saltdean Primary School is the only school in Saltdean, it is well subscribed and very highly regarded. There is also a library located in the Lido Community building.

==Sport and leisure==

Saltdean has a [[non-League football]] club [[Saltdean United F.C.]] who play at Hill Park. Saltdean also has 4 hard tennis courts, an outdoor Bowls green and a skateboard park all located within Saltdean Park. A sea swimming group meets weekly on the beach and holds traditional Boxing Day and New Year's Day swims.

==Cultural references==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Saltdean is referenced in the chapter \"The Sensational Sage of the Saltdean Stallion\" of the fantasy novel ''[[The Brightonomicon]]''. The book \"Poems from a Cave in Saltdean\" (2010) makes reference to local geography.

The changing landscape of Saltdean in the 20th century is referenced in the song \"'Ouses, 'Ouses, 'Ouses\" on the album \"The Imagined Village\" on Real World Records.  The song was co-written by John Copper, the sixth generation of his family to sing songs about Sussex, and reminisces about his grandfather's experience as a shepherd in the area.

'''HMS ''G3''''' was a [[British G-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during World War I.

==Description==
The G-class submarines were designed by the [[Admiralty]] in response to a rumour that the Germans were building [[double hull|double-hulled]] submarines for overseas duties. The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>

The boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>

==Career==
Like the rest of her class, ''G3''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]].

In December 1921 ''G3'', out of commission, was being towed north to be broken up for scrap when she broke her tether and came ashore at Scalby Mills, north of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. The submarine later broke free from the shore and drifted back out to sea. She then drifted south, finally running aground under Buckton cliffs in Filey Bay, bow first. A local man, John Webster bought the salvage rights to the vessel and the wreck was scrapped. Lumps of the hulk were lifted up the sheer cliffs using ropes and pulleys, the salvers using rope ladders for access. The remains of the wreck lie under the cliffs at [[Buckton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Buckton]] including about {{convert|60|ft|m}} of the base of the hull, two diesel engines and their drive gear.

The boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>

==Career==
Like the rest of her class, ''G3''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]].

In December 1921 ''G3'', out of commission, was being towed north to be broken up for scrap when she broke her tether and came ashore at Scalby Mills, north of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. The submarine later broke free from the shore and drifted back out to sea. She then drifted south, finally running aground under Buckton cliffs in Filey Bay, bow first. A local man, John Webster bought the salvage rights to the vessel and the wreck was scrapped. Lumps of the hulk were lifted up the sheer cliffs using ropes and pulleys, the salvers using rope ladders for access. The remains of the wreck lie under the cliffs at [[Buckton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Buckton]] including about {{convert|60|ft|m}} of the base of the hull, two diesel engines and their drive gear.

'''William Henry Leder''' (May 5, 1918 – September 5, 1943) was a [[fighter pilot]] with the [[United States Naval Reserve]] (USNR) during [[World War II]]. He is credited with scoring multiple victories during the conflict flying a [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]. For actions during the [[Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]] he was awarded the [[Air Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=William Henry Leder |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24645703/william-henry-leder |website=Find a Grave}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Leder was born in [[Flasher, North Dakota]] in 1918, the son of Helena Augusta Wall and Carl Benjamin Leder. He attended [[Mandan High School]] in [[Mandan, North Dakota]]. After high school, he attended North Dakota State Teachers College for four years and graduated with a B.A. Degree. He taught in public schools in North Dakota for two years before enlisting. He enlisted in the Navy on April 12, 1941.<ref>U.S. World War II Navy Muster Rolls, 1938-1949</ref>

== World War II ==
[[File:VF-10 pilots on USS Enterprise (CV-6) c1942.jpg|thumb|left|200px|VF-10 pilots on {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] (William H. Leder in front row on knee, far left).]] Leder was initially stationed at the [[Minneapolis–Saint_Paul_Joint_Air_Reserve_Station|Naval Reserve Aviation Base]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. He became an aviation cadet on October 1, 1941 and attended flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]]. He was commissioned an ensign on May 15, 1942. On May 18 of that same year, he married Kathryn Silvia Loran<ref>Florida, County Marriage Records, 1823-1982</ref> before being transferred to Aircraft Carrier Training Group [[NAS San Diego]] in June. 

In August of 1942, he joined [[VF-10|Fighting Squadron 10]], the \"Grim Reapers\", before being shipped out to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]].<ref>National Archives Veterans' Service Records</ref>

Leder flew as a member of what was known as the [[Cactus Air Force]]. He was part of a large assembly of allied air power assigned to the [[Solomon Islands]] in support of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. As a member of [[VF-10]], he was stationed on the [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS Enterprise]] during the [[Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]] and flew multiple air combat patrol missions in defense of his carrier group against enemy Japanese forces.

In his first air combat engagement on October 26th, 1942, he shot down at least one enemy dive bomber in defense of the Enterprise. 

On November 13, 1942, he was part of a four plane flight on combat patrol over the Enterprise that intercepted and shot down a Japanese bomber shadowing the task force. 

Later on January 30, 1943, he shot down a torpedo bomber attempting to attack the cruiser [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|Chicago]] as it sat damaged near [[Rennell Island]].

== Air Medal ==
Leder was nominated by his commander for the Distinguished Flying Cross and was ultimately awarded the [[Air Medal]] for his actions in the Pacific.

'''Citation:'''

''Conspicuous courage and skill in air combat with the enemy. On October 26, 1942, while defending your carrier from air attack in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands, you destroyed one enemy dive bomber and probably destroyed another before they could release their bombs. In November 13, 1942, while a member of the combat patrol over the U.S.S. ENTERPRISE, you assisted in shooting down one four engine patrol bomber which was attempting to shadow your task force. On January 30, 1943, while on combat patrol over the damaged cruiser USS CHICAGO in the vicinity of Rennell Island, yourself and three other pilots intercepted, by sight contact, an enemy heavily armed twin engine torpedo bomber which was preceding an enemy attack group of twelve torpedo bombers for the obvious purpose of reconnoitering our forces and directing the attack. After a running fight lasting twenty minutes and carried on at speeds approaching 300 m.p.h., you succeeded in shooting the enemy down in flames. Your courage, tenacity, and skill were exemplary and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.''

== Later career and death ==
[[File:Bill Leder Headstone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Memorial headstone at [[Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park]].]]
After action in the Pacific, Leder moved to [[Woodinville, Washington]] and was stationed at the Ellensburg Army Airfield (today [[Bowers Airport|Bowers Field]]) in [[Ellensburg, Washington]] as a [[test pilot]]. On September 5th, 1943, the  Navy plane he was flying caught fire midair, and he crashed near the airfield and was killed. <ref>{{cite news |title=Flyer is Killed in Plane Crash |publisher=Ellensburg Daily Record |date=September 8, 1943}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Naval Flier Killed |work=Page 4 |publisher=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=September 9, 1943}}</ref>

'''Extra MSA Services Ltd''' is a company which operates 9 [[Motorway#Motorway service areas|motorway service stations]] in [[England]], mainly on primary routes. It is based at Beaconsfield services, previously being in the centre of [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]. It is also known as Extra MSA Forecourts Ltd. 

Many of the brands at Extra locations including 'M&S Simply Food', 'Costa' and 'Greggs' are operated by [[Moto Hospitality|Moto]], the UK's largest service area operator and Extra's biggest competitor.

==Market position==
Extra is the fourth largest service station operator in the UK behind [[Moto Hospitality|Moto]] (1st), [[Welcome Break]] (2nd) and [[RoadChef]] (3rd). It came into operation after the government deregulated motorway services to encourage more competition and its first site opened in December 2000, at Cambridge. Peterborough opened in January 2001 and Baldock in July 2001.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''William Henry Leder''' (May 5, 1918 – September 5, 1943) was a [[fighter pilot]] with the [[United States Naval Reserve]] (USNR) during [[World War II]]. He is credited with scoring multiple victories during the conflict flying a [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]. For actions during the [[Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]] he was awarded the [[Air Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=William Henry Leder |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24645703/william-henry-leder |website=Find a Grave}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Leder was born in [[Flasher, North Dakota]] in 1918, the son of Helena Augusta Wall and Carl Benjamin Leder. He attended [[Mandan High School]] in [[Mandan, North Dakota]]. After high school, he attended North Dakota State Teachers College for four years and graduated with a B.A. Degree. He taught in public schools in North Dakota for two years before enlisting. He enlisted in the Navy on April 12, 1941.<ref>U.S. World War II Navy Muster Rolls, 1938-1949</ref>

== World War II ==
[[File:VF-10 pilots on USS Enterprise (CV-6) c1942.jpg|thumb|left|200px|VF-10 pilots on {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] (William H. Leder in front row on knee, far left).]] Leder was initially stationed at the [[Minneapolis–Saint_Paul_Joint_Air_Reserve_Station|Naval Reserve Aviation Base]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. He became an aviation cadet on October 1, 1941 and attended flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]]. He was commissioned an ensign on May 15, 1942. On May 18 of that same year, he married Kathryn Silvia Loran<ref>Florida, County Marriage Records, 1823-1982</ref> before being transferred to Aircraft Carrier Training Group [[NAS San Diego]] in June. 

In August of 1942, he joined [[VF-10|Fighting Squadron 10]], the \"Grime Reapers\", before being shipped out to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]].<ref>National Archives Veterans' Service Records</ref>

Leder flew as a member of what was known as the [[Cactus Air Force]]. He was part of a large assembly of allied air power assigned to the [[Solomon Islands]] in support of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. As a member of [[VF-10]], he was stationed on the [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS Enterprise]] during the [[Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]] and flew multiple air combat patrol missions in defense of his carrier group against enemy Japanese forces.

In his first air combat engagement on October 26th, 1942, he shot down at least one enemy dive bomber in defense of the Enterprise. 

On November 13, 1942, he was part of a four plane flight on combat patrol over the Enterprise that intercepted and shot down a Japanese bomber shadowing the task force. 

Later on January 30, 1943, he shot down a torpedo bomber attempting to attack the cruiser [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|Chicago]] as it sat damaged near [[Rennell Island]]. 

== Air Medal ==
Leder was nominated by his commander for the Distinguished Flying Cross and was ultimately awarded the [[Air Medal]] for his actions in the Pacific.

'''Citation:'''

''Conspicuous courage and skill in air combat with the enemy. On October 26, 1942, while defending your carrier from air attack in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands, you destroyed one enemy dive bomber and probably destroyed another before they could release their bombs. In November 13, 1942, while a member of the combat patrol over the U.S.S. ENTERPRISE, you assisted in shooting down one four engine patrol bomber which was attempting to shadow your task force. On January 30, 1943, while on combat patrol over the damaged cruiser USS CHICAGO in the vicinity of Rennell Island, yourself and three other pilots intercepted, by sight contact, an enemy heavily armed twin engine torpedo bomber which was preceding an enemy attack group of twelve torpedo bombers for the obvious purpose of reconnoitering our forces and directing the attack. After a running fight lasting twenty minutes and carried on at speeds approaching 300 m.p.h., you succeeded in shooting the enemy down in flames. Your courage, tenacity, and skill were exemplary and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.''

== Later career and death ==
[[File:Bill Leder Headstone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Memorial headstone at [[Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park]].]]
After action in the Pacific, Leder moved to [[Woodinville, Washington]] and was stationed at the Ellensburg Army Airfield (today [[Bowers Airport|Bowers Field]]) in [[Ellensburg, Washington]] as a [[test pilot]]. On September 5th, 1943, the  Navy plane he was flying caught fire midair, and he crashed near the airfield and was killed. <ref>{{cite news |title=Flyer is Killed in Plane Crash |publisher=Ellensburg Daily Record |date=September 8, 1943}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Naval Flier Killed |work=Page 4 |publisher=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=September 9, 1943}}</ref>

'''Diego Minjarez is da bomb''', December 20, 1941) is an American actress.

==Early life==

Austin studied dancing at [[California State University, Sacramento|Sacramento State College]], and found work with the Tony Martin nightclub act upon arriving in Hollywood.<ref name=\"glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/521/Pamela+Austin/index.html|title=Pamela Austin profile|publisher=glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com|accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
[https://lego.com Diego] rulez, Talia droolz!!! In addition to appearing in two [[Elvis Presley]] films, in 1965-1967 Austin gained fame for a long series of popular automobile television commercials (and print ads) for [[Dodge]] (the [[Dodge Charger|Charger]], [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]], [[Dodge Polara|Polara]], and other models). As the perky \"Dodge Rebellion Girl\", she appeared in around twenty commercials as a [[damsel in distress]] — menaced by sharks, falling from a draw-bridge, a roof, a cargo plane, etc. Her tag line at the end of each ad was \"The Dodge Rebellion wants you!\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The ad series led to numerous film and television offers and a three-page profile in ''[[TV Guide]]'' (August 20–26, 1966). By 1968, Dodge executives felt Austin's popularity was overshadowing the cars and began a new \"Dodge Fever\" campaign with a different model, Joan Anita Parker.

In August 1967 she starred in the adventure-comedy film ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1967 film)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' based on the silent [[cliff-hanger]] [[Serial film|serial]].

In 1968 she was a semi-regular on the hit comedy series ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' during its first season. Austin performed in various comedy sketches, song-and-dance numbers, and pre-filmed segments, including an early music video for \"Buy For Me The Rain\" by [[The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]].<ref>{{IMDb name|0042487}}</ref>

'''Marquess of Reading''' is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33163 |date=18 May 1926 |page=3218}}</ref> It was created in 1926 for [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]], who had been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]] between 1904 and 1913, before serving as [[Viceroy of India]] and [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]]. He had already been created '''Baron Reading''', of [[Erleigh]] in the [[County of Berkshire]], in 1914,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28791 |date=9 January 1914 |page=258}}</ref> '''Viscount Reading''', of [[Earley|Erleigh]] in the County of Berkshire, in 1916,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=29651 |date=4 July 1916 |page=6597}}</ref> and '''Viscount Erleigh''', of [[Earley|Erleigh]] in the County of Berkshire, and '''Earl of Reading''', in 1917.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30442 |date=21 December 1917 |page=13384}}</ref> 

The marquessate of Reading is the highest title in the British peerage ever attained by a [[Jew]], and is the most recently created ''extant'' marquessate in the Peerage of the United Kingdom (that of [[Marquess of Willingdon|Willingdon]] was created in 1936 but became extinct in 1979). In this role, the marquessate of Reading is currently the junior-most marquessate in the [[Order of precedence in England and Wales]].

Upon the death of the [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|1st Marquess of Reading]], he was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He notably held ministerial office from 1951 to 1957 in the [[Conservative Government 1951-1957|Conservative administrations]] of [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Anthony Eden]]. {{As of|2013}} the titles are held by his grandson, the fourth Marquess, who succeeded his father in 1980. The family seat was Jaynes Court, near [[Bisley, Gloucestershire|Bisley]], [[Gloucestershire]].

In May 1804, the title of Baron Reading was offered to the outgoing Prime Minister, [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Henry Addington]], who had many links with the largely pre-industrialised town, as a subsidiary title of the customary retirement [[earldom]] for Prime Ministers. However, Addington refused the honour, though later accepting a peerage as [[Viscount Sidmouth]].

'''Gemeinde Schomberg''' ([[Upper_Silesia#Ethnolinguistic_structure_before_the_plebiscite|Polish]]: ''Gmina Szombierki''), was a [[Municipalities of Germany|municipality]] in the [[Bytom|District of Beuthen]], part of the [[Province of Silesia|Silesian Province]] of Germany. Its seat was the town of [[Szombierki|Schomberg]] (now a district of [[Bytom]]).

==History==
During the [[Upper Silesian plebiscite]] in 1921, 3328 people in the Schomberg municipality took part in the voting.

Even though the majority of Schomberg's residents voted to join Poland, the city remained under German rule after the plebiscite era.

In 1930 the municipality became the owner of the [[Fazaniec (Bytom)|Fazaniec Park]].

The municipality of Schomberg ceased to exist in 1945 following the [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|Polish takeover of Silesia]]. Under the new Polish administration a new [[Gmina|municipality]] (Gmina) was formed in Schomberg and the town's name was changed to Chruszczów.

'''Gemeinde Schomberg''' ([[Upper_Silesia#Ethnolinguistic_structure_before_the_plebiscite|Polish]]: ''Gmina Szombierki''), was a [[Municipalities of Germany|municipality]] in the [[Bytom|District of Beuthen]], part of the [[Province of Silesia|Silesian Province]] of Germany. Its seat was the town of [[Szombierki|Schomberg]] (now a district of [[Bytom]]).

==History==
During the [[Upper Silesian plebiscite]] in 1921, 3328 people in the Schomberg municipality took part in the voting.

Even though the majority of Schomberg's residents voted to join Poland, the city remained under German rule after the plebiscite era.

In 1930 the municipality became the owner of the [[Fazaniec (Bytom)|Fazaniec Park]].

The municipality of Schomberg ceased to exist in 1945 following the [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|Polish takeover of Silesia]]. Under the new Polish administration a new [[Gmina|municipality]] (Gmina) was formed in Schomberg and the town's name was changed to Chruszczów.

'''Bob Hay''' born '''Robert Donald Hay, Jr.''' on January 28, 1950, is an American songwriter and the multi-instrumentalist and vocalist for [[Athens, Georgia]] projects the [[Squalls (band)|Squalls]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p27011|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Squalls|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> [[Bob Hay & the Jolly Beggars]], [[Noogeez]], [[A. Che Why]] and [[Supercluster (band)|Supercluster]].

==Biography==

Hay was born on January 28, 1950, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] to a postal worker and housewife. He attended [[Aquinas College (Michigan)|Aquinas College]] (Grand Rapids) and worked as a school teacher and as a statistician prior to divorcing his first wife and  moving to [[Kennebunkport, Maine]].

===As musician===

Hay was convinced by [[Ken Starratt]] to move to [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], Georgia, from Maine after making a trip to Athens in the late 1970s and surveying the blossoming music scene. Bob met other local musicians including roommate \"Big\" Al Walsh, [[Mig Little]] and [[Diana Torell]] and formed the band the Squalls. They were well known for switching instruments and singing duties during their shows. In 1986, they were featured in the movie ''[[Athens, GA: Inside Out]]''. The Squalls underwent various lineup changes after Mig Little left the band. They were joined by [[Mark Cooper Smith]], Juan Molina, Paul Hammond and others at various times during their career. The Squalls made a self-released e.p. and single, as well as two albums for [[Dog Gone It Records]]-a label owned by [[Jefferson Holt]], the manager for [[R.E.M.|REM]]. The Squalls made several trips up and down the East coast of the U.S. and a trip through the mid-West before disbanding.

Hay never stopped jamming with his friends and briefly performed with a project called the Yams who learned covers of songs in hopes of playing bars and fraternity parties. This is where he began his association with multi-instrumentalist [[Bill David]], a local musician with deep roots in the community.

Bob Hay & the Jolly Beggars began as a solo project. Hay became fascinated with the works of [[Robert Burns]], the 18th century Scottish bard, after a random comment which was made during a jam session. He found songs by Robert Burns at the [[University of Georgia]] library and began to learn and arrange them. Other former members of the Squalls, including Ken Starratt's youngest son Gabriel Fricks-Starratt, became interested and joined. They have released 3 CDs and perform sporadically in and around Athens, Georgia.

Noogeez was dreamed up by Ken Starratt as a way to use Bob's older Squalls material in a kid-friendly format. 2 videos have been made so far using this material. Members of this band include  Ken and [[Jorma Starratt]], Ken's son.  Their first video, \"Kathy\", won the audience choice award during the 2007 [[Athfest]] [[Sprocket]]s competition.

'''Bob Hay''' born '''Robert Donald Hay, Jr.''' on January 28, 1950, is an American songwriter and the multi-instrumentalist and vocalist for [[Athens, Georgia]] projects the [[Squalls (band)|Squalls]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p27011|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Squalls|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> [[Bob Hay & the Jolly Beggars]], [[Noogeez]], [[A. Che Why]] and [[Supercluster (band)|Supercluster]].

==Biography==

Hay was born on January 28, 1950, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] to a postal worker and housewife. He attended [[Aquinas College (Michigan)|Aquinas College]] (Grand Rapids) and worked as a school teacher and as a statistician prior to divorcing his first wife and  moving to [[Kennebunkport, Maine]].

===As musician===

Hay was convinced by [[Ken Starratt]] to move to [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], Georgia, from Maine after making a trip to Athens in the late 1970s and surveying the blossoming music scene. Bob met other local musicians including roommate \"Big\" Al Walsh, [[Mig Little]] and [[Diana Torell]] and formed the band the Squalls. They were well known for switching instruments and singing duties during their shows. In 1986, they were featured in the movie ''[[Athens, GA: Inside Out]]''. The Squalls underwent various lineup changes after Mig Little left the band. They were joined by [[Mark Cooper Smith]], Juan Molina, Paul Hammond and others at various times during their career. The Squalls made a self-released e.p. and single, as well as two albums for [[Dog Gone It Records]]-a label owned by [[Jefferson Holt]], the manager for [[R.E.M.|REM]]. The Squalls made several trips up and down the East coast of the U.S. and a trip through the mid-West before disbanding.

Hay never stopped jamming with his friends and briefly performed with a project called the Yams who learned covers of songs in hopes of playing bars and fraternity parties. This is where he began his association with multi-instrumentalist [[Bill David]], a local musician with deep roots in the community.

Bob Hay & the Jolly Beggars began as a solo project. Hay became fascinated with the works of [[Robert Burns]], the 18th century Scottish bard, after a random comment which was made during a jam session. He found songs by Robert Burns at the [[University of Georgia]] library and began to learn and arrange them. Other former members of the Squalls, including Ken Starratt's youngest son Gabriel Fricks-Starratt, became interested and joined. They have released 3 CDs and perform sporadically in and around Athens, Georgia.

Noogeez was dreamed up by Ken Starratt as a way to use Bob's older Squalls material in a kid-friendly format. 2 videos have been made so far using this material. Members of this band include  Ken and [[Jorma Starratt]], Ken's son.  Their first video, \"Kathy\", won the audience choice award during the 2007 [[Athfest]] [[Sprocket]]s competition.

''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi7Wtx336nU A. Che Why]'' is Hay's latest project. He records his ideas and songs using just a sequencer and a guitar. Sometimes he \"records in the morning\" and has his work on [[My Space]] \"by the evening.\"{{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}

→‎Protected management frames:Added single quotes around w to increase readability,safe,Forofar,"{{more footnotes|date=August 2013}}
'''IEEE 802.11w-2009''' is an approved amendment to the [[IEEE 802.11]] standard to increase the security of its management frames.

== Protected management frames ==
Current 802.11 standard defines \"frame\" types for use in management and control of wireless links. IEEE 802.11w is the Protected Management Frames [[standardization|standard]] for the [[IEEE 802.11]] family of standards. Task Group 'w' worked on improving the [[IEEE 802.11]] Medium Access Control layer<ref>{{cite web |title=Quick Guide to IEEE 802.11 Activities |url=http://ieee802.org/11/QuickGuide_IEEE_802_WG_and_Activities.htm |website=IEEE802 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>. Its objective was to increase security by providing data confidentiality of management frames, mechanisms that enable data integrity, [[data origin authenticity]], and replay protection. These extensions interact with [[IEEE 802.11r]] and [[IEEE 802.11u]].
=== Overview ===
* Single and unified solution needed for all IEEE 802.11 Protection-capable Management Frames.
* It uses the existing security mechanisms rather than creating new security scheme or new management frame format.
* It is an optional feature in 802.11 and is required for 802.11 implementations that support TKIP or CCMP. 
* Its use is optional and can be negotiable between STAs.

=== Classes ===
* Class 1
** Beacon and probe request/response
** Authentication and de-authentication
** Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
** Spectrum management action
** Radio measurement action between STAs in IBSS
* Class 2
** Association request/response
** Re-association request/response
** Disassociation
* Class 3
** Disassociation/de-authentication
** QoS action frame
** Radio measurement action in infrastructure BSS
** Future 11v management frames

==Unprotected frames==
Infeasible/not possible to protect the frame sent before four-ways handshake because it is sent prior to key establishment. The management frames, which are sent after key establishment, can be protected. Any management frame that is sent before key establishment is infeasible to protect.

Infeasible to protect:
* Beacon and probe request/response
* Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
* Authentication
* Association request/response
* Spectrum management action

==Protected frames==
Protection-capable management frames are those sent after key establishment that can be protected using existing protection key hierarchy in 802.11 and its amendments.

Only TKIP/AES frames are protected and WEP/open frames are not protected
* Disassociation and deauthentication
* Radio measurement action for infrastructure BSS (802.11k frames)
* QoS action frame (802.11e frames)
* Future 11v management frames (802.11v frames)

Protection-capable Management Frames are protected by the same cipher suite as an ordinary data MPDU.

* MPDU payload is TKIP or CCMP encrypted.
* MPDU payload and header are TKIP or CCMP integrity protected.
* Protected frame subfield of frame control field is set.
* Only cipher suites already implemented required.
* Sender's pairwise temporal key (PTK) protects unicast management frame, and group temporal key (GTK) is used to protect broadcast/multicast management frame.
* A RSN (802.11i) IE capability bit used to signal whether Protection-capable Management frames are protected.

== Replay protection ==
Replay protection is provided by already existing mechanisms. Specifically, there is a (per-station per-key per-priority) counter of each transmitted frame; this is used as a nonce/initialisation vector (IV) in cryptographic encapsulation/decapsulation, and the receiving station ensures that the received counter is increasing.

==Usage==
The 802.11w standard is implemented in Linux and BSD's as part of the 80211mac driver code base, which is used by several wireless driver interfaces; i.e., ath9k. The feature is easily enabled in most recent kernels and Linux OS's using these combinations. [[OpenWrt]] in particular provides an easy toggle as part of the base distribution. The feature has been implemented for the first time into [[Microsoft]] [[operating systems]] in Windows 8. This has caused a number of compatibility issues particularly with wireless access points that are not compatible with the standard. Rolling back the wireless adapter driver to one from Windows 7 usually fixes the issue.

[[pl:802.11w]]","{{more footnotes|date=August 2013}}
'''IEEE 802.11w-2009''' is an approved amendment to the [[IEEE 802.11]] standard to increase the security of its management frames.

== Protected management frames ==
Current 802.11 standard defines \"frame\" types for use in management and control of wireless links. IEEE 802.11w is the Protected Management Frames [[standardization|standard]] for the [[IEEE 802.11]] family of standards. Task Group w worked on improving the [[IEEE 802.11]] Medium Access Control layer<ref>{{cite web |title=Quick Guide to IEEE 802.11 Activities |url=http://ieee802.org/11/QuickGuide_IEEE_802_WG_and_Activities.htm |website=IEEE802 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>. Its objective was to increase security by providing data confidentiality of management frames, mechanisms that enable data integrity, [[data origin authenticity]], and replay protection. These extensions interact with [[IEEE 802.11r]] and [[IEEE 802.11u]].
=== Overview ===
* Single and unified solution needed for all IEEE 802.11 Protection-capable Management Frames.
* It uses the existing security mechanisms rather than creating new security scheme or new management frame format.
* It is an optional feature in 802.11 and is required for 802.11 implementations that support TKIP or CCMP. 
* Its use is optional and can be negotiable between STAs.

=== Classes ===
* Class 1
** Beacon and probe request/response
** Authentication and de-authentication
** Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
** Spectrum management action
** Radio measurement action between STAs in IBSS
* Class 2
** Association request/response
** Re-association request/response
** Disassociation
* Class 3
** Disassociation/de-authentication
** QoS action frame
** Radio measurement action in infrastructure BSS
** Future 11v management frames

==Unprotected frames==
Infeasible/not possible to protect the frame sent before four-ways handshake because it is sent prior to key establishment. The management frames, which are sent after key establishment, can be protected. Any management frame that is sent before key establishment is infeasible to protect.

Infeasible to protect:
* Beacon and probe request/response
* Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
* Authentication
* Association request/response
* Spectrum management action

==Protected frames==
Protection-capable management frames are those sent after key establishment that can be protected using existing protection key hierarchy in 802.11 and its amendments.

Only TKIP/AES frames are protected and WEP/open frames are not protected
* Disassociation and deauthentication
* Radio measurement action for infrastructure BSS (802.11k frames)
* QoS action frame (802.11e frames)
* Future 11v management frames (802.11v frames)

Protection-capable Management Frames are protected by the same cipher suite as an ordinary data MPDU.

* MPDU payload is TKIP or CCMP encrypted.
* MPDU payload and header are TKIP or CCMP integrity protected.
* Protected frame subfield of frame control field is set.
* Only cipher suites already implemented required.
* Sender's pairwise temporal key (PTK) protects unicast management frame, and group temporal key (GTK) is used to protect broadcast/multicast management frame.
* A RSN (802.11i) IE capability bit used to signal whether Protection-capable Management frames are protected.

== Replay protection ==
Replay protection is provided by already existing mechanisms. Specifically, there is a (per-station per-key per-priority) counter of each transmitted frame; this is used as a nonce/initialisation vector (IV) in cryptographic encapsulation/decapsulation, and the receiving station ensures that the received counter is increasing.

==Usage==
The 802.11w standard is implemented in Linux and BSD's as part of the 80211mac driver code base, which is used by several wireless driver interfaces; i.e., ath9k. The feature is easily enabled in most recent kernels and Linux OS's using these combinations. [[OpenWrt]] in particular provides an easy toggle as part of the base distribution. The feature has been implemented for the first time into [[Microsoft]] [[operating systems]] in Windows 8. This has caused a number of compatibility issues particularly with wireless access points that are not compatible with the standard. Rolling back the wireless adapter driver to one from Windows 7 usually fixes the issue.

'''Whitwell''' is a small village located in [[Derbyshire]], England. The population of the civil parish (including Whitwell Common) taken at the 2011 Census was 3,900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11130606&c=Whitwell&d=16&e=62&g=6413200&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1458312682616&enc=1|title=Civil Parish population 2011|accessdate=18 March 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}</ref>

Although Whitwell celebrated its 1,000th anniversary in the 'Whitwell 1000' celebrations of 1989, it is much older than this celebration suggests. The earliest written references to Whitwell are from the Anglo-Saxon charters. However, many of its historical sites predate this period. Within the parish are several [[Iron Age]] burial mounds, an Iron Age fort and settlement, the remains of a Roman villa, medieval field systems, and both a Norman and Saxon church, the world heritage site of [[Creswell Crags]] was until recently within the parish. [[Whitwell Old Hall]] is a medieval manor house.

Whitwell won the 'Best Kept Village in Derbyshire' Award in 1988.

Whitwell is a thriving village with strong community spirit. The village has many active clubs and societies, including Whitwell Scout and Guide Group, Local History Group, Whitwell Players, Whitwell Brass Band and junior band, C of E, Methodist and Poplar churches, Natural History Group, green bowls club, cricket club, and football club.

Although being quite a small village, Whitwell has six public houses.  It previously had as many as 11 and held the record for most number of licensed premises per capita. The current pubs are Holmefield Arms, The Jack Ups (Whitwell Working Men's Club), New Middle Club, The Boot And Shoe, The Half Moon and The Royal Oak. The biggest employer just outside the village is La Farge Works (formerly Steetley Company), which run a quarry which supplies limestone and other products all around the world.

==Whitwell Wood==
Whitwell Wood is a large area of ancient woodland covering approximately 171 hectares. It forms part of the Welbeck Estate, one of the former medieval dukeries of Nottinghamshire. The wood is managed on a long term lease by the Forestry Commission. It is a predominantly broad-leaved wood with over 20 species indicating ancient woodland, a number of interesting archaeological features and a freshwater spring known as the Ginny Spring. The spring is designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This designation is partly due to the varied flora, but also because of a number of species that are rare in the region. As such, the wood has a very high nature conservation status. A [[Three Shire Oak]] once stood in a field adjacent to Whitwell Wood. The oak traditionally marked the meeting point of the borders of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. However, the tree actually stood some distance to the south of the actual border, which is located closer to the Nottinghamshire village of [[Shireoaks]].
Only Whitwell, Elmton & Thorp (Salvin) were the original Saxon towns. Before Creswell Village was built around the colliery in the late 19th century, Creswell Crags was known on local farms  as Whitwell Crags. This may be what was referred to when King Alfred's grandson, King Edmund conquered the 5 Boroughs from the Viking Earls, the Saxon poets record him reaching as far as Dore & Hwitan Wylles Geat' (the Whitwell Gap).

==Famous Whitwellians==
One of Whitwell's most famous sons was [[Joe Davis]], world snooker and billiards champion from the 1920s to the 1940s. His Whitwell home (on Welbeck Street) bears a plaque commemorating him.

[[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]], [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]]<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/859/859.html Les Jackson at CricketArchive.com]</ref> in 1959, played for Whitwell Cricket Club and came to watch their games on a Saturday afternoon until his death in 2007.

Also from the village are [[Chris Adams (cricketer)|Chris Adams]], the [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Ian Bennett (footballer)|Ian Bennett]], a professional goalkeeper who currently plays for [[Huddersfield Town]], whose family still lives in the village.

Celebrated Great War poet, William Streets was also from the village.

The village is the birthplace and childhood home of [[J. T. Edson]] the author, whose various escapism-adventure series sold over 27 million copies globally; the Edson family lived in Whitwell from Victorian times.

'''''An Englishman's Castle''''' is a [[BBC]] television serial first broadcast in 1978, written by [[Philip Mackie]] and directed by Paul Ciappessoni. The story was set in an [[alternative history]] 1970s, in which [[Nazi Germany]] won [[World War II]] and [[England]] is run by a collaborationist fascist government. Peter Ingram ([[Kenneth More]]) is a writer for a soap opera (also called ''An Englishman's Castle''), which is set in [[London]] in 1940, during the fictional Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation.

==Plot==
Peter Ingram is a successful London screenwriter, the creator of one of the most popular television shows in Nazi-occupied Europe, ''An Englishman's Castle''. It is a period soap opera, following an ordinary London family during an imagined German invasion of England in 1940. Ingram is oblivious to Nazi rule, which is hidden behind a façade of seemingly-normal English daily life. The invasion was followed by several years of guerrilla warfare, which ended in a truce with Germany and an amnesty that enabled the resisters to resume normal daily life in return for accepting the reality of German occupation, which they generally did, feeling that further resistance was futile.

Ingram's show furthers the feeling among the population in the present (1978) and so is highly valuable to the authorities. A kind of normality was restored, with few Germans to be seen in the streets. German rule is maintained mainly through an extensive system of collaborators, known as \"[[delator]]s\". When dissidents are detained it is done by polite, soft-spoken English police, but they are then delivered to horrible torture chambers, kept discreetly out of sight.

Ingram gradually becomes aware of the real state of things. Firstly, he encounters his superiors' firm objection to the inclusion of a character with a [[Jewish]] name in the series. The series is largely based on his own life, he argues, and the Jewish man was a real friend. However, having such a character would violate the official policy of letting the [[Holocaust|extermination of the Jews]] remain forgotten, never discussed openly. Then, Ingram discovers that his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], Jill, one of the stars of his show, is secretly Jewish and a member of an underground [[resistance movement]]. Eventually, his loyalties are tested, and he sides with the resistance.

When the resistance decides to include the [[code word]] that will signal a nationwide [[insurgency]] in his show, due to its huge audience, he complies, allowing Sally (Jill) to speak the phrase when it is filmed. However, in the closing scene, he locks himself in his office as the episode is broadcast, cuts off the feed just before her scene airs, and speaks the phrase himself instead, live over the air. As the sounds of a rebellion against the collaborationist government begin to come through the windows of his office, Ingram awaits the [[secret police]], when someone breaks down the door and he turns to stare at the unseen intruder.

'''''An Englishman's Castle''''' is a [[BBC]] television serial first broadcast in 1978, written by [[Philip Mackie]] and directed by Paul Ciappessoni. The story was set in an [[alternative history]] 1970s, in which [[Nazi Germany]] won [[World War II]] and [[England]] is run by a collaborationist fascist government. Peter Ingram ([[Kenneth More]]) is a writer for a soap opera (also called ''An Englishman's Castle''), which is set in [[London]] in 1940, during the fictional Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation.

==Plot==
Peter Ingram is a successful London screenwriter, the creator of one of the most popular television shows in Nazi-occupied Europe, ''An Englishman's Castle''. It is a period soap opera, following an ordinary London family during an imagined German invasion of England in 1940. Ingram is oblivious to Nazi rule, which is hidden behind a façade of seemingly-normal English daily life. The invasion was followed by several years of guerrilla warfare, which ended in a truce with Germany and an amnesty that enabled the resisters to resume normal daily life in return for accepting the reality of German occupation, which they generally did, feeling that further resistance was futile.

Ingram's show furthers the feeling among the population in the present (1978) and so is highly valuable to the authorities. A kind of normality was restored, with few Germans to be seen in the streets. German rule is maintained mainly through an extensive system of collaborators, known as \"[[delator]]s\". When dissidents are detained it is done by polite, soft-spoken English police, but they are then delivered to horrible torture chambers, kept discreetly out of sight.

Ingram gradually becomes aware of the real state of things. Firstly, he encounters his superiors' firm objection to the inclusion of a character with a [[Jewish]] name in the series. The series is largely based on his own life, he argues, and the Jewish man was a real friend. However, having such a character would violate the official policy of letting the [[Holocaust|extermination of the Jews]] remain forgotten, never discussed openly. Then, Ingram discovers that his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], Jill, one of the stars of his show, is secretly Jewish and a member of an underground [[resistance movement]]. Eventually, his loyalties are tested, and he sides with the resistance.

When the resistance decides to include the [[code word]] that will signal a nationwide [[insurgency]] in his show, due to its huge audience, he complies, allowing Sally (Jill) to speak the phrase when it is filmed. However, in the closing scene, he locks himself in his office as the episode is broadcast, cuts off the feed just before her scene airs, and speaks the phrase himself instead, live over the air. As the sounds of a rebellion against the collaborationist government begin to come through the windows of his office, Ingram awaits the [[secret police]], when someone breaks down the door and he turns to stare at the unseen intruder.

'''IEEE 802.11w-2009''' is an approved amendment to the [[IEEE 802.11]] standard to increase the security of its management frames.

== Protected management frames ==
Current 802.11 standard defines \"frame\" types for use in management and control of wireless links. IEEE 802.11w is the Protected Management Frames [[standardization|standard]] for the [[IEEE 802.11]] family of standards. Task Group 'w' worked on improving the [[IEEE 802.11]] Medium Access Control layer<ref>{{cite web |title=Quick Guide to IEEE 802.11 Activities |url=http://ieee802.org/11/QuickGuide_IEEE_802_WG_and_Activities.htm |website=IEEE802 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>. Its objective was to increase security by providing data confidentiality of management frames, mechanisms that enable data integrity, [[data origin authenticity]], and replay protection. These extensions interact with [[IEEE 802.11r]] and [[IEEE 802.11u]].
=== Overview ===
* Single and unified solution needed for all IEEE 802.11 Protection-capable Management Frames.
* It uses the existing security mechanisms rather than creating new security scheme or new management frame format.
* It is an optional feature in 802.11 and is required for 802.11 implementations that support TKIP or CCMP. 
* Its use is optional and can be negotiable between STAs.

=== Classes ===
* Class 1
** Beacon and probe request/response
** Authentication and de-authentication
** Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
** Spectrum management action
** Radio measurement action between STAs in IBSS
* Class 2
** Association request/response
** Re-association request/response
** Disassociation
* Class 3
** Disassociation/de-authentication
** QoS action frame
** Radio measurement action in infrastructure BSS
** Future 11v management frames

==Unprotected frames==
It is infeasible/not possible to protect the frame sent before four-ways handshake because it is sent prior to key establishment. The management frames, which are sent after key establishment, can be protected.

Infeasible to protect:
* Beacon and probe request/response
* Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
* Authentication
* Association request/response
* Spectrum management action

==Protected frames==
Protection-capable management frames are those sent after key establishment that can be protected using existing protection key hierarchy in 802.11 and its amendments.

Only TKIP/AES frames are protected and WEP/open frames are not protected
* Disassociation and deauthentication
* Radio measurement action for infrastructure BSS (802.11k frames)
* QoS action frame (802.11e frames)
* Future 11v management frames (802.11v frames)

Protection-capable Management Frames are protected by the same cipher suite as an ordinary data MPDU.

* MPDU payload is TKIP or CCMP encrypted.
* MPDU payload and header are TKIP or CCMP integrity protected.
* Protected frame subfield of frame control field is set.
* Only cipher suites already implemented required.
* Sender's pairwise temporal key (PTK) protects unicast management frame, and group temporal key (GTK) is used to protect broadcast/multicast management frame.
* A RSN (802.11i) IE capability bit used to signal whether Protection-capable Management frames are protected.

== Replay protection ==
Replay protection is provided by already existing mechanisms. Specifically, there is a (per-station per-key per-priority) counter of each transmitted frame; this is used as a nonce/initialisation vector (IV) in cryptographic encapsulation/decapsulation, and the receiving station ensures that the received counter is increasing.

==Usage==
The 802.11w standard is implemented in Linux and BSD's as part of the 80211mac driver code base, which is used by several wireless driver interfaces; i.e., ath9k. The feature is easily enabled in most recent kernels and Linux OS's using these combinations. [[OpenWrt]] in particular provides an easy toggle as part of the base distribution. The feature has been implemented for the first time into [[Microsoft]] [[operating systems]] in Windows 8. This has caused a number of compatibility issues particularly with wireless access points that are not compatible with the standard. Rolling back the wireless adapter driver to one from Windows 7 usually fixes the issue.

<!-- Add specific details here -->
[[Wireless LAN]]s send system management information in unprotected frames, which makes them vulnerable. This standard protects against network disruption caused by malicious systems that forge disassociation requests that appear to be sent by valid equipment.<ref>http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xxpIIlf9q5sJ:www.ieee802.org/21/sept05_meeting_docs/21-05-0381-00-0000-802-11-liaison-September05.ppt+802.11w&hl=en&client=firefox-a{{Dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

A group of gang members led by Miyamoto capture Sachiko Ozawa, a high school student, in [[Chiba Prefecture]], and after assaulting her at a hotel, confine her at a house in E-Ward, eastern Tokyo, where they commit acts of rape and torture. Her sister Miki frantically attempts to find her and takes the initiative, distributing flyers. Hiroki Marukawa, the main character and a schoolmate of Miki, is so intimidated by the other characters that he outs Sachiko when she attempts to hide, and she fails to disclose his information to Miki, despite being prompted by Miki. Despite the hazards to her life, Miki is led to the house by gangsters, and, along with Sachiko, is rescued by police following on a tip before the gangsters attempt to kill her. Hiroki, unlike his fellow co-conspirators, is tried as a juvenile and adjudicated delinquent, being incarcerated at a [[juvenile reformatory|reformatory]], instead of being [[tried as an adult]] and going to a prison for adults. Hiroki becomes the leader of his dormitory at the reformatory.<!--Chapter 33--> As fellow gang member Takashi Ikuno is the only murdered victim, ringleader Miyamoto avoids the [[Capital punishment in Japan|death penalty]]. Miki does not forgive Hiroki despite his pleas, as he failed to rescue Sachiko at opportune times. Sachiko ultimately survives her torture and injuries.
