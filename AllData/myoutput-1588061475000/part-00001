The city's name is derived from the company's name, and was selected after several earlier proposals had been considered and rejected.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/living/history | title=Coral Springs: History }}</ref> Despite the name, there are no natural [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] in the city; Florida's springs are found in the central and northern portions of the state.<ref name=nosprings>{{cite web |url=http://fl.water.usgs.gov/PDF_files/fs151_95_spechler.pdf |title=Springs of Florida |publisher=United States Geological Survey |last1=Spechler |first1=Rick M |last2=Schiffer |first2=Donna M. |accessdate=July 19, 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s the young city grew rapidly, adding over 35,000 residents each decade. Coral Springs has notably strict building codes, which are designed to maintain the city's distinctive aesthetic appeal. The city government's effective fiscal management has maintained high bond ratings, and the city has won accolades for its overall livability, its low crime rate, and its family-friendly orientation.\n\n==History==\nCoral Springs is a [[planned community]]. Prior to its incorporation as a city in July 1963, the area which is now Coral Springs was part of {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of marshy lands bought by Henry Lyons between 1911 and 1939. After several [[1947 Atlantic hurricane season|floods]] in 1947, Florida created the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District (now the [[South Florida Water Management District]]). [[Canals]] and [[levees]] drained much of the area upon which Coral Springs was built. After the land was drained and cleared, most of the area was used as a bean farm. After Lyons' death in 1952, his heirs changed the focus to cattle.<ref name=history/>\n\nA post-[[World War II]] real estate boom in South Florida attracted the interest of developers. Coral Ridge Properties, which already had several developments in [[Broward County]], bought {{convert|3869|acre|km2|0}} of land from the Lyons family on December 14, 1961 for $1 million.<ref name=history/> The City of Coral Springs was chartered on July 10, 1963. Other names that were considered for the new city included \"Curran Village,\" \"Pompano Springs\" and \"Quartermore\". By 1964, the company had developed a master plan for a city of 50,000 residents. On July 22, 1964, the first sale of 536 building lots netted $1.6 million. The [[Coral Springs Covered Bridge|landmark covered bridge]] was built that same year to promote the town. In 1965, Coral Ridge Properties bought an additional {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} from the Lyons family, increasing the city's land area to {{convert|16|sqmi|km2|0}}. The first city government elections were held in 1967.\n\nThe city added 19 public schools, a regional mall, shopping centers and parks between 1970 and 2000 in response to rapid population growth. The biggest [[shopping mall]] in the city is [[Coral Square]], which opened in October 1984 with {{convert|945000|sqft|m2|-2}} of retail space and more than 120 stores. The construction of the [[Sawgrass Expressway]] in 1986 brought even more growth. A museum and a theater opened in the 1990s. The city reached residential [[build-out]] in 2003<ref name=sfmc>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/home/showdocument?id=2738 | title=City of Coral Springs: Business Plan Development Business Plan Development Workshop | date=June 23, 2004 }}</ref> and is very close to a commercial build-out.<ref>{{cite web | title=Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance: Coral Springs | url=http://www.gflalliance.org/information-center/coral-springs/ | publisher=Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and rankings==\nIn 2012, the city was ranked 94th overall and 3rd in Florida on the '''100 Best Places to Live '' list published by ''[[Money Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sfl-mtblog-2012-08-money_ranks_coral_springs_in_t-story.html | title=Money ranks Coral Springs in top 100 Best Places to Live | first=Arun | last=Sivasankaran | magazine=[[Money Magazine]] | date=August 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Coral Springs became the first state or local government in the nation to receive the [[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://patapsco.nist.gov/Award_Recipients/PDF_Files/Coral_Springs_Profile.pdf | title=Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award 2007 Award Recipient, Nonprofit: The City of Coral Springs | publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] | access-date=October 26, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122152525/http://patapsco.nist.gov/Award_Recipients/PDF_Files/Coral_Springs_Profile.pdf | archive-date=January 22, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe city has received the Florida Sterling Award for excellence in administration twice, in 1997 and 2003.<ref name=AwSterling>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/government/other-departments-and-services/budget-strategy/baldrige-award-and-other-recognitions | title=Baldrige Award and Other Recognitions | publisher=City of Coral Springs}}</ref>\n\n==Crime==\nThe city's historically low crime rate was marred in the early 1990s, when teen gang violence made headlines, with fights and murders reported.

Coral Springs has notably strict building codes, which are designed to maintain the city's distinctive aesthetic appeal. The city government's effective fiscal management has maintained high bond ratings, and the city has won accolades for its overall livability, its low crime rate, and its family-friendly orientation.\n\n==History==\nCoral Springs is a [[planned community]]. Prior to its incorporation as a city in July 1963, the area which is now Coral Springs was part of {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of marshy lands bought by Henry Lyons between 1911 and 1939. After several [[1947 Atlantic hurricane season|floods]] in 1947, Florida created the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District (now the [[South Florida Water Management District]]). [[Canals]] and [[levees]] drained much of the area upon which Coral Springs was built. After the land was drained and cleared, most of the area was used as a bean farm. After Lyons' death in 1952, his heirs changed the focus to cattle.<ref name=history/>\n\nA post-[[World War II]] real estate boom in South Florida attracted the interest of developers. Coral Ridge Properties, which already had several developments in [[Broward County]], bought {{convert|3869|acre|km2|0}} of land from the Lyons family on December 14, 1961 for $1 million.<ref name=history/> The City of Coral Springs was chartered on July 10, 1963. Other names that were considered for the new city included \"Curran Village,\" \"Pompano Springs\" and \"Quartermore\". By 1964, the company had developed a master plan for a city of 50,000 residents. On July 22, 1964, the first sale of 536 building lots netted $1.6 million. The [[Coral Springs Covered Bridge|landmark covered bridge]] was built that same year to promote the town. In 1965, Coral Ridge Properties bought an additional {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} from the Lyons family, increasing the city's land area to {{convert|16|sqmi|km2|0}}. The first city government elections were held in 1967.\n\nThe city added 19 public schools, a regional mall, shopping centers and parks between 1970 and 2000 in response to rapid population growth. The biggest [[shopping mall]] in the city is [[Coral Square]], which opened in October 1984 with {{convert|945000|sqft|m2|-2}} of retail space and more than 120 stores. The construction of the [[Sawgrass Expressway]] in 1986 brought even more growth. A museum and a theater opened in the 1990s. The city reached residential [[build-out]] in 2003<ref name=sfmc>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/home/showdocument?id=2738 | title=City of Coral Springs: Business Plan Development Business Plan Development Workshop | date=June 23, 2004 }}</ref> and is very close to a commercial build-out.<ref>{{cite web | title=Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance: Coral Springs | url=http://www.gflalliance.org/information-center/coral-springs/ | publisher=Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and rankings==\nIn 2012, the city was ranked 94th overall and 3rd in Florida on the '''100 Best Places to Live '' list published by ''[[Money Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sfl-mtblog-2012-08-money_ranks_coral_springs_in_t-story.html | title=Money ranks Coral Springs in top 100 Best Places to Live | first=Arun | last=Sivasankaran | magazine=[[Money Magazine]] | date=August 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Coral Springs became the first state or local government in the nation to receive the [[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://patapsco.nist.gov/Award_Recipients/PDF_Files/Coral_Springs_Profile.pdf | title=Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award 2007 Award Recipient, Nonprofit: The City of Coral Springs | publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] | access-date=October 26, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122152525/http://patapsco.nist.gov/Award_Recipients/PDF_Files/Coral_Springs_Profile.pdf | archive-date=January 22, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe city has received the Florida Sterling Award for excellence in administration twice, in 1997 and 2003.<ref name=AwSterling>{{cite web | url=http://www.coralsprings.org/government/other-departments-and-services/budget-strategy/baldrige-award-and-other-recognitions | title=Baldrige Award and Other Recognitions | publisher=City of Coral Springs}}</ref>\n\n==Crime==\nThe city's historically low crime rate was marred in the early 1990s, when teen gang violence made headlines, with fights and murders reported.
