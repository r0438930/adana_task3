He spent 1976-1977 in the UK where he was greatly inspired by the birth of the UK [[Punk rock|punk]] scene. Soon after his return to the US he was recruited into seminal DC band, The Enzymes. Heavily inspired by such diverse influences as [[Sun Ra]], [[The Art Ensemble of Chicago]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] and [[Captain Beefheart]], the band existed at the fringes of what would eventually turn into [[DC Hardcore]]. After the appearance of the [[Bad Brains]] on the scene, the band became moved to a more conventionally punk and reggae repertoire. The Enzymes recorded a number of sessions but never releases any.\n\nIn 1982 he moved to Leeds to finish an undergraduate degree in Philosophy. While there he joined Dave Coleman aka Surfin Dave's surf/trash band. Originally called the Beany T's, the band was rechristened the Absent Legends. The band played a good deal in the UK and released one LP. ''In Search of a Decent Haircut'' on [[Crammed Discs]] in 1985. The Absent Legends disbanded the following year.\n\nDuring a return visit to Washington DC in the Summer of 1986, Haskett encountered longtime friend [[Henry Rollins]]. The two had been in regular contact since 1984 and often discussed musical collaboration. The serendipitous meeting turned into an improvised plan. DC bassist Bernie Wandel and Absent Legends drummer Mick Green were brought in as rhythm section and the result was the album ''[[Hot Animal Machine]]''.\n\nFrom 1987-1997, Haskett was the guitarist in the [[Rollins Band]]. The band racked up close to a thousand performances across the globe and were known for a high-intensity blend of raw energy and profound musicianship. In 1994 they were nominated for a Grammy and performed live at the ceremony. This incarnation broke up in 1998 after finishing their tour on the \"Come in and Burn\" album. Rollins kept the Rollins Band name with a new lineup of the band. The Rollins/Haskett/Cain/Gibbs lineup reformed briefly for the \"As the World Burns\" tour with Los Angeles rockers [[X (American band)|X]].\n\nPost-Rollins Band, Haskett has done multiple, mostly low-profile, projects. Throughout the 1990s he played his own instrumental compositions live with various bands. Inspired by both [[Sonny Sharrock]] and the [[Grateful Dead]], the instrumentation was usually guitar, bass, drums, drums.1995 saw his first solo release ''Language'' [https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Language/release/1591651], a mixture of angular, dense, difficult acoustic guitar (some in duet with ex-Birthday Party guitarist [[Rowland S. Howard]]) and [[musique concrete]]. In 1997 he released the CD ''\"[http://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Brandon-Finley-Non-Fiction/release/3455018 Nonfiction]\"'' in collaboration with [[Dog Eat Dog (band)|Dog Eat Dog]] drummer, Brandon Finley. The CD was a fusion of electric jazz and the [[go-go]] music that had been the soundtrack to his DC teen years. 2002 saw the release of \"[https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Not-Part-of-the-Solution/release/5468088]\" which showcased a more conventional approach to the electric guitar and allowed his debt to his heroes such as Zappa and Beck to show through. He reunited with Brandon Finley for 2011's ''Maybe Definitely'' [https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Brandon-Finley-Maybe-Definitely/release/3231837]\" (a play on Jeff Beck's title \"Definitely Maybe\") and another foray into the jazz/go-go territory the two explored on \"Nonfiction\". In 2014 he released ''The Courage Born of Conflicting Terrors'' [https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-The-Courage-Born-of-Conflicting-Terrors/release/6554932]\" in collaboration with Nick Enfield and Mirna Sodre.\n\nThere are three releases slated for 2017.\n\nOther past projects included collaborations with [[Reeves Gabrels]] at the end of the 1990s, the Preaching to the Perverted Tour with [[Pigface]], the [[Cassandra Complex]], [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]] (\"Blow tour 2001\"). He is also heard on the song \"If I'm Dreaming My Life\" on the [[David Bowie]] album ''[['hours...']]''.\n\nChris Haskett was one of the first \"indie\" guitarists to put [[Paul Reed Smith]] guitars in front of large audiences notably on the band's 1991 tour on the first [[Lollapalooza]]. His customized PRS CE24's, later combined with the original appearance of the  [[Mesa Boogie]] Dual Rectifier series became a staple of modern rock. More recently, his association with Paul Reed Smith resulted in a unique 9 string custom which has the lower E-A-D strings coursed for a 12-string sound but leaves the high G-B-E strings single to allow easier bends and solos.\n\nNow resident in the Netherlands, Haskett continues to record and tour.\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.chrishaskett.com/ ChrisHaskett.com]\n\n{{Pigface}}\n{{Rollins Band}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haskett, Chris}}\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:American rock guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:Pigface members]]\n[[Category:Alternative metal guitarists]]\n[[Category:Rollins Band members]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Thirsty Ear Recordings artists]]\n[[Category:Underground Inc. artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{BLP sources|date=May 2010}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Chris Haskett\n| image               = \n| image_size          = \n| landscape           = <!-- yes, if wide image, otherwise leave blank -->\n| alt                 = \n| caption             = \n| background          = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| birth_name          = \n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    =\n| alias               = \n| birth_date          = {{birth-date and age|1962}}\n| birth_place         = [[Washington, D.C.]]\n| origin              = \n| death_date          = <!-- {{death date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|YYYY|MM|DD}} (death date 1st) -->\n| death_place         = \n| genre               = \n| occupation          = \n| instrument          = [[Guitar]]\n| years_active        = <!-- YYYY\u2013YYYY (or \u2013present) -->\n| label               = [[Thirsty Ear Recordings|Thirsty Ear]], [[Underground Inc.]]\n| associated_acts     = [[David Bowie]], [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]], [[Pigface]], [[Rollins Band]], [[The Cassandra Complex (band)|The Cassandra Complex]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]]\n| website             = <!-- {{URL|example.com}} -->\n}}\n'''Chris Haskett''' (born 1962 in [[Washington, D.C.]]) is an American guitarist.
