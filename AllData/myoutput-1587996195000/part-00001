multiple TikTok incidents that resulted in users losing their lives or severely injuring themselves while filming. According to recent data from the ''\"TikTok Death Tracker\"'' website,<ref>{{cite web |title=TikTok Death Tracker |url=https://www.tiktokdeath.com/}}</ref> there have been 48 deaths and 23 injuries since 19 October 2018. The most common types of TikToks that led to these deaths and injuries included stunts, challenges, weapons, vehicles, and suicides. The country with the highest number of casualties is India. Other countries in the count include Australia, Pakistan, Canada, USA, Brazil, and Kuwait. The most recent death on 11 March 2020, took place in India where a TikTok craze caused a newly married man to be crushed by tractor while performing a stunt in hopes to gain fame on the app. Cyberbullying via the \u2018Comments\u2019 section in TikTok also tends to cause users to develop mental conditions that have resulted in self-harm. The first death recorded on 19 October 2018, was in India as well where a Chennai youth male committed suicide from a vehicle due to being bullied for dressing up as a woman in his TikTok videos. The \"TikTok Death Tracker\" website was created to promote awareness among people in society in order to ensure users are being safe when posting and viewing content. The TikTok company claims to have a secure and safe app if users follow the terms and conditions that appear on a user's screen when creating an account. The app discourages performing dangerous stunts or challenges. However, numerous participants become victimized under the influence of popular trends and completing viral challenges on the TikTok app. The TikTok creators developed a modification in the app's algorithm to have suggested hashtags with every uploaded video to promote a more safe and aware environment. Some content may not be allowed to be uploaded if deemed inappropriate or against the terms and conditions. This restriction helps protect others from viewing disturbing content while scrolling through the main page. &nbsp;\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |last1=Citarella |first1=Joshua |title=Adventures in TikTok, the Wildly Popular Video App Where Gen Z Rules |work=[[Artsy]] |date=3 December 2018 |url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-tiktok-wildly-popular-video-app-gen-rules |language=en |accessdate=5 December 2018  }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://www.douyin.com/ Douyin] {{in lang|zh}}\n\n{{Online social networking}}\n\n[[Category:TikTok]]\n[[Category:2016 software]]\n[[Category:Bytedance]]\n[[Category:Chinese brands]]\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2016]]\n[[Category:Mobile applications]]\n[[Category:Social networking services]]\n[[Category:Video hosting]]\n[[Category:Video software]]\n[[Category:Youth culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Tick tock (disambiguation){{!}}Tick tock}}\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Douyin|D\u014djin}}\n{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{split|Douyin|discuss=Talk:TikTok#Should_we_make_Douyin_a_separate_page?|date=March 2020}}\n{{short description|Video sharing application}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Infobox software\n| title = TikTok (Douyin \u6296\u97f3)\n| name = TikTok\n| logo = TikTok logo.svg\n| logo size = 220px\n| screenshot = TikTok app screenshot.png\n| screenshot size = 220\n| caption = A screenshot of the TikTok app, as seen in the United States.\n| collapsible = Yes\n| author = \n| developer = [[ByteDance]]\n| released = {{Start date and age|df=yes|2016|9}}.

multiple TikTok incidents that resulted in users losing their lives or severely injuring themselves while filming. According to recent data from the ''\"TikTok Death Tracker\"'' website,<ref>{{cite web |title=TikTok Death Tracker |url=https://www.tiktokdeath.com/}}</ref> there have been 48 deaths and 23 injuries since 19 October 2018. The most common types of TikToks that led to these deaths and injuries included stunts, challenges, weapons, vehicles, and suicides. The country with the highest number of casualties is India. Other countries in the count include Australia, Pakistan, Canada, USA, Brazil, and Kuwait. The most recent death on 11 March 2020, took place in India where a TikTok craze caused a newly married man to be crushed by tractor while performing a stunt in hopes to gain fame on the app. Cyberbullying via the \u2018Comments\u2019 section in TikTok also tends to cause users to develop mental conditions that have resulted in self-harm. The first death recorded on 19 October 2018, was in India as well where a Chennai youth male committed suicide from a vehicle due to being bullied for dressing up as a woman in his TikTok videos. The \"TikTok Death Tracker\" website was created to promote awareness among people in society in order to ensure users are being safe when posting and viewing content. The TikTok company claims to have a secure and safe app if users follow the terms and conditions that appear on a user's screen when creating an account. The app discourages performing dangerous stunts or challenges. However, numerous participants become victimized under the influence of popular trends and completing viral challenges on the TikTok app. The TikTok creators developed a modification in the app's algorithm to have suggested hashtags with every uploaded video to promote a more safe and aware environment. Some content may not be allowed to be uploaded if deemed inappropriate or against the terms and conditions. This restriction helps protect others from viewing disturbing content while scrolling through the main page. &nbsp;\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |last1=Citarella |first1=Joshua |title=Adventures in TikTok, the Wildly Popular Video App Where Gen Z Rules |work=[[Artsy]] |date=3 December 2018 |url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-tiktok-wildly-popular-video-app-gen-rules |language=en |accessdate=5 December 2018  }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://www.douyin.com/ Douyin] {{in lang|zh}}\n\n{{Online social networking}}\n\n[[Category:TikTok]]\n[[Category:2016 software]]\n[[Category:Bytedance]]\n[[Category:Chinese brands]]\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2016]]\n[[Category:Mobile applications]]\n[[Category:Social networking services]]\n[[Category:Video hosting]]\n[[Category:Video software]]\n[[Category:Youth culture]]\n", "name_user": "Soulbust", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUser privacy concerns", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok"}
