Some photo manipulations are considered skillful artwork while others are frowned upon as unethical practices, especially when used to deceive the public.  Other examples include being used for political [[propaganda]], or to make a product or person look better, or simply for entertainment purposes or harmless pranks.\n\nDepending on the application and intent, some photo manipulations are considered an [[art form]] because it involves the creation of unique images and in some instances, signature expressions of art by photographic artists.  For example, [[Ansel Adams]] employed some of the more common manipulations using [[Burning and dodging|darkroom exposure techniques]], burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.<ref name=Dziamba>{{cite web | url = https://whitherthebook.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/ansel-adams-and-photography-before-photoshop/ | title = Ansel Adams, and Photography Before Photoshop | author = Jack Dziamba | date = February 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite interview | title=Artbeat | date=November 29, 2012 | accessdate=January 30, 2016 | author=Mia Fineman | interviewer=Tom Legro | work=PBS Newshour | publisher=WPBT2 | location=South Florida | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/slide-show-what-did-we-do-before-photoshop/}}</ref>  Other examples of photo manipulation include retouching photographs using ink or paint, [[airbrushing]], [[double exposure (photography)|double exposure]], piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, scratching [[instant film]]s, or through the use of software-based manipulation tools applied to digital images.  There are a number of software applications available for digital image manipulation, ranging from professional applications to very basic imaging software for casual users.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ulysses_S._Grant_at_City_Point.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Ulysses S.

While the equipment and technology progressed over time, it was not until the late 20th century that photography evolved into the digital realm. At the onset, digital photography was considered by some to be a radical new approach and was initially rejected by photographers because of its substandard quality.<ref name=\"Peres\">{{cite book|last=Peres|first=Michael|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Fourth Edition|year=2007|publisher=Focal Press; 4 edition|isbn=978-0-240-80740-9|page= Preface, 24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyldcYfq3MC&pg=PR23#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}</ref> The transition from film to digital has been an ongoing process although great strides were made in the early 21st century as a result of [[innovation]] that has greatly improved digital image quality while reducing the bulk and weight of cameras and equipment.<ref name=Adobe>{{cite web | url = https://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_filmtodig.pdf | publisher = Adobe Systems Incorporated | title = Making The Transition From Film To Digital |author-first=Michael |author-last=Reichmann |author-link=Michael Reichmann | date = 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Early===\nAn early example of tampering was in the early 1860s, when a photo was altered using the body from a portrait of [[John C.

For example, Grant's head is set at a strange angle to his body, his uniform is of a different time period, and his favorite horse [[Cincinnati (horse)|Cincinnati]] did not have a left hind sock like the horse in the photograph, although his other horse Egypt did have a sock but on a different foot. With further research, three different photographs were discovered that explained the composite using Grant's head from one photograph, the body of [[Alexander McDowell McCook|Major General Alexander McDowell McCook]] atop his horse from another photograph, and for the background, and 1864 photograph of [[Confederate Army of the Shenandoah|Confederate prisoners]] captured at the [[Battle of Fisher's Hill]].<ref name=LOC/> Queen Victoria herself once scratched out her own face on the negative of a family picture made in 1852, as she found herself 'horrid' looking.

Shortly after the incident, Tom Kennedy, director of photography for ''National Geographic'' stated,  \"We no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect. We regarded that afterwards as a mistake, and we wouldn\u2019t repeat that mistake today.\"<ref name=BRONXDOC/>\n\nThere are other incidents of questionable photo manipulation in journalism.  One such incident arose in early 2005 after [[Martha Stewart]] was released from prison. ''[[Newsweek]]'' used a photograph of Stewart's face on the body of a much slimmer woman for their cover, suggesting that Stewart had lost weight while in prison.<ref name= NYT2005>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/business/media/martha-stewart-gets-new-body-in-newsweek.html?_r=0 | title = Martha Stewart Gets New Body In Newsweek | work=New York Times | author =  Jonathan D.

The image in question was a fraudulent composite image of [[John Kerry]] taken on June 13, 1971 and [[Jane Fonda]] taken in August, 1972 sharing the same platform at a 1971 antiwar rally; the latter of which carried a fake [[Associated Press]] credit with the intent to change the public's perspective of reality.<ref name=\"IntlNYT2004\"/>\n\nThere is a growing body of writings devoted to the ethical use of digital editing in [[photojournalism]]. In the United States, for example, the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) established a Code of Ethics which promotes the accuracy of published images, advising that photographers \"do not manipulate images [...] that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics | title = NPPA Code of Ethics | date = January 28, 2017 | publisher=[[National Press Photographers Association]]}}</ref> Infringements of the Code are taken very seriously, especially regarding digital alteration of published photographs, as evidenced by a case in which [[Pulitzer prize]]-nominated photographer [[Allan Detrich]] resigned his post following the revelation that a number of his photographs had been manipulated.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571795 | title = Blade Editor: Detrich Submitted 79 Altered Photos This Year | work=[[Photo District News]] | date = April 15, 2007 | first = Daryl | last = Lang}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a Ukrainian photographer Stepan Rudik, winner of the 3rd prize story in Sports Features, has been disqualified due to violation of the rules of the [[World Press Photo of the Year|World Press Photo]] contest. \"After requesting [[Raw image format|RAW-files]] of the series from him, it became clear that an element had been removed from one of the original photographs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Announcement of disqualification|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/news/2010-03-03/announcement-disqualification|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> As of 2015, up to 20%<ref>{{Cite web|title = World Press Photo Organizer: 20% of Finalists Disqualified|url = http://time.com/3706626/world-press-photo-processing-manipulation-disqualified/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> of World Press Photo entries that made it to the penultimate round of the contest were disqualified after they were found to have been manipulated or post-processed with rules violations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What counts as manipulation?|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/activities/photo-contest/verification-process/what-counts-as-manipulation|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in fashion ===\nThe photo manipulation industry has often been accused of promoting or inciting a distorted and unrealistic image of self; most specifically in younger people. The world of [[glamour photography]] is one specific industry which has been heavily involved with the use of photo manipulation (what many consider to be a concerning element as many people look up to celebrities in search of embodying the 'ideal figure').<ref name=photo/>  Manipulation of a photo to alter a model's appearance can be used to change features such as skin complexion, hair color, body shape, and other features.  Many of the alterations to skin involve removing blemishes through the use of the healing tool in Photoshop.  Photo editors may also alter the color of hair to remove roots or add shine.  Additionally, the model's teeth and eyes may be made to look whiter than they are in reality. [[Cosmetics|Make up]] and [[body piercing|piercings]] can even be edited into pictures to look as though the model was wearing them when the photo was taken.  Through photo editing, the appearance of a model may be drastically changed to mask imperfections.<ref>Metzmacher, Dirk. \"Smashing Magazine.\" Smashing Magazine. N.p., n.d. Web.

Reverse retouching is just as common as making models skinnier, \u201cdistorting the bodies of very thin models to make them appear more robust in a process called reverse retouching. It is almost worse than making someone slimmer because the image claims you can be at an unhealthy weight but still look healthy. In reality, you can't, you have to Photoshop it\".<ref name=\"Cage\"/>  Reverse retouching includes eliminating shadows from protruding bones, adding flesh over body parts, color correcting, and removing hair generated for warmth from extreme weight loss. Professionals are saying that if an image is not labeled \"not retouched,\" then the public can assume that photograph has been modified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-retouched-photos-impact-our-mental-health-2018-3|title=Here's how retouched photos impact our mental health|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref> As the fashion industry continues to use photos that have been manipulated to idealize body types, there is a need for education about how unreal and unhealthy these images are and the negative implications they are promoting.\n\nA photoshop expert, who edited and altered a lot of images for the fashion industry and wants to remain private, says it's normal to photoshop a model thinner and it doesn't matter how thick or thin the model is. They usually edit away up to 10 kilo's. But in the past 20 years, the practice has changed as more celebrities are on social media and the public is now used to how they look. You can't alter their bodies or faces too much as the public will notice that. The retoucher notes that the industry is made for making a lot of dollars in advertising and that the unrealistic ideals cycle will continue as they have to maintain this. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/photoshop-shock-insider-reveals-fashion-industry-image-editing-practices-20140924-10l97y.html|title=Photoshop shock: Insider reveals fashion industry image editing practices|last=Clun|first=Rachel|date=2014-09-24|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nSince 2012, Seventeen Magazine has let the public know that they stopped photoshopping their models.

With social media users and the younger generation being exposed to an extreme amount of imagery that has been manipulated the consequences have a negative impact as body ideals are unachievable.  Social media has the opportunity to be used as a platform for promoting healthy body image and unedited photos; the need for approval over social media has to be altered in the near future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nApps like Facetune are used a lot by celebrities and influencers on social media. An example is Khloe Kardashian. It was the bestselling app for Apple in 2017 and it sold around 10 million times copies. Facetune 2 is an upgrade of the original version and has more features like live editing. With live editing it means you can edit your camera before you take a picture. Normally you would edit a picture after you have taken it, but now you can do it before and alter yourself to your liking. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Solon|first=Olivia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate|title=FaceTune is conquering Instagram \u2013 but does it take airbrushing too far?|date=2018-03-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== In advertising ===\nPhoto manipulation is not only used by fashion magazines, celebrities and influencers, it's also used in advertisement for Tv commercials and magazines. They use this to make their products or the person look better and more appealing than how they look in reality. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/the-problem-with-photo-manipulation/1/|title=Digital Media Literacy: The Problem with Photo Manipulation|website=GCFGlobal.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A few tricks that are used with photo manipulation for advertising are: fake grill marks with eye-liner, instead of milk use white glue, to make vegetables look glossy use deodorant, ice-cream melts quick so they use masked potato's. In food photographs we see for example a perfect looking burger, with bright colours. But in reality when you receive the burger, it's very sad looking. But as consumers we accept this, we find it normal that the burger we buy is not the same as in the picture. When a consumer buys a laptop, it's the same one as in the picture. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trulydeeply.com.au/2015/11/food-photography-and-manipulation-in-advertising-why-do-we-accept-knowingly-being-lied-to/|title=Food photography and manipulation in advertising: Why do we accept knowingly being lied to?|date=2015-11-19|website=Truly Deeply - Brand Agency Melbourne|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Celebrity opposition===\nPhoto manipulation has triggered negative responses from both viewers and celebrities.

To show how much influence cyberbullying can have on somebodies body image, she edited herself in her videos she posted on her social media. The videos went viral. Cassey also looked for the 100 most-followed influencers, who are female, and noted 22 physical attributes. She classified these as 'Instagram beauty standard'. Examples of these beauty standards are a flat stomach and filled lips. After looking it up and classifying these standards, Cassey applied them to her own pictures and photoshopped them. To make sure her followers on Instagram get more aware about these Instagram beauty standards, she posted the before-and-after and that not everything on Instagram is what it seems to be. Not everybody reacted positive on Cassey's revelation. Some found that she pushed the talent of the influencers and celebrities aside while analyzing these pictures. They also claimed she focused too much on their appearance. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/influencer-instagram-photoshop-beauty-standards-2019-9|title=A fitness influencer Photoshopped herself to meet the beauty standards of Instagram's most-followed women to prove social media isn't real life|last=Schild|first=Darcy|website=Insider|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Corporate opposition===\nMultiple companies have begun taking the initiative to speak out against the use of photo manipulation when advertising their products. Two companies that have done so include [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]. Dove created the Dove Self-Esteem Fund and also the [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]] as a way to try to help build confidence in young women. They want to emphasize what is known as real beauty, or untouched photographs, in the media now.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Evolution Video \u2013 Dove Self Esteem Project|website=selfesteem.dove.us|date= 2 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://selfesteem.dove.us/Articles/Video/Evolution_video_how_images_of_beauty_are_manipulated_by_the_media.aspx}}</ref> Also, Aerie has started their campaign #AerieREAL.

Dr. McAneny made a statement that altering models to such extremes creates unrealistic expectations in children and teenagers regarding body image. He also said that we should stop altering the models so they are not exposed to body types that can be attained only through the use of editing the photos. The American Medical Associations as a whole adopted a policy to work with advertisers to work on setting up guidelines for advertisements to try to limit how much photoshop is used. The goal of this policy is to limit the amount of unrealistic expectations for body image in advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|title=AMA Adopts New Policies at Annual Meeting|date=21 June 2011|website=ama-assn.org|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/a11-new-policies.page}}</ref>\n\n=== Government opposition ===\nGovernments are exerting pressure on advertisers, and are starting to ban photos that are too airbrushed and edited. In the United Kingdom the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has banned an advertisement by [[Lanc\u00f4me]] featuring [[Julia Roberts]] for being misleading, stating that the flawless skin seen in the photo was too good to be true.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Michael|title=Julia Roberts Makeup Ads Banned in UK for Too Much Photoshop|url=http://www.petapixel.com/2011/07/27/julia-roberts-makeup-ads-banned-in-uk-for-too-much-photoshop/|publisher=PetaPixel|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>  The US is also moving in the direction of banning excessive photo manipulation where a [[CoverGirl]] model's ad was banned because it had exaggerated effects, leading to a misleading representation of the product.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=US watchdog bans photoshopping in cosmetics ads|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/109375-us-bans-photoshop-use-in-cosmetics-ads|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, France proceeded to pass a law that battles against the use of unrealistic body images and anorexia in the fashion industry. This includes modeling and photography. The models now have to show they are healthy and have a BMI of over 18 through a note from their doctor. Employers who don't attain to this law will be fined and can serve a jail sentence up to 6 months. When a creator of a photograph does not disclose that the picture is edited or retouched, no matter how small the edit, they also can get a fine or 30% of the costs of what they used to create their ad. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petapixel.com/2015/12/22/france-bans-too-thin-fashion-models-demands-that-photoshopping-be-labeled/|title=France Bans Too-Thin Fashion Models, Demands That Photoshopping Be Labeled|website=petapixel.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Support===\nSome editors of magazine companies do not view manipulating their [[cover model]]s as an issue. In an interview with the editor of the French magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', she stated that their readers are not idiots and that they can tell when a model has been retouched. Also, some who support photo manipulation in the media state that the altered photographs are not the issue, but that it is the expectations that viewers have that they fail to meet, such as wanting to have the same body as a celebrity on the cover of their favorite magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Defense of Photoshop: Why Retouching Isn't As Evil As Everyone Thinks|work= The Cut|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2010/08/photoshop_retouching.html}}</ref>\n\n===Opinion polling===\nSurveys have been done to see how photo manipulation affects society and to see what society thinks of it. One survey was done by a fashion store in the United Kingdom, [[New Look (company)|New Look]], and it showed that 90% of the individuals surveyed would prefer seeing a wider variety of body shapes in media. This would involve them wanting to see cover models that are not all thin, but some with more curves than others. The survey also talked about how readers view the use of photo manipulation. One statistic stated that 15% of the readers believed that the cover images are accurate depictions of the model in reality. Also, they found that 33% of women who were surveyed are aiming for a body that is impossible for them to attain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women Need Further Educating Into Extent of Digital Manipulation of Mo|website=prweb.com|date= 26 November 2013|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/11/prweb11361783.htm}}</ref>\n\nDove also did a survey to see how photo manipulation affects the self-esteem of females. In doing this, they found that 80% of the women surveyed felt insecure when seeing photos of celebrities in the media. Of the women surveyed who had lower self-esteem, 71% of them do not believe that their appearance is pretty or stylish enough in comparison to cover models.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Self Esteem Act: Parents Push for Anti-Photoshop Law in U.S. to Protect Teens from Unrealistic Body Image Ideals|publisher=Daily Mail Online|work=Associated Newspapers|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2048375/Self-Esteem-Act-US-parents-push-anti-Photoshop-laws-advertising.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Social and cultural implications ===\n\nThe growing popularity of image manipulation has raised concern as to whether it allows for unrealistic images to be portrayed to the public. In her article \"[[On Photography]]\" (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] discusses the objectivity, or lack thereof, in photography, concluding that \"photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored and tricked out\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Sontag | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Sontag | year = 1977 | title = [[On Photography]] | page = 4}}</ref>  A practice widely used in the magazine industry, the use of photo manipulation on an already subjective photograph, creates a constructed reality for the individual and it can become difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. With the potential to alter body image, debate continues as to whether manipulated images, particularly those in magazines, contribute to self-esteem issues in both men and women.\n\nIn today's world, photo manipulation has a positive impact by developing the creativity of one's mind or maybe a negative one by removing the art and beauty of capturing something so magnificent and natural or the way it should be. According to ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', \"Photoshopping and airbrushing, many believe, are now an inherent part of the beauty industry, as are makeup, lighting and styling\".  In a way, these image alterations are \"selling\" actual people to the masses to affect responses, reactions, and emotions toward these cultural icons.<ref>{{cite web|last=L.

In September 2019, around 15.000 deepfake videos were found online by a firm named Deeptrace. In those videos, 99% were faces used from female celebrities and put on the body's of porn stars. This new technique is used with just a couple of photos and will be used as revenge porn by anybody, not just by celebreties. A professor of law named Danielle Citron says: 'Deepfake technology is being weaponised against women.' Deepfake looks realistic even when it's made completely from fictional photos. It can also manipulate voices and let somebody say something they would never say. That makes it also very convincing. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Sample|first=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them|title=What are deepfakes \u2013 and how can you spot them?|date=2020-01-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==\"Photoshop\" as a verb==\n<!--[[Adobe Photoshop#Cultural impact]] links to this section via {{further}}.

Some photo manipulations are considered skillful artwork while others are frowned upon as unethical practices, especially when used to deceive the public.  Other examples include being used for political [[propaganda]], or to make a product or person look better, or simply for entertainment purposes or harmless pranks.\n\nDepending on the application and intent, some photo manipulations are considered an [[art form]] because it involves the creation of unique images and in some instances, signature expressions of art by photographic artists.  For example, [[Ansel Adams]] employed some of the more common manipulations using [[Burning and dodging|darkroom exposure techniques]], burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.<ref name=Dziamba>{{cite web | url = https://whitherthebook.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/ansel-adams-and-photography-before-photoshop/ | title = Ansel Adams, and Photography Before Photoshop | author = Jack Dziamba | date = February 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite interview | title=Artbeat | date=November 29, 2012 | accessdate=January 30, 2016 | author=Mia Fineman | interviewer=Tom Legro | work=PBS Newshour | publisher=WPBT2 | location=South Florida | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/slide-show-what-did-we-do-before-photoshop/}}</ref>  Other examples of photo manipulation include retouching photographs using ink or paint, [[airbrushing]], [[double exposure (photography)|double exposure]], piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, scratching [[instant film]]s, or through the use of software-based manipulation tools applied to digital images.  There are a number of software applications available for digital image manipulation, ranging from professional applications to very basic imaging software for casual users.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ulysses_S._Grant_at_City_Point.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Ulysses S.

While the equipment and technology progressed over time, it was not until the late 20th century that photography evolved into the digital realm. At the onset, digital photography was considered by some to be a radical new approach and was initially rejected by photographers because of its substandard quality.<ref name=\"Peres\">{{cite book|last=Peres|first=Michael|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Fourth Edition|year=2007|publisher=Focal Press; 4 edition|isbn=978-0-240-80740-9|page= Preface, 24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyldcYfq3MC&pg=PR23#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}</ref> The transition from film to digital has been an ongoing process although great strides were made in the early 21st century as a result of [[innovation]] that has greatly improved digital image quality while reducing the bulk and weight of cameras and equipment.<ref name=Adobe>{{cite web | url = https://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_filmtodig.pdf | publisher = Adobe Systems Incorporated | title = Making The Transition From Film To Digital |author-first=Michael |author-last=Reichmann |author-link=Michael Reichmann | date = 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Early===\nAn early example of tampering was in the early 1860s, when a photo was altered using the body from a portrait of [[John C.

Shortly after the incident, Tom Kennedy, director of photography for ''National Geographic'' stated,  \"We no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect. We regarded that afterwards as a mistake, and we wouldn\u2019t repeat that mistake today.\"<ref name=BRONXDOC/>\n\nThere are other incidents of questionable photo manipulation in journalism.  One such incident arose in early 2005 after [[Martha Stewart]] was released from prison. ''[[Newsweek]]'' used a photograph of Stewart's face on the body of a much slimmer woman for their cover, suggesting that Stewart had lost weight while in prison.<ref name= NYT2005>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/business/media/martha-stewart-gets-new-body-in-newsweek.html?_r=0 | title = Martha Stewart Gets New Body In Newsweek | work=New York Times | author =  Jonathan D.

The image in question was a fraudulent composite image of [[John Kerry]] taken on June 13, 1971 and [[Jane Fonda]] taken in August, 1972 sharing the same platform at a 1971 antiwar rally; the latter of which carried a fake [[Associated Press]] credit with the intent to change the public's perspective of reality.<ref name=\"IntlNYT2004\"/>\n\nThere is a growing body of writings devoted to the ethical use of digital editing in [[photojournalism]]. In the United States, for example, the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) established a Code of Ethics which promotes the accuracy of published images, advising that photographers \"do not manipulate images [...] that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics | title = NPPA Code of Ethics | date = January 28, 2017 | publisher=[[National Press Photographers Association]]}}</ref> Infringements of the Code are taken very seriously, especially regarding digital alteration of published photographs, as evidenced by a case in which [[Pulitzer prize]]-nominated photographer [[Allan Detrich]] resigned his post following the revelation that a number of his photographs had been manipulated.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571795 | title = Blade Editor: Detrich Submitted 79 Altered Photos This Year | work=[[Photo District News]] | date = April 15, 2007 | first = Daryl | last = Lang}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a Ukrainian photographer Stepan Rudik, winner of the 3rd prize story in Sports Features, has been disqualified due to violation of the rules of the [[World Press Photo of the Year|World Press Photo]] contest. \"After requesting [[Raw image format|RAW-files]] of the series from him, it became clear that an element had been removed from one of the original photographs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Announcement of disqualification|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/news/2010-03-03/announcement-disqualification|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> As of 2015, up to 20%<ref>{{Cite web|title = World Press Photo Organizer: 20% of Finalists Disqualified|url = http://time.com/3706626/world-press-photo-processing-manipulation-disqualified/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> of World Press Photo entries that made it to the penultimate round of the contest were disqualified after they were found to have been manipulated or post-processed with rules violations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What counts as manipulation?|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/activities/photo-contest/verification-process/what-counts-as-manipulation|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in fashion ===\nThe photo manipulation industry has often been accused of promoting or inciting a distorted and unrealistic image of self; most specifically in younger people. The world of [[glamour photography]] is one specific industry which has been heavily involved with the use of photo manipulation (what many consider to be a concerning element as many people look up to celebrities in search of embodying the 'ideal figure').<ref name=photo/>  Manipulation of a photo to alter a model's appearance can be used to change features such as skin complexion, hair color, body shape, and other features.  Many of the alterations to skin involve removing blemishes through the use of the healing tool in Photoshop.  Photo editors may also alter the color of hair to remove roots or add shine.  Additionally, the model's teeth and eyes may be made to look whiter than they are in reality. [[Cosmetics|Make up]] and [[body piercing|piercings]] can even be edited into pictures to look as though the model was wearing them when the photo was taken.  Through photo editing, the appearance of a model may be drastically changed to mask imperfections.<ref>Metzmacher, Dirk. \"Smashing Magazine.\" Smashing Magazine. N.p., n.d. Web.

Reverse retouching is just as common as making models skinnier, \u201cdistorting the bodies of very thin models to make them appear more robust in a process called reverse retouching. It is almost worse than making someone slimmer because the image claims you can be at an unhealthy weight but still look healthy. In reality, you can't, you have to Photoshop it\".<ref name=\"Cage\"/>  Reverse retouching includes eliminating shadows from protruding bones, adding flesh over body parts, color correcting, and removing hair generated for warmth from extreme weight loss. Professionals are saying that if an image is not labeled \"not retouched,\" then the public can assume that photograph has been modified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-retouched-photos-impact-our-mental-health-2018-3|title=Here's how retouched photos impact our mental health|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref> As the fashion industry continues to use photos that have been manipulated to idealize body types, there is a need for education about how unreal and unhealthy these images are and the negative implications they are promoting.\n\nA photoshop expert, who edited and altered a lot of images for the fashion industry and wants to remain private, says it's normal to photoshop a model thinner and it doesn't matter how thick or thin the model is. They usually edit away up to 10 kilo's. But in the past 20 years, the practice has changed as more celebrities are on social media and the public is now used to how they look. You can't alter their bodies or faces too much as the public will notice that. The retoucher notes that the industry is made for making a lot of dollars in advertising and that the unrealistic ideals cycle will continue as they have to maintain this. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/photoshop-shock-insider-reveals-fashion-industry-image-editing-practices-20140924-10l97y.html|title=Photoshop shock: Insider reveals fashion industry image editing practices|last=Clun|first=Rachel|date=2014-09-24|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nSince 2012, Seventeen Magazine has let the public know that they stopped photoshopping their models.

Social media has the opportunity to be used as a platform for promoting healthy body image and unedited photos; the need for approval over social media has to be altered in the near future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nApps like Facetune are used a lot by celebrities and influencers on social media. An example is Khloe Kardashian. It was the bestselling app for Apple in 2017 and it sold around 10 million times copies. Facetune 2 is an upgrade of the original version and has more features like live editing. With live editing it means you can edit your camera before you take a picture. Normally you would edit a picture after you have taken it, but now you can do it before and alter yourself to your liking. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Solon|first=Olivia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate|title=FaceTune is conquering Instagram \u2013 but does it take airbrushing too far?|date=2018-03-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== In advertising ===\nPhoto manipulation is not only used by fashion magazines, celebrities and influencers, it's also used in advertisement for Tv commercials and magazines. They use this to make their products or the person look better and more appealing than how they look in reality. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/the-problem-with-photo-manipulation/1/|title=Digital Media Literacy: The Problem with Photo Manipulation|website=GCFGlobal.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A few tricks that are used with photo manipulation for advertising are: fake grill marks with eye-liner, instead of milk use white glue, to make vegetables look glossy use deodorant, ice-cream melts quick so they use masked potato's. In food photographs we see for example a perfect looking burger, with bright colours. But in reality when you receive the burger, it's very sad looking. But as consumers we accept this, we find it normal that the burger we buy is not the same as in the picture. When a consumer buys a laptop, it's the same one as in the picture. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trulydeeply.com.au/2015/11/food-photography-and-manipulation-in-advertising-why-do-we-accept-knowingly-being-lied-to/|title=Food photography and manipulation in advertising: Why do we accept knowingly being lied to?|date=2015-11-19|website=Truly Deeply - Brand Agency Melbourne|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Celebrity opposition===\nPhoto manipulation has triggered negative responses from both viewers and celebrities.

To show how much influence cyberbullying can have on somebodies body image, she edited herself in her videos she posted on her social media. The videos went viral. Cassey also looked for the 100 most-followed influencers, who are female, and noted 22 physical attributes. She classified these as 'Instagram beauty standard'. Examples of these beauty standards are a flat stomach and filled lips. After looking it up and classifying these standards, Cassey applied them to her own pictures and photoshopped them. To make sure her followers on Instagram get more aware about these Instagram beauty standards, she posted the before-and-after and that not everything on Instagram is what it seems to be. Not everybody reacted positive on Cassey's revelation. Some found that she pushed the talent of the influencers and celebrities aside while analyzing these pictures. They also claimed she focused too much on their appearance. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/influencer-instagram-photoshop-beauty-standards-2019-9|title=A fitness influencer Photoshopped herself to meet the beauty standards of Instagram's most-followed women to prove social media isn't real life|last=Schild|first=Darcy|website=Insider|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Corporate opposition===\nMultiple companies have begun taking the initiative to speak out against the use of photo manipulation when advertising their products. Two companies that have done so include [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]. Dove created the Dove Self-Esteem Fund and also the [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]] as a way to try to help build confidence in young women. They want to emphasize what is known as real beauty, or untouched photographs, in the media now.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Evolution Video \u2013 Dove Self Esteem Project|website=selfesteem.dove.us|date= 2 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://selfesteem.dove.us/Articles/Video/Evolution_video_how_images_of_beauty_are_manipulated_by_the_media.aspx}}</ref> Also, Aerie has started their campaign #AerieREAL.

They also add in their advertisements that \"The real you is sexy.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Krupnick|first=Ellie|title=Aerie's Unretouched Ads 'Challenge Supermodel Standards' For Young Women|newspaper= The Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/aerie-unretouched-ads-photos_n_4618139.html}}</ref>\n\nAlso, the American Medical Association has taken a stand against the use of photo manipulation. Dr. McAneny made a statement that altering models to such extremes creates unrealistic expectations in children and teenagers regarding body image. He also said that we should stop altering the models so they are not exposed to body types that can be attained only through the use of editing the photos. The American Medical Associations as a whole adopted a policy to work with advertisers to work on setting up guidelines for advertisements to try to limit how much photoshop is used. The goal of this policy is to limit the amount of unrealistic expectations for body image in advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|title=AMA Adopts New Policies at Annual Meeting|date=21 June 2011|website=ama-assn.org|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/a11-new-policies.page}}</ref>\n\n=== Government opposition ===\nGovernments are exerting pressure on advertisers, and are starting to ban photos that are too airbrushed and edited. In the United Kingdom the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has banned an advertisement by [[Lanc\u00f4me]] featuring [[Julia Roberts]] for being misleading, stating that the flawless skin seen in the photo was too good to be true.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Michael|title=Julia Roberts Makeup Ads Banned in UK for Too Much Photoshop|url=http://www.petapixel.com/2011/07/27/julia-roberts-makeup-ads-banned-in-uk-for-too-much-photoshop/|publisher=PetaPixel|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>  The US is also moving in the direction of banning excessive photo manipulation where a [[CoverGirl]] model's ad was banned because it had exaggerated effects, leading to a misleading representation of the product.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=US watchdog bans photoshopping in cosmetics ads|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/109375-us-bans-photoshop-use-in-cosmetics-ads|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, France proceeded to pass a law that battles against the use of unrealistic body images and anorexia in the fashion industry. This includes modeling and photography. The models now have to show they are healthy and have a BMI of over 18 through a note from their doctor. Employers who don't attain to this law will be fined and can serve a jail sentence up to 6 months. When a creator of a photograph does not disclose that the picture is edited or retouched, no matter how small the edit, they also can get a fine or 30% of the costs of what they used to create their ad. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petapixel.com/2015/12/22/france-bans-too-thin-fashion-models-demands-that-photoshopping-be-labeled/|title=France Bans Too-Thin Fashion Models, Demands That Photoshopping Be Labeled|website=petapixel.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Support===\nSome editors of magazine companies do not view manipulating their [[cover model]]s as an issue. In an interview with the editor of the French magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', she stated that their readers are not idiots and that they can tell when a model has been retouched. Also, some who support photo manipulation in the media state that the altered photographs are not the issue, but that it is the expectations that viewers have that they fail to meet, such as wanting to have the same body as a celebrity on the cover of their favorite magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Defense of Photoshop: Why Retouching Isn't As Evil As Everyone Thinks|work= The Cut|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2010/08/photoshop_retouching.html}}</ref>\n\n===Opinion polling===\nSurveys have been done to see how photo manipulation affects society and to see what society thinks of it. One survey was done by a fashion store in the United Kingdom, [[New Look (company)|New Look]], and it showed that 90% of the individuals surveyed would prefer seeing a wider variety of body shapes in media. This would involve them wanting to see cover models that are not all thin, but some with more curves than others. The survey also talked about how readers view the use of photo manipulation. One statistic stated that 15% of the readers believed that the cover images are accurate depictions of the model in reality. Also, they found that 33% of women who were surveyed are aiming for a body that is impossible for them to attain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women Need Further Educating Into Extent of Digital Manipulation of Mo|website=prweb.com|date= 26 November 2013|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/11/prweb11361783.htm}}</ref>\n\nDove also did a survey to see how photo manipulation affects the self-esteem of females. In doing this, they found that 80% of the women surveyed felt insecure when seeing photos of celebrities in the media. Of the women surveyed who had lower self-esteem, 71% of them do not believe that their appearance is pretty or stylish enough in comparison to cover models.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Self Esteem Act: Parents Push for Anti-Photoshop Law in U.S. to Protect Teens from Unrealistic Body Image Ideals|publisher=Daily Mail Online|work=Associated Newspapers|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2048375/Self-Esteem-Act-US-parents-push-anti-Photoshop-laws-advertising.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Social and cultural implications ===\n\nThe growing popularity of image manipulation has raised concern as to whether it allows for unrealistic images to be portrayed to the public. In her article \"[[On Photography]]\" (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] discusses the objectivity, or lack thereof, in photography, concluding that \"photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored and tricked out\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Sontag | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Sontag | year = 1977 | title = [[On Photography]] | page = 4}}</ref>  A practice widely used in the magazine industry, the use of photo manipulation on an already subjective photograph, creates a constructed reality for the individual and it can become difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. With the potential to alter body image, debate continues as to whether manipulated images, particularly those in magazines, contribute to self-esteem issues in both men and women.\n\nIn today's world, photo manipulation has a positive impact by developing the creativity of one's mind or maybe a negative one by removing the art and beauty of capturing something so magnificent and natural or the way it should be. According to ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', \"Photoshopping and airbrushing, many believe, are now an inherent part of the beauty industry, as are makeup, lighting and styling\".  In a way, these image alterations are \"selling\" actual people to the masses to affect responses, reactions, and emotions toward these cultural icons.<ref>{{cite web|last=L.

In September 2019, around 15.000 deepfake videos were found online by a firm named Deeptrace. In those videos, 99% were faces used from female celebrities and put on the body's of porn stars. This new technique is used with just a couple of photos and will be used as revenge porn by anybody, not just by celebreties. A professor of law named Danielle Citron says: 'Deepfake technology is being weaponised against women.' Deepfake looks realistic even when it's made completely from fictional photos. It can also manipulate voices and let somebody say something they would never say. That makes it also very convincing. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Sample|first=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them|title=What are deepfakes \u2013 and how can you spot them?|date=2020-01-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==\"Photoshop\" as a verb==\n<!--[[Adobe Photoshop#Cultural impact]] links to this section via {{further}}.
