the overthrow of [[King Zahir Shah]] by his distant cousin [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] in a bloodless [[1973 Afghan coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, [[emancipation]] of women, and [[Pashtun nationalism]]. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] began to encourage Afghan [[Islamist]] leaders such as [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in [[Saur Revolution|a coup by Afghan's Communist Party]], his former partner in government, known as the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|title=Mohammad Daud Khan|date=2000|website=Afghanland.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817040633/http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|archive-date=17 August 2017|url-status=|access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref> The PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition across rural areas. The PDPA's crackdown was met with open rebellion, including [[Ismail Khan]]'s [[1979 Herat Uprising|Herat Uprising]]. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on 11 September 1979 when [[Hafizullah Amin]] ousted [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]. The [[Soviet Union]], sensing PDPA weakness, [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened militarily three months later]], [[Operation Storm-333|to depose Amin]] and install [[Parcham|another PDA faction]] led by [[Babrak Karmal]].\n\nThe entry of Soviet forces in Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its [[Cold War]] rivals, the United States, Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[China]] to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated [[mujahideen]] held sway in much of the countryside. Besides Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]]. The [[CIA]] worked closely with Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"[[Afghan Arabs]]\", including [[Osama bin Laden]].\n\nAfter the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan]] in May 1989, the PDPA regime under [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] held on until 1992, when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] cleared the approach to [[Kabul]]. With the political stage cleared of socialists, the warlords, some of them Islamist, vied for power. By then, Bin Laden had left the country and the United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished.\n\n===Warlord rule (1992\u20131996)===\n{{Main|Afghan Civil War (1992\u201396)}}\n[[File:Massoud and Qadir 2.PNG|thumb|[[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] (right) with Pashtun anti-Taliban leader and later Vice-President of the [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]]]\n\nIn 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul.

He had founded Al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to support the Mujahideen's war against the Soviets but became disillusioned by infighting among warlords. He grew close to Mullah Omar and moved Al-Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[9/11 Commission]] in the US found that under the Taliban, al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other [[jihadist]]s, and plot terrorist actions.{{sfn|911 Commission|2004|p=66}} While al-Qaeda maintained its own [[Afghan training camp|camps in Afghanistan]], it also supported training camps of other organizations. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front.

US officials pressed the Taliban to surrender bin Laden. In 1999, the international community imposed sanctions on the Taliban, calling for bin Laden to be surrendered. The Taliban repeatedly rebuffed these demands.\n\n[[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama bin Laden.

Massoud responded that, as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat, he would continue to defend it from the Taliban.<ref name=\"Webster University Press Book\" /> Around the same time, top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to try to persuade the United Front not to take advantage of a chance to make crucial gains against the Taliban.

The report emphasizes the rise of \"complex attacks\", a type of suicide assault that is becoming more deadly, described by the New York Times as the hallmark of the war in 2018. These attacks are referred to as the Taliban's ferocious response to US President Trump's new strategy of war (an increased pace of aerial bombardments targeting Taliban and Islamic State Militants), giving the message that the Taliban can strike at will, even in the capital city, Kabul. The U.N. report included a statement showing the Taliban's position, the Taliban blamed the U.S and its allies for fighting the war in Afghanistan, and it denied targeting civilians. The New York Times quoted Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired general and military analyst based in Kabul, saying that the UN report proved the failure of peace talks, as the Taliban and the US government are both determined for victory rather than negotiating a settlement. He said \"More airstrikes mean more suicide attacks,\" proving the intensification of the war by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-casualties.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAfghanistan&action=click&contentCollection=world&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection|title=More Afghan Civilians Being Deliberately Targeted, U.N.

the overthrow of [[King Zahir Shah]] by his distant cousin [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] in a bloodless [[1973 Afghan coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, [[emancipation]] of women, and [[Pashtun nationalism]]. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] began to encourage Afghan [[Islamist]] leaders such as [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in [[Saur Revolution|a coup by Afghan's Communist Party]], his former partner in government, known as the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|title=Mohammad Daud Khan|date=2000|website=Afghanland.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817040633/http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|archive-date=17 August 2017|url-status=|access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref> The PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition across rural areas. The PDPA's crackdown was met with open rebellion, including [[Ismail Khan]]'s [[1979 Herat Uprising|Herat Uprising]]. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on 11 September 1979 when [[Hafizullah Amin]] ousted [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]. The [[Soviet Union]], sensing PDPA weakness, [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened militarily three months later]], [[Operation Storm-333|to depose Amin]] and install [[Parcham|another PDA faction]] led by [[Babrak Karmal]].\n\nThe entry of Soviet forces in Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its [[Cold War]] rivals, the United States, Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[China]] to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated [[mujahideen]] held sway in much of the countryside. Besides Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]]. The [[CIA]] worked closely with Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"[[Afghan Arabs]]\", including [[Osama bin Laden]].\n\nAfter the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan]] in May 1989, the PDPA regime under [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] held on until 1992, when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] cleared the approach to [[Kabul]]. With the political stage cleared of socialists, the warlords, some of them Islamist, vied for power. By then, Bin Laden had left the country and the United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished.\n\n===Warlord rule (1992\u20131996)===\n{{Main|Afghan Civil War (1992\u201396)}}\n[[File:Massoud and Qadir 2.PNG|thumb|[[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] (right) with Pashtun anti-Taliban leader and later Vice-President of the [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]]]\n\nIn 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul.

He had founded Al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to support the Mujahideen's war against the Soviets but became disillusioned by infighting among warlords. He grew close to Mullah Omar and moved Al-Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[9/11 Commission]] in the US found that under the Taliban, al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other [[jihadist]]s, and plot terrorist actions.{{sfn|911 Commission|2004|p=66}} While al-Qaeda maintained its own [[Afghan training camp|camps in Afghanistan]], it also supported training camps of other organizations.

The Taliban repeatedly rebuffed these demands.\n\n[[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama bin Laden.

Massoud responded that, as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat, he would continue to defend it from the Taliban.<ref name=\"Webster University Press Book\" /> Around the same time, top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to try to persuade the United Front not to take advantage of a chance to make crucial gains against the Taliban.

The report emphasizes the rise of \"complex attacks\", a type of suicide assault that is becoming more deadly, described by the New York Times as the hallmark of the war in 2018. These attacks are referred to as the Taliban's ferocious response to US President Trump's new strategy of war (an increased pace of aerial bombardments targeting Taliban and Islamic State Militants), giving the message that the Taliban can strike at will, even in the capital city, Kabul. The U.N. report included a statement showing the Taliban's position, the Taliban blamed the U.S and its allies for fighting the war in Afghanistan, and it denied targeting civilians. The New York Times quoted Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired general and military analyst based in Kabul, saying that the UN report proved the failure of peace talks, as the Taliban and the US government are both determined for victory rather than negotiating a settlement. He said \"More airstrikes mean more suicide attacks,\" proving the intensification of the war by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-casualties.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAfghanistan&action=click&contentCollection=world&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection|title=More Afghan Civilians Being Deliberately Targeted, U.N.
