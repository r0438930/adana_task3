He is a writer of short stories, film scripts and poetry, and is based in Bangalore. His poetry is characterised by subtle imagism, a minute documentation of the seemingly commonplace, a colloquial idiom and a conscientious refusal to engage in any poeticising. He has so far published six anthologies of short stories, four books of poetry, three plays and a collection of essays.\n\nIn an introduction to Dots and Lines, an English translation of Kaikini's short stories, critic C.N. Ramachandran writes, \u201cTo understand Jayanth's works, we have to situate him in the literary context of the last two decades of the 20th century. During that period, there arose a group of writers who consciously differed from both the earlier Modernist writers (called Navya in Kannada) and those contemporaneous to them, the Writers of Protest (called Bandaya in Kannada) and Dalit writers. They did not subscribe to any particular philosophical or political system of thinking \u2013 be it Existentialism of the Modernists or the Leftist ideologies of the Dalit and Protest writers. On the other hand, what they wished to do was to select precise and authentic details of daily life and organise them in such a way as to culminate in a particular experience . . . Generally, their style was comic-ironic; and the language they used was the spoken language of day-to-day life. They were neither idealists nor cynics; they just wished to observe the life around them \u2013 generally mediocre \u2013 to register all the fleeting details that marked an ordinary man's daily routine, and lead up to an experience rich in connotations. Jayanth was a major figure in this group of writers who, loosely, can be called \u2018post-modernist\u2019.\u201d\n\nDr. Jayanth Kaikini started writing lyrics to film songs beginning from movie [[Chigurida Kanasu]]. Kannada film actor and singer [[Rajkumar (actor)|DR. Rajkumar]] sung \"[https://www.jiosaavn.com/song/bandhuve/IlgZARVeUF0 Bandhuve O Bandhuve]\", Kaikini's debut song, for which [[V. Manohar]] composed the music. He is the credited with revolutionising the image of Kannada film songs, with the classic touch of literature and beautiful imagery. Films like [[Mungaaru Male]], [[Gaalipata]], [[Milana (film)|Milana]] etc. have some touching and memorable songs with lyrics penned by him.\n\nHe was hosting a TV Show \"Rasa Rushige Namaskara\" in [[Etv Kannada]] which a biography on Rashtrakavi [[Kuvempu]]. This show was very popular with a particular section of audience. He continued it with other series' such as \"Kadala Theerada Bharghava\",..etc.Lately he was seen judging the\nreality show \"Yede tumbi Haaduvenu\" along with the legendary singer [[S.P.Balasubrahmanyam]] and famous [[Kannada]] music director and lyricist naada brahma [[Hamsalekha]].\n\nKaikini received the Karnataka Sahitya Academy award for his first poetry collection at the age of nineteen in 1974. He received the same award again in 1982, 1989 and 1996 for his short story collections. He has been awarded the [[Dinakara Desai]] award for his poetry, the B. H.
