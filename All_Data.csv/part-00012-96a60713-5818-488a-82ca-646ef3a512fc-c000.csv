A 2007–2008 [[Gallup Poll]] surveyed individuals in 128 countries. This poll queried whether the respondent knew of global warming. Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn’t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it’s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]<nowiki/>s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite. Opinion within the United Kingdom was divided.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Awareness\">{{Cite web|first=Brett|last=Pelham|title=Awareness, Opinions About Global Warming Vary Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization]]|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

The first major worldwide poll, conducted by Gallup in 2008–2009 in 127 countries, found that some 62% of people worldwide said they knew about global warming. In the [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] of North America, Europe, and Japan, 67% or more knew about it (97% in the U.S., 99% in Japan); in [[Developing country|developing countries]], especially in Africa, fewer than a quarter knew about it, although many had noticed local weather changes. Among those who knew about global warming, there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|title=Awareness, Opinions about Global Warming Vary Worldwide| last=Pelham | first=Brett | publisher=Gallup |year=2009 | accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

Adults in Asia, with the exception of those in developed countries, are the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat. In the western world, individuals are the most likely to be aware and perceive it as a very or somewhat serious threat to themselves and their families;<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124652/Awareness-Climate-Change-Threat-Vary-Region.aspx|title=Awareness of Climate Change and Threat Vary by Region|last1=Pugliese|first1=Anita|last2=Ray|first2=Julie|date=11 December 2009|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> although Europeans are more concerned about climate change than those in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/health/04iht-poll.4102536.html?_r=1|title=More in Europe worry about climate than in U.S., poll shows|last=Crampton|first=Thomas|date=1 January 2007|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=26 December 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> However, the public in Africa, where individuals are the most vulnerable to global warming while producing the least carbon dioxide, is the least aware – which translates into a low perception that it is a threat.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat\" />

These variations pose a challenge to [[policymaker]]s, as different countries travel down different paths, making an agreement over an appropriate response difficult. While Africa may be the most vulnerable and produce the least amount of greenhouse gases, they are the most ambivalent. The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies. People in China, Russia, and the United States, while varying in awareness, have expressed a similar proportion of aware individuals concerned. Similarly, those aware in India are likely to be concerned, but India faces challenges spreading this concern to the remaining population as its energy needs increase over the next decade.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124595/Top-Emitting-Countries-Differ-Climate-Change-Threat.aspx|title=Top-Emitting Countries Differ on Climate Change Threat|first1=Anita|last1=Pugliese|first2=Julie|last2=Ray|date=7 December 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

{{further|Climate change in the United States}}
In 2009 [[Yale University]] conducted a study identifying global warming's \"Six Americas\". The report identifies six audiences with different opinions about global warming: The alarmed (18%), the concerned (33%), the cautious (19%), the disengaged (12%), the doubtful (11%) and the dismissive (7%). The alarmed and concerned make out the largest percentage and think something should be done about global warming. The cautious, disengaged and doubtful are less likely to take action. The dismissive are convinced global warming is not happening. These audiences can be used to define the best approaches for environmental action. The theory of the 'Six Americas' is also used for marketing purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-2009/|title=Global Warming's Six Americas 2009|website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref>

In a January 2013 survey, Pew found that 69% of Americans say there is solid evidence that the Earth's average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130515145510/http://www.pewresearch.org/2013/04/02/climate-change-key-data-points-from-pew-research/ Climate Change: Key Data Points from Pew Research | Pew Research Center]</ref>

A Gallup poll in 2014 concluded that 51 percent of Americans were a little or not at all worried about climate change, 24 percent a great deal and 25 percent a fair amount.<ref name=\"Riffkin\">{{cite news|last1=Riffkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Climate Change Not a Top Worry in U.S.|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/167843/climate-change-not-top-worry.aspx|accessdate=21 July 2014|publisher=Gallup|date=12 March 2014}}</ref> 

In 2015, 32 percent or Americans were worried about global warming as a great deal, 37 percent in 2016, and 45 percent in 2017.

===Education===
{{main|Climate change education}}
In countries varying in awareness, an educational gap translates into a gap in awareness.<ref name=gap>[http://www.cultureuniversity.com/closing-massive-gaps-between-culture-awareness-education-action/ Closing the Massive Gaps Between Culture Awareness, Education, and Action]</ref> However an increase in awareness does not always result in an increase in perceived threat. In China, 98% of those who have completed four years or more of college education reported knowing something or a great deal of climate change while only 63% of those who have completed nine years of education reported the same. Despite the differences in awareness in China, all groups perceive a low level of threat from global warming. In India, those who are educated are more likely to be aware, and those who are educated there are far more likely to report perceiving global warming as a threat than those who are not educated.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" /> In Europe, individuals who have attained a higher level of education perceive climate change as a serious threat. There is also a strong association between education and Internet use. Europeans who use the Internet more are more likely to perceive climate change as a serious threat.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\" /> However, a survey of American adults found \"little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens{{clarify|date=August 2016}} on what science knows about climate change.

===Demographics===

Residential [[demographics]] affect perceptions of global warming. In China, 77% of those who live in urban areas are aware of global warming compared to 52% in rural areas. This trend is mirrored in India with 49% to 29% awareness, respectively.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" />

Of the countries where at least half the population is aware of global warming, those with the majority who believe that global warming is due to human activities have a greater national GDP per unit energy—or, a greater energy efficiency.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Energy\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117835/Views-Global-Warming-Relate-Energy-Efficiency.aspx|title=Views on Global Warming Relate to Energy Efficiency|first=Brett W.|last=Pelham|date=24 April 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

In Europe, individuals under fifty-five are more likely to perceive both \"poverty, lack of food and drinking water\" and climate change as a serious threat than individuals over fifty-five. Male individuals are more likely to perceive climate change as a threat than female individuals. Managers, white-collar workers, and students are more likely to perceive climate change as a greater threat than house persons and retired individuals.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\">{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=13}}</ref>

In the United States, conservative white men are more likely than other Americans to deny climate change.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McCright|first1=Aaron M.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Riley E.|title=Cool dudes: The denial of climate change among conservative white males in the United States|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=October 2011|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1163–72|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.06.003}}</ref>

===Political identification===
In the United States, support for environmental protection was relatively [[non-partisan]] in the twentieth century. Republican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established national parks whereas Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the [[Soil Conservation Service]]. Republican [[Richard Nixon]] was instrumental in founding the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and tried to install a third pillar of [[NATO]] dealing with environmental challenges such as acid rain and the greenhouse effect. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] was Nixon's NATO delegate for the topic.<ref name=\"Hüne\">Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), Kai F. Hünemörder, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 ISBN</ref>

This non-partisanship began to erode during the 1980s, when the [[Reagan administration]] described environmental protection as an economic burden. Views over global warming began to seriously diverge between Democrats and Republicans during the negotiations that led up to the creation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998. In a 2008 Gallup poll of the American public, 76% of Democrats and only 41% of Republicans said that they believed global warming was already happening. The opinions of the [[political elite]]s, such as members of Congress, tends to be even more polarized.<ref name=\"Dunlap2008RepublicanDemocraticGap\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107569/ClimateChange-Views-RepublicanDemocratic-Gaps-Expand.aspx|title=Climate-Change Views: Republican-Democratic Gaps Expand|first=Riley E.|last=Dunlap|date=29 May 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

Public opinion on climate change can be influenced by who people vote for. Although media coverage influences how some view climate change, research shows that voting behavior influences climate change skepticism. This shows that people’s views on climate change tend to align with the people they voted for.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCrea |first1=Rod |last2=Leviston |first2=Zoe |last3=Walker |first3=Iain A. |title=Climate Change Skepticism and Voting Behavior |journal=Environment and Behavior |date=27 July 2016 |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1309–1334 |doi=10.1177/0013916515599571}}</ref> 

In Europe, opinion is not strongly divided among [[Left-right politics|left and right parties]]. Although European political parties on the left, including [[Green parties]], strongly support measures to address climate change, conservative European political parties maintain similar sentiments, most notably in Western and Northern Europe. For example, [[Margaret Thatcher]], never a friend of the coal mining industry, was a strong supporter of an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in founding the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the British [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]].<ref>[https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/04/thatchers-climate-change-greatest-hits How Margaret Thatcher Made the Conservative Case for Climate Action], James West, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Mon Apr. 8, 2013</ref> Some speeches, as to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107346 1988 Sep 27 Tu Margaret Thatcher Speech to the Royal Society]</ref> and to the UN general assembly in November 1989 helped to put climate change, acid rain, and general pollution in the British mainstream. After her career, however, Thatcher was less of a climate activist, as she called climate action a \"marvelous excuse for supranational socialism\", and called Al Gore an \"apocalyptic hyperbole\".<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/04/08/margaret_thatcher_s_environmental_record_she_was_a_climate_hawk.html An Inconvenient Truth About Margaret Thatcher: She Was a Climate Hawk], Will Oremus, [[Slate (magazine)]] April 8, 2013</ref> France's center-right [[Jacques Chirac|President Chirac]] pushed key environmental and climate change policies in France in 2005–2007. Conservative German administrations (under the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]]) in the past two decades{{when|date=March 2019}} have supported [[European Union]] climate change initiatives; concern about [[forest dieback]] and [[acid rain]] regulation were initiated under Kohl's archconservative minister of the interior [[Friedrich Zimmermann]]. In the period after former President George W. Bush announced that the United States was leaving the [[Kyoto Treaty]], European media and newspapers on both the left and right criticized the move. The conservative Spanish ''[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]'', the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', the Danish ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', and the Greek ''[[Kathimerini]]'' all condemned the Bush administration's decision, as did left-leaning newspapers.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\">{{cite journal | first1= M.

The shared sentiments between the political left and right on climate change further illustrate the divide in perception between the United States and Europe on climate change. As an example, conservative German Prime Ministers [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Angela Merkel]] have differed with other parties in Germany only on how to meet emissions reduction targets, not whether or not to establish or fulfill them.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" />

A 2017 study found that those who changed their opinion on climate change between 2010 and 2014 did so \"primarily to align better with those who shared their party identification and political ideology. This conforms with the theory of motivated reasoning: Evidence consistent with prior beliefs is viewed as strong and, on politically salient issues, people strive to bring their opinions into conformance with those who share their political identity\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregory B.|last3=Feng|first3=Bo|date=2017-03-13|title=What Causes People to Change Their Opinion about Climate Change?|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=0|issue=4|pages=883–896|doi=10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|issn=2469-4452|url=https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/geosciences_facpub/22}}</ref> Furthermore, a 2019 study examining the growing skepticism of climate change among American Republicans argues that persuasion and rhetoric from party elites play a critical role in public opinion formation, and that these elite cues are propagated through mainstream and social media sources.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merkley |first1=Eric |last2=Stecula |first2=Dominik |title=Party Cues in the News: Elite Opinion Leadership and Climate Skepticism |journal=Toronto Political Behaviour Workshop |date=November 8-9, 2019 |page=1 |url=https://rubenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/merkley-stecula.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref>

For those who care about the environment and want change are not happy about some policies, for example the support of the cap and trade policy but very few people are willing to pay more than 15 dollars per month for a program that is supposed to help the environment.

Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, compares the different public reactions towards [[ozone depletion and global warming]].<ref name = Ungar/> The public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger.<ref name = Ungar/> Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of two to three degrees Celsius over several decades do not respond with people, e.g. in North America, that experience similar swings during a single day.<ref name = Ungar/> As scientists define global warming a problem of the future, a liability in \"[[attention economy]]\", pessimistic outlooks in general and assigning extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed (compare [[Gore effect]]) in the public arena.<ref>Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp. 133–150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events</ref> While the [[greenhouse effect]] ''[[per se (Latin)|per se]]'' is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the [[ozone shield]] and other metaphors about the ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) reflected better with lay people and their concerns.

{{\"|The idea of rays penetrating a damaged \"shield\" meshes nicely with abiding and resonant cultural motifs, including \"Hollywood affinities\". These range from the shields on the Starship Enterprise to Star Wars, ... It is these pre-scientific bridging metaphors built around the penetration of a deteriorating shield that render the ozone problem relatively simple.

The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) regulation attempts of the end of the 1980s profited from those easy-to-grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. As well the fate of celebrities like President [[Ronald Reagan]], which had skin cancer removal in 1985 and 1987, was of high importance. In case of the public opinion on climate change, no imminent danger is perceived.<ref name=Ungar>Knowledge, ignorance and the popular culture: climate change versus the ozone hole, by Sheldon Ungar, {{doi|10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/306}} Public Understanding of Science July 2000 vol. 9 no. 3 297–312 [https://web.archive.org/web/20140908033209/http://pus.sagepub.com/content/9/3/297.short Abstract]</ref>

The 2006 BBC World Service poll found that when asked about various policy options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – tax incentives for alternative energy research and development, installment of taxes to encourage energy conservation, and reliance on nuclear energy to reduce fossil fuels. The majority of those asked felt that tax incentives were the path of action that they preferred.

As of May 2016, polls have repeatedly found that a majority of Republican voters, particularly young ones, believe the government should take action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/science/donald-trump-global-warming-energy-policy-kevin-cramer.html | work=The New York Times | first=Erica | last=Goode | title=What Are Donald Trump's Views on Climate Change?

===Science===
{{See also|Scientific consensus on climate change}}
A [[scientific consensus]] on climate change exists, as recognized by national [[Academy of Sciences|academies of science]] and other authoritative bodies.<ref name=\"JointScienceAcademies2005\" />  The opinion gap between scientists and the public in 2009 stands at 84% to 49% that global temperatures are increasing because of human-activity.<ref name=\"PewResearchCenter2009PublicPraiseScientistsFault\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/528.pdf|title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media|date=9 Jun 2009|pages=5, 55|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> However, more recent research has identified substantial geographical variation in the public's understanding of the scientific consensus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Baobao|last2=van der Linden|first2=Sander|last3=Mildenberger|first3=Matto|last4=Marlon|first4=Jennifer|last5=Howe|first5=Peter|last6=Leiserowitz|first6=Anthony|title=Experimental effects of climate messages vary geographically|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=2018|volume=21|issue=5|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0122-0|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/278735|bibcode=2018NatCC...8..370Z}}</ref>

===Economics===
{{See also|Economics of global warming}}

Economic debates weigh the benefits of limiting industrial emissions of mitigating global warming against the costs that such changes would entail. While there is a greater amount of agreement over whether global warming exists, there is less agreement over the appropriate response. Electric or petroleum distribution may be government owned or utilities may be regulated by government. The government owned or regulated utilities may, or may not choose to make lower emissions a priority over economics, in unregulated counties industry follows economic priorities. An example of the economic priority is [[Royal Dutch Shell#Environmental pollution|Royal Dutch Shell PLC]] reporting CO2 emissions of 81 million metric tonnes in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Dutch Shell PLC – AMEE |url=https://www.amee.com/companies/006723599-royal-dutch-shell-plc#/tabs/environmental}}</ref>

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics of global warming}}

Public opinion impacts on the issue of climate change because governments need willing electorates and citizens in order to implement policies that address climate change. Further, when climate change perceptions differ between the populace and governments, the communication of risk to the public becomes problematic. Finally, a public that is not aware of the issues surrounding climate change may resist or oppose climate change policies, which is of considerable importance to politicians and state leaders.<ref name=\"LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006\">{{cite journal | pages = 73–95 | issue = 1–2 | doi = 10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z | issn = 1573-1480 | format = Full free text | url = http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/lev/ESSgc/lorenzoniPclimchng06.pdf | volume = 77 | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | first2 = N.

A 2009 Eurobarometer survey found that, on the average, Europeans rate climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world today, between \"poverty, the lack of food and drinking water\" and \"a major global economic downturn.\" 87% of Europeans consider climate change to be a \"serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, while 10% \"do not consider it a serious problem.\" However, the proportion who believe it to be a problem has dropped in the period 2008/9 when the surveys were conducted.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=15}}</ref> While the small majority believe climate change is a serious threat, 55% percent believe the EU is doing too little and 30% believe the EU is going the right amount.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=21}}</ref> As a result of European Union climate change perceptions, \"climate change is an issue that has reached such a level of social and political acceptability across the EU that it enables (indeed, forces) the EU Commission and national leaders to produce all sorts of measures, including taxes.\"<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" /> Despite the persistent high level of personal involvement of European citizens, found in another Eurobarometer survey in 2011,<ref>[[European Commission]], [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_372_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 372 – Climate Change] Brussels, June 2011</ref> EU leaders have begun to downscale climate policy issues on the political agenda since the beginning of the Eurozone crisis.<ref>Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2012_RP01_lpt_prt.pdf#page=19 The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it], SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01</ref>

Although public opinion may not be the only factor influencing renewable energy policies, it is a key catalyst.

A 2007–2008 [[Gallup Poll]] surveyed individuals in 128 countries. This poll queried whether the respondent knew of global warming. Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn’t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it’s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]<nowiki/>s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite.

In the [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] of North America, Europe, and Japan, 67% or more knew about it (97% in the U.S., 99% in Japan); in [[Developing country|developing countries]], especially in Africa, fewer than a quarter knew about it, although many had noticed local weather changes. Among those who knew about global warming, there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|title=Awareness, Opinions about Global Warming Vary Worldwide| last=Pelham | first=Brett | publisher=Gallup |year=2009 | accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

Adults in Asia, with the exception of those in developed countries, are the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat. In the western world, individuals are the most likely to be aware and perceive it as a very or somewhat serious threat to themselves and their families;<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124652/Awareness-Climate-Change-Threat-Vary-Region.aspx|title=Awareness of Climate Change and Threat Vary by Region|last1=Pugliese|first1=Anita|last2=Ray|first2=Julie|date=11 December 2009|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> although Europeans are more concerned about climate change than those in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/health/04iht-poll.4102536.html?_r=1|title=More in Europe worry about climate than in U.S., poll shows|last=Crampton|first=Thomas|date=1 January 2007|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=26 December 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> However, the public in Africa, where individuals are the most vulnerable to global warming while producing the least carbon dioxide, is the least aware – which translates into a low perception that it is a threat.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat\" />

These variations pose a challenge to [[policymaker]]s, as different countries travel down different paths, making an agreement over an appropriate response difficult. While Africa may be the most vulnerable and produce the least amount of greenhouse gases, they are the most ambivalent. The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies. People in China, Russia, and the United States, while varying in awareness, have expressed a similar proportion of aware individuals concerned. Similarly, those aware in India are likely to be concerned, but India faces challenges spreading this concern to the remaining population as its energy needs increase over the next decade.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124595/Top-Emitting-Countries-Differ-Climate-Change-Threat.aspx|title=Top-Emitting Countries Differ on Climate Change Threat|first1=Anita|last1=Pugliese|first2=Julie|last2=Ray|date=7 December 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

A 2010 survey of 14 [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] found that [[Climate change skeptics|skepticism]] about the danger of global warming was highest in Australia, Norway, New Zealand and the United States, in that order, correlating positively with [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|per capita emissions of carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tranter|first1=Bruce|last2=Booth|first2=Kate|title=Scepticism in a Changing Climate: A Cross-national Study|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=July 2015|volume=33|pages=54–164|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.05.003}}</ref>

==== United States====
{{further|Climate change in the United States}}
In 2009 [[Yale University]] conducted a study identifying global warming's \"Six Americas\". The report identifies six audiences with different opinions about global warming: The alarmed (18%), the concerned (33%), the cautious (19%), the disengaged (12%), the doubtful (11%) and the dismissive (7%). The alarmed and concerned make out the largest percentage and think something should be done about global warming. The cautious, disengaged and doubtful are less likely to take action. The dismissive are convinced global warming is not happening. These audiences can be used to define the best approaches for environmental action. The theory of the 'Six Americas' is also used for marketing purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-2009/|title=Global Warming's Six Americas 2009|website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref>

In a January 2013 survey, Pew found that 69% of Americans say there is solid evidence that the Earth's average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130515145510/http://www.pewresearch.org/2013/04/02/climate-change-key-data-points-from-pew-research/ Climate Change: Key Data Points from Pew Research | Pew Research Center]</ref>

A Gallup poll in 2014 concluded that 51 percent of Americans were a little or not at all worried about climate change, 24 percent a great deal and 25 percent a fair amount.<ref name=\"Riffkin\">{{cite news|last1=Riffkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Climate Change Not a Top Worry in U.S.|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/167843/climate-change-not-top-worry.aspx|accessdate=21 July 2014|publisher=Gallup|date=12 March 2014}}</ref> 

In 2015, 32 percent or Americans were worried about global warming as a great deal, 37 percent in 2016, and 45 percent in 2017. A poll taken in 2016 shows that 52% of Americans believe climate change to be [[causes of global warming|caused by human activity]], while 34% state it is caused by natural changes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/?est=happening&type=value&geo=county|title=Yale Climate Opinion Maps - U.S. 2016 - Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|work=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Data is increasingly showing that 62 percent of Americans believe that the [[effects of global warming]] are happening now in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/206030/global-warming-concern-three-decade-high.aspx|title=Global Warming Concern at Three-Decade High in U.S.|last=Inc.|first=Gallup|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-us}}</ref>

===Education===
{{main|Climate change education}}
In countries varying in awareness, an educational gap translates into a gap in awareness.<ref name=gap>[http://www.cultureuniversity.com/closing-massive-gaps-between-culture-awareness-education-action/ Closing the Massive Gaps Between Culture Awareness, Education, and Action]</ref> However an increase in awareness does not always result in an increase in perceived threat. In China, 98% of those who have completed four years or more of college education reported knowing something or a great deal of climate change while only 63% of those who have completed nine years of education reported the same. Despite the differences in awareness in China, all groups perceive a low level of threat from global warming. In India, those who are educated are more likely to be aware, and those who are educated there are far more likely to report perceiving global warming as a threat than those who are not educated.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" /> In Europe, individuals who have attained a higher level of education perceive climate change as a serious threat. There is also a strong association between education and Internet use. Europeans who use the Internet more are more likely to perceive climate change as a serious threat.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\" /> However, a survey of American adults found \"little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens{{clarify|date=August 2016}} on what science knows about climate change.

===Demographics===

Residential [[demographics]] affect perceptions of global warming. In China, 77% of those who live in urban areas are aware of global warming compared to 52% in rural areas. This trend is mirrored in India with 49% to 29% awareness, respectively.<ref name=\"PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries\" />

Of the countries where at least half the population is aware of global warming, those with the majority who believe that global warming is due to human activities have a greater national GDP per unit energy—or, a greater energy efficiency.<ref name=\"Pelham2009Energy\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117835/Views-Global-Warming-Relate-Energy-Efficiency.aspx|title=Views on Global Warming Relate to Energy Efficiency|first=Brett W.|last=Pelham|date=24 April 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

In Europe, individuals under fifty-five are more likely to perceive both \"poverty, lack of food and drinking water\" and climate change as a serious threat than individuals over fifty-five. Male individuals are more likely to perceive climate change as a threat than female individuals. Managers, white-collar workers, and students are more likely to perceive climate change as a greater threat than house persons and retired individuals.<ref name=\"Eurobarometer2009p13\">{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=13}}</ref>

===Political identification===
In the United States, support for environmental protection was relatively [[non-partisan]] in the twentieth century. Republican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established national parks whereas Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the [[Soil Conservation Service]]. Republican [[Richard Nixon]] was instrumental in founding the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and tried to install a third pillar of [[NATO]] dealing with environmental challenges such as acid rain and the greenhouse effect. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] was Nixon's NATO delegate for the topic.<ref name=\"Hüne\">Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), Kai F. Hünemörder, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 ISBN</ref>

This non-partisanship began to erode during the 1980s, when the [[Reagan administration]] described environmental protection as an economic burden. Views over global warming began to seriously diverge between Democrats and Republicans during the negotiations that led up to the creation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998. In a 2008 Gallup poll of the American public, 76% of Democrats and only 41% of Republicans said that they believed global warming was already happening. The opinions of the [[political elite]]s, such as members of Congress, tends to be even more polarized.<ref name=\"Dunlap2008RepublicanDemocraticGap\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107569/ClimateChange-Views-RepublicanDemocratic-Gaps-Expand.aspx|title=Climate-Change Views: Republican-Democratic Gaps Expand|first=Riley E.|last=Dunlap|date=29 May 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

Public opinion on climate change can be influenced by who people vote for. Although media coverage influences how some view climate change, research shows that voting behavior influences climate change skepticism. This shows that people’s views on climate change tend to align with the people they voted for.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCrea |first1=Rod |last2=Leviston |first2=Zoe |last3=Walker |first3=Iain A. |title=Climate Change Skepticism and Voting Behavior |journal=Environment and Behavior |date=27 July 2016 |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1309–1334 |doi=10.1177/0013916515599571}}</ref> 

In Europe, opinion is not strongly divided among [[Left-right politics|left and right parties]]. Although European political parties on the left, including [[Green parties]], strongly support measures to address climate change, conservative European political parties maintain similar sentiments, most notably in Western and Northern Europe. For example, [[Margaret Thatcher]], never a friend of the coal mining industry, was a strong supporter of an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in founding the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the British [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]].<ref>[https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/04/thatchers-climate-change-greatest-hits How Margaret Thatcher Made the Conservative Case for Climate Action], James West, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Mon Apr. 8, 2013</ref> Some speeches, as to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107346 1988 Sep 27 Tu Margaret Thatcher Speech to the Royal Society]</ref> and to the UN general assembly in November 1989 helped to put climate change, acid rain, and general pollution in the British mainstream. After her career, however, Thatcher was less of a climate activist, as she called climate action a \"marvelous excuse for supranational socialism\", and called Al Gore an \"apocalyptic hyperbole\".<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/04/08/margaret_thatcher_s_environmental_record_she_was_a_climate_hawk.html An Inconvenient Truth About Margaret Thatcher: She Was a Climate Hawk], Will Oremus, [[Slate (magazine)]] April 8, 2013</ref> France's center-right [[Jacques Chirac|President Chirac]] pushed key environmental and climate change policies in France in 2005–2007. Conservative German administrations (under the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]]) in the past two decades{{when|date=March 2019}} have supported [[European Union]] climate change initiatives; concern about [[forest dieback]] and [[acid rain]] regulation were initiated under Kohl's archconservative minister of the interior [[Friedrich Zimmermann]]. In the period after former President George W. Bush announced that the United States was leaving the [[Kyoto Treaty]], European media and newspapers on both the left and right criticized the move. The conservative Spanish ''[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]'', the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', the Danish ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', and the Greek ''[[Kathimerini]]'' all condemned the Bush administration's decision, as did left-leaning newspapers.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\">{{cite journal | first1= M.

The shared sentiments between the political left and right on climate change further illustrate the divide in perception between the United States and Europe on climate change. As an example, conservative German Prime Ministers [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Angela Merkel]] have differed with other parties in Germany only on how to meet emissions reduction targets, not whether or not to establish or fulfill them.<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" />

A 2017 study found that those who changed their opinion on climate change between 2010 and 2014 did so \"primarily to align better with those who shared their party identification and political ideology. This conforms with the theory of motivated reasoning: Evidence consistent with prior beliefs is viewed as strong and, on politically salient issues, people strive to bring their opinions into conformance with those who share their political identity\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregory B.|last3=Feng|first3=Bo|date=2017-03-13|title=What Causes People to Change Their Opinion about Climate Change?|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=0|issue=4|pages=883–896|doi=10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|issn=2469-4452|url=https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/geosciences_facpub/22}}</ref> Furthermore, a 2019 study examining the growing skepticism of climate change among American Republicans argues that persuasion and rhetoric from party elites play a critical role in public opinion formation, and that these elite cues are propagated through mainstream and social media sources.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merkley |first1=Eric |last2=Stecula |first2=Dominik |title=Party Cues in the News: Elite Opinion Leadership and Climate Skepticism |journal=Toronto Political Behaviour Workshop |date=November 8-9, 2019 |page=1 |url=https://rubenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/merkley-stecula.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref>

Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, compares the different public reactions towards [[ozone depletion and global warming]].<ref name = Ungar/> The public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger.<ref name = Ungar/> Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of two to three degrees Celsius over several decades do not respond with people, e.g. in North America, that experience similar swings during a single day.<ref name = Ungar/> As scientists define global warming a problem of the future, a liability in \"[[attention economy]]\", pessimistic outlooks in general and assigning extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed (compare [[Gore effect]]) in the public arena.<ref>Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp. 133–150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events</ref> While the [[greenhouse effect]] ''[[per se (Latin)|per se]]'' is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the [[ozone shield]] and other metaphors about the ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) reflected better with lay people and their concerns.

{{\"|The idea of rays penetrating a damaged \"shield\" meshes nicely with abiding and resonant cultural motifs, including \"Hollywood affinities\". These range from the shields on the Starship Enterprise to Star Wars, ... It is these pre-scientific bridging metaphors built around the penetration of a deteriorating shield that render the ozone problem relatively simple. That the ozone threat can be linked with Darth Vader means that it is encompassed in common sense understandings that are deeply ingrained and widely shared.

The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) regulation attempts of the end of the 1980s profited from those easy-to-grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. As well the fate of celebrities like President [[Ronald Reagan]], which had skin cancer removal in 1985 and 1987, was of high importance.

As of May 2016, polls have repeatedly found that a majority of Republican voters, particularly young ones, believe the government should take action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/science/donald-trump-global-warming-energy-policy-kevin-cramer.html | work=The New York Times | first=Erica | last=Goode | title=What Are Donald Trump's Views on Climate Change?

===Science===
{{See also|Scientific consensus on climate change}}
A [[scientific consensus]] on climate change exists, as recognized by national [[Academy of Sciences|academies of science]] and other authoritative bodies.<ref name=\"JointScienceAcademies2005\" />  The opinion gap between scientists and the public in 2009 stands at 84% to 49% that global temperatures are increasing because of human-activity.<ref name=\"PewResearchCenter2009PublicPraiseScientistsFault\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/528.pdf|title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media|date=9 Jun 2009|pages=5, 55|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> However, more recent research has identified substantial geographical variation in the public's understanding of the scientific consensus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Baobao|last2=van der Linden|first2=Sander|last3=Mildenberger|first3=Matto|last4=Marlon|first4=Jennifer|last5=Howe|first5=Peter|last6=Leiserowitz|first6=Anthony|title=Experimental effects of climate messages vary geographically|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=2018|volume=21|issue=5|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0122-0|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/278735|bibcode=2018NatCC...8..370Z}}</ref>

===Economics===
{{See also|Economics of global warming}}

Economic debates weigh the benefits of limiting industrial emissions of mitigating global warming against the costs that such changes would entail. While there is a greater amount of agreement over whether global warming exists, there is less agreement over the appropriate response. Electric or petroleum distribution may be government owned or utilities may be regulated by government. The government owned or regulated utilities may, or may not choose to make lower emissions a priority over economics, in unregulated counties industry follows economic priorities. An example of the economic priority is [[Royal Dutch Shell#Environmental pollution|Royal Dutch Shell PLC]] reporting CO2 emissions of 81 million metric tonnes in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Dutch Shell PLC – AMEE |url=https://www.amee.com/companies/006723599-royal-dutch-shell-plc#/tabs/environmental}}</ref>

===Media===

The efforts of [[Al Gore]] and other environmental campaigns have focused on the effects of global warming and have managed to increase awareness and concern, but despite these efforts as of 2007, the number of Americans believing humans are the cause of global warming was holding steady at 61%, and those believing the popular media was understating the issue remained about 35%.<ref name=\"Saad2007HollywoodHeathUpConcern\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26932/Did-Hollywoods-Glare-Heat-Public-Concern-About-Global-Warming.aspx|title=Did Hollywood's Glare Heat Up Public Concern About Global Warming?|first=Lydia|last=Saad|date=21 March 2007|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref>  Between 2010 and 2013, the number of Americans who believe the media under-reports the seriousness of global warming has been increasing, and the number who think media over-states it has been falling.   According to a 2013 Gallup US opinion poll, 57% believe global warming is at least as bad as portrayed in the media (with 33% thinking media has downplayed global warming and 24% saying coverage is accurate).

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics of global warming}}

Public opinion impacts on the issue of climate change because governments need willing electorates and citizens in order to implement policies that address climate change. Further, when climate change perceptions differ between the populace and governments, the communication of risk to the public becomes problematic. Finally, a public that is not aware of the issues surrounding climate change may resist or oppose climate change policies, which is of considerable importance to politicians and state leaders.<ref name=\"LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006\">{{cite journal | pages = 73–95 | issue = 1–2 | doi = 10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z | issn = 1573-1480 | format = Full free text | url = http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/lev/ESSgc/lorenzoniPclimchng06.pdf | volume = 77 | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | first2 = N.

A 2009 Eurobarometer survey found that, on the average, Europeans rate climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world today, between \"poverty, the lack of food and drinking water\" and \"a major global economic downturn.\" 87% of Europeans consider climate change to be a \"serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, while 10% \"do not consider it a serious problem.\" However, the proportion who believe it to be a problem has dropped in the period 2008/9 when the surveys were conducted.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=15}}</ref> While the small majority believe climate change is a serious threat, 55% percent believe the EU is doing too little and 30% believe the EU is going the right amount.<ref>{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=21}}</ref> As a result of European Union climate change perceptions, \"climate change is an issue that has reached such a level of social and political acceptability across the EU that it enables (indeed, forces) the EU Commission and national leaders to produce all sorts of measures, including taxes.\"<ref name=\"SchreursAndTiberghien2007\" /> Despite the persistent high level of personal involvement of European citizens, found in another Eurobarometer survey in 2011,<ref>[[European Commission]], [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_372_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 372 – Climate Change] Brussels, June 2011</ref> EU leaders have begun to downscale climate policy issues on the political agenda since the beginning of the Eurozone crisis.<ref>Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2012_RP01_lpt_prt.pdf#page=19 The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it], SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01</ref>

Although public opinion may not be the only factor influencing renewable energy policies, it is a key catalyst. Research has found that the shifts in public opinion in the direction of pro-environmentalism strongly increased the adoption of renewable energy policies in Europe, which can thus be applied in the U.S. and how important climate solutions are to Americans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Brilé |last2=Böhmelt |first2=Tobias |last3=Ward |first3=Hugh |title=Public opinion and environmental policy output: a cross-national analysis of energy policies in Europe |journal=Environmental Research Letters |date=1 November 2017 |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=114011 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aa8f80}}</ref>

The proportion of Americans who believe that the effects of global warming have begun or will begin in a few years rose to a peak in 2008 where it then declined, and a similar trend was found regarding the belief that global warming is a threat to their lifestyle within their lifetime.<ref name=\"Newman2010AmericanConcernDrop\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/126560/Americans-Global-Warming-Concerns-Continue-Drop.aspx|title=Americans' Global Warming Concerns Continue to Drop|first=Frank|last=Newport|date=11 Mar 2010|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=13 Mar 2010}}</ref> Concern over global warming often corresponds with economic downturns and national crisis such as 9/11 as Americans prioritize the economy and national security over environmental concerns. However the drop in concern in 2008 is unique compared to other environmental issues.<ref name=\"Saad2009GlobalWarmingExaggerated\" /> Considered in the context of environmental issues, Americans consider global warming as a less critical concern than the pollution of rivers, lakes, and drinking water; toxic waste; fresh water needs; air pollution; damage to the ozone layer; and the loss of tropical rain forests.

Other duties include combat [[search and rescue]] (CSAR), [[War on Drugs|counter-narcotics]], [[hostage rescue]], [[humanitarian assistance]], humanitarian [[demining]], [[Information Operations (United States)|information operations]], [[peacekeeping]], [[psychological operations (United States)|psychological operations]], and [[manhunt (military)|manhunts]]; other components of the [[United States Special Operations Command]] (USSOCOM) or other U.S. government activities may also specialize in these secondary areas.<ref name=\"JP3-05\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_05.pdf|format=PDF|title=Joint Publication 3-05: Doctrine for Joint Special Operations|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=17 December 2003|author=[[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]}}</ref> Many of their operational techniques are [[Classified information in the United States|classified]], but some nonfiction works<ref name=\"Waller\">{{Cite journal |first1 =Douglas C. |last1=Waller |title=The Commandos: The Inside Story of America's Secret Soldiers |publisher=Dell Publishing |year=1994}}</ref> and doctrinal manuals are available.<ref name=\"FM3-05\">{{Cite journal |url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-05.pdf |format=PDF|title=FM 3-05: Army Special Operations Forces |publisher=U.S. Department of the Army |date=September 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"FM3-05-102\">{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-05-102.pdf |title=FM 3-05.102 Army Special Forces Intelligence |date=July 2001 |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name=\"JP3-05-5\">{{cite web |title=Joint Publication 3-05.5: Special Operations Targeting and Mission Planning Procedures |year=1993 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_05_5.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate =13 November 2007 |author=Joint Chiefs of Staff}}</ref>

As special operations units, Special Forces are not necessarily under the command authority of the ground commanders in those countries. Instead, while in [[theater (warfare)|theater]], SF units may report directly to a geographic [[combatant command]], USSOCOM, or other command authorities.

The primary mission of the Army Special Forces is to train and lead unconventional warfare (UW) forces, or a clandestine guerrilla force in an occupied nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goarmy.com/special-forces/primary-missions.html|title=Primary Special Forces Missions |publisher=goarmy.com |access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref> The 10th Special Forces Group was the first deployed SF unit, intended to train and lead UW forces behind enemy lines in the event of a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion of Western Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} As the U.S. became involved in Southeast Asia, it was realized that specialists trained to lead guerrillas could also help defend against hostile guerrillas, so SF acquired the additional mission of [[Foreign Internal Defense]] (FID), working with Host Nation (HN) forces in a spectrum of [[Counter-guerrilla warfare|counter-guerrilla]] activities from indirect support to combat command.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Special Forces personnel qualify both in advanced military skills and the regional languages and cultures of defined parts of the world. While they are best known for their unconventional warfare capabilities, they also undertake other missions that include direct action raids, peace operations, counter-proliferation, counter-drug advisory roles, and other strategic missions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Kevin|title=Gentlemen Bastards: On the Ground in Afghanistan with America's Elite Special Forces|date=4 June 2013|publisher=Berkely Trade|location=New York|page=15}}</ref> As strategic resources, they report either to USSOCOM or to a regional [[Unified Combatant Command]]. To enhance their DA capability, specific Commanders In-Extremis Force (CIF) teams were created with a focus on the direct action side of special operations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Rowan|title=Africa's Fast-Reaction Force Ready to Go from Colorado |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/23/africas-fast-reaction-force-ready-to-go-from-color/|accessdate=2014-05-17|newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |date=23 January 2013}}</ref>

SF team members work closely together and rely on one another under isolated circumstances for long periods of time, both during extended deployments and in garrison. Because of this, they develop clannish relationships and long-standing personal ties.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} SF [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCO) often spend their entire careers in Special Forces, rotating among assignments to detachments, higher staff billets, liaison positions, and instructor duties at the U.S. Army [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]] (USAJFKSWCS). They are then required to move to staff positions or to higher command echelons. With the creation of USSOCOM, SF commanders have risen to the highest ranks of U.S. Army command, including command of [[USSOCOM]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army's Chief of Staff]], and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]].<ref>[http://www.hughshelton.com/index-3.html \"General Hugh Shelton - Without Hesitation\"].

Special Forces traces its roots as the Army's premier proponent of unconventional warfare from purpose-formed special operations units like the [[Alamo Scouts]], [[List of American guerrillas in the Philippines|Philippine guerrillas]], [[First Special Service Force]], and the Operational Groups (OGs) of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS).  Although the OSS was not an Army organization, many Army personnel were assigned to the OSS and later used their experiences to influence the forming of Special Forces.

During the [[Korean War]], individuals such as former Philippine guerrilla commanders Col. [[Wendell Fertig]] and Lt. Col. [[Russell W. Volckmann]] used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of the Special Forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) History|url=http://www.soc.mil/USASFC/USASFC%20History.html|publisher=U S ARMY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND|accessdate=2 March 2013|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528154532/http://www.soc.mil/USASFC/USASFC%20History.html|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Department of the Army (COL Russell W. Volckmann), FM 31-21, Organization and Conduct of Guerrilla Warfare (Washington, DC:  GPO, October 1951)</ref>

In 1951, Major General [[Robert A. McClure]] chose former OSS member Colonel [[Aaron Bank]] as Operations Branch Chief of the Special Operations Division of the Psychological Warfare Staff (OCPW) in the Pentagon.<ref>Officer Efficiency Report, Bank, Aaron, 11 May 1952, Aaron Bank Service Record, National Military Personnel Records Center, St. Louis, Missouri</ref>

In June 1952, the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was formed under Col. Aaron Bank, soon after the establishment of the Psychological Warfare School, which ultimately became today's [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center]] and School. The 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was split, with the cadre that kept the designation 10th SFG deployed to Bad Tölz, Germany, in September 1953. The remaining cadre at Fort Bragg formed the 77th Special Forces Group, which in May 1960 was reorganized and designated as today's 7th Special Forces Group.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) History|url=http://www.soc.mil/USASFC/USASFC%20History.html|publisher=U.S. ARMY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND|accessdate=2 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528154532/http://www.soc.mil/USASFC/USASFC%20History.html|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Since their establishment in 1952, Special Forces soldiers have operated in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, Guatemala, Nicaragua, [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]], [[Colombia]], [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]], Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, [[1st Gulf War]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], [[Iraq War|Iraq]], the Philippines, [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Yemen]], Niger and, in an FID role, [[Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa|East Africa]].

The Special Forces branch was established as a basic branch of the United States Army on April 9, 1987 by Department of the Army General Order No. 35.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/html/faq/branches/DA_GO_1987-35.pdf|title=Army General Order No. 35|last=|first=|date=June 19, 1987|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 14, 2019}}</ref>

In 1957 the two original special forces groups (10th and 77th) were joined by the 1st, stationed in the Far East. Additional groups were formed in 1961 and 1962 after President [[John F. Kennedy]] visited the Special Forces at Fort Bragg in 1961. Nine groups were organized for the reserve components in 1961.<ref>Tsouras, 1994, 91.</ref> Among them were the 16th and 17th Special Forces Groups. However, [[17th Special Forces Group]], a National Guard formation with elements in Washington, was disestablished on 31 January 1966.

In the early twenty-first century, Special Forces are divided into five [[active duty]] (AD) and two [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) Special Forces groups. Each Special Forces Group (SFG) has a specific regional focus. The Special Forces soldiers assigned to these groups receive intensive language and cultural training for countries within their regional area of responsibility (AOR).<ref name=\"USASFC\">{{cite web |URL=http://www.soc.mil/SF/SF_default.htm |title=United States Army Special Forces Command}}</ref> Due to the increased need for Special Forces soldiers in the [[War on Terror]], all groups—including those of the National Guard (19th and 20th SFGs)—have been deployed outside of their areas of operation (AOs), particularly to [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. A recently released report showed Special Forces as perhaps the most deployed SOF under USSOCOM, with many soldiers, regardless of group, serving up to 75% of their careers overseas, almost all of which had been to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Until recently an SF group has consisted of three battalions, but since the Department of Defense has authorized the 1st Special Forces Command to increase its authorized strength by one third, a fourth battalion was activated in each active component group by 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

A Special Forces group is historically assigned to a [[Unified Combatant Command]] or a theater of operations. The Special Forces Operational Detachment C or C-detachment (SFODC) is responsible for a theater or a major subcomponent, which can provide command and control of up to 18 SFODAs, three SFODB, or a mixture of the two. Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs. Further subordinate, the SFODAs typically raise company- to battalion-sized units when on unconventional warfare missions. They can form 6-man \"split A\" detachments that are often used for special reconnaissance.
{{Table of United States Army Special Forces Groups}}

===Battalion Headquarters Element – SF Operational Detachment-C (SFODC) composition===
The SFODC, or \"C-Team\", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies. A lieutenant colonel commands the battalion as well as the C-Team, and the Battalion Command Sergeant Major is the senior NCO of the battalion and the C-Team. There is an additional 20–30 SF personnel who fill key positions in operations, logistics, intelligence, communications and medical. A Special Forces battalion usually consists of four companies: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and Headquarters/Support.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Company Headquarters Element – SF Operational Detachment-B (SFODB) composition===
[[File: Special Forces commander meets with village elders Afghanistan 2007.jpg|right|thumb|A SF company commander meets with elders and members of the 209th [[Afghan National Army|ANA]] Corps in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, circa 2007]]
[[File:Special Forces Medic in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A soldier from A Co, 1st Bn, 7th SFG(A) gives an [[Afghan]] boy a coloring book in [[Kandahar Province]] during a meeting with local leaders, circa 2008]]
The ODB, or \"B-Team\", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11–13 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company's A-Teams both in garrison and in the field. When deployed, in line with their support role, B-Teams are usually found in more secure rear areas. However, under some circumstances a B-Team will deploy into a hostile area, usually to coordinate the activities of multiple A-Teams.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The ODB is led by an 18A, usually a major, who is the [[company commander]] (CO). The CO is assisted by his company [[executive officer]] (XO), another 18A, usually a captain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://10th-sfg.weebly.com/about.html|title=About|website=10th Special Forces Group|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref> The XO is himself assisted by a company technician, a 180A, generally a chief warrant officer three, who assists in the direction of the organization, training, intelligence, counter-intelligence, and operations for the company and its detachments. The company commander is assisted by the company sergeant major, an 18Z, usually a Sergeant Major. A second 18Z acts as the operations sergeant, usually a Master Sergeant, who assists the XO and technician in their operational duties. He has an 18F assistant operations sergeant, who is usually a Sergeant First Class. The company's support comes from an 18D medical sergeant, usually a Sergeant First Class, and two 18E communications sergeants, usually a Sergeant First Class and a Staff Sergeant.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The following jobs are outside of the Special Forces 18-series career management field (CMF), but hold positions on a Special Forces B-Team. Soldiers in these positions are not \"Special Forces qualified\", as they have not completed the [[Special Forces Qualification Course]] (SFQC or \"Q\" Course); however, they do have the potential to be awarded the Special Qualification Identifier (SQI) \"S\" (Special Operations / Special Operations Support) once they complete the appropriate unit level training, 24 months with their Special Forces unit, and Basic Airborne School:
* The [[Military supply chain management|supply]] NCO, usually a Staff Sergeant, the commander's principal logistical planner, works with the battalion [[S4 (military)|S-4]] to supply the company.
* The Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear ([[CBRN defense]]) NCO, usually a Sergeant, maintains and operates the company's NBC detection and decontamination equipment, and assists in administering NBC defensive measures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.campbell.army.mil/sf/structure.htm |title= Structure |accessdate=8 March 2007 |work=Fort Campbell |publisher=United States Army |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070322174635/http://www.campbell.army.mil/sf/structure.htm <!--None--> |archivedate = 22 March 2007}}</ref>
* Other jobs can also exist depending on the B-Team structure. Specialist team members can include I.T. (S-6) personnel, and Military Intelligence Soldiers, including Intelligence Analysts (35F), Human Intelligence Collectors (35M), Signals Intelligence (35 N/P - also known as [[SOT-A]] and SOT-B as related to their positions on SFODA and SFODB teams), Intelligence Officers (35 D/E/F), and [[United States Army Counterintelligence|Counterintelligence Special Agents]] (35L/351L).

==={{Anchor|ODA}} Basic Element – SF Operational Detachment-A (SFODA) composition===
A Special Forces company normally consists of six ODAs (Operational Detachments-A) or \"A-Teams.\"<ref>[http://www.army.mil/-news/2009/10/26/29315-special-forces---shooters-and-thinkers/ USASOC. 'Special Forces – Shooters and thinkers'. ''WWW.ARMY.MIL The official homepage of the United States army'' (26 October 2009)]. Retrieved on 5 January 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://specialforces.americanspecialops.com/odas/|title=Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha (SFOD A)|publisher=}}</ref> Each ODA specializes in an infiltration skill or a particular mission-set (e.g. Military Freefall (HALO), combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, etc.). An ODA is identified by its group, battalion, company, and the team itself. For example, ODA 1234 would be the fourth team in the third company of the second battalion of 1st Special Forces Group.

An ODA consists of 12 soldiers, each of whom has a specific function (MOS or [[Military Occupational Specialty]]) on the team, however all members of an ODA conduct cross-training. The ODA is led by an 18A (Detachment Commander), a [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]], and a 180A (Assistant Detachment Commander) who is their second in command, usually a [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Warrant Officer]] One or Chief Warrant Officer Two. The team also includes the following enlisted soldiers: one 18Z (Operations Sergeant) (known as the \"Team Sergeant\"), usually a Master Sergeant, one 18F (Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant), usually a Sergeant First Class, and two each, 18Bs (Weapons Sergeant), 18Cs (Engineer Sergeant), 18Ds (Medical Sergeant), and 18Es (Communications Sergeant), usually Sergeants First Class, Staff Sergeants or Sergeants. This organization facilitates 6-man \"split team\" operations, redundancy, and mentoring between a senior NCO and their junior assistant.

==Selection and training==
{{Main|United States Army Special Forces selection and training}}

The Special Forces soldier trains on a regular basis over the course of their entire career. The initial formal training program for entry into Special Forces is divided into four phases collectively known as the Special Forces Qualification Course or, informally, the \"Q Course\". The length of the Q Course changes depending on the applicant's primary job field within Special Forces and their assigned foreign language capability, but will usually last between 55 and 95 weeks. After successfully completing the Special Forces Qualification Course, Special Forces soldiers are then eligible for many advanced skills courses. These include, but are not limited to, the [[Military Freefall Parachutist Badge|Military Free Fall Parachutist Course]] (MFF), the [[Diver insignia#United States Army|Combat Diver Qualification Course]], and the Special Forces Sniper Course (SFSC).{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

U.S. Army Special Forces adopted the [[green beret]] unofficially in 1954 after searching for headgear that would set them visually apart. Members of the 77th SFG began searching through their accumulated berets and settled on the rifle green color from Captain [[Miguel de la Peña]]'s collection.

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] authorized them for use exclusively by the U.S. Special Forces. Preparing for a 12 October visit to the Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the president sent word to the center's commander, Colonel [[William P. Yarborough]], for all Special Forces soldiers to wear green berets as part of the event. The president felt that since they had a special mission, Special Forces should have something to set them apart from the rest. In 1962, he called the green beret \"a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark of distinction in the fight for freedom.\"<ref name=\":1\" />

Forrest Lindley, a writer for the newspaper ''Stars and Stripes'' who served with Special Forces in Vietnam said of Kennedy's authorization: \"It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret. People were sneaking around wearing [them] when conventional forces weren't in the area and it was sort of a cat and mouse game. Then Kennedy authorized the Green Beret as a mark of distinction, everybody had to scramble around to find berets that were really green. We were bringing them down from Canada. Some were handmade, with the dye coming out in the rain.\"<ref name=\"JFKSF\">{{cite news |title=Washington Talk: John F.

Kennedy's actions created a special bond with the Special Forces, with specific traditions carried out since his funeral, when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces soldiers guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin.<ref name=\"JFKSF\"/> The moment was repeated at a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of JFK's death – General [[Michael D. Healy]] (ret.), the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam and later a commander of the [[John F.

===Distinctive Unit Insignia===

A silver color metal and enamel device 1 1/8 inches (2.86 cm) in height consisting of a pair of silver arrows in saltire, points up and surmounted at their junction by a silver dagger with black handle point up; all over and between a black motto scroll arcing to base and inscribed \"DE OPPRESSO LIBER\" in silver letters.<ref name=\"SF DUI\">[https://tioh.army.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=4351&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services 1st Special Forces, Distinctive Unit Insignia], [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]], dated 27 October 2016, last accessed 8 March 2020. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

The insignia is the crossed arrow collar insignia (insignia of branch) of the First Special Force, World War II combined with the fighting knife which is of a distinctive shape and pattern only issued to the First Special Service Force. The motto is translated as \"From Oppression We Will Liberate Them.\"<ref name=\"SF DUI\"/>

The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 8 July 1960. The insignia of the 1st Special Forces was authorized to be worn by personnel of the U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) and its subordinate units on 7 March 1991. The wear of the insignia by the U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) and its subordinate units was cancelled and it was authorized to be worn by personnel of the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) and their subordinate units not authorized a distinctive unit insignia in their own right and amended to change the symbolism on 27 October 2016.<ref name=\"SF DUI\"/>

The US Army's 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) [[shoulder sleeve insignia]] (SSI) is worn by all those assigned to the command and its subordinate units that have not been authorized their own SSI, such as the Special Forces Groups.  According to the [[U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]], the shape and items depicted in the SSI have special meaning: \"The arrowhead alludes to the American Indian's basic skills in which Special Forces personnel are trained to a high degree.  The dagger represents the unconventional nature of Special Forces operations, and the three lightning flashes, their ability to strike rapidly by Sea, Air or Land.\" Army Special Forces were the first Special Operations unit to employ the \"sea, air, land\" concept nearly a decade before units like the Navy SEALs were created.<ref name=\"SSI\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20161211054155/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=4353&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services U.S. Army Special Forces Group (Airborne), Shoulder Sleeve Insignia], US Army Institute of Heraldry via WebArchive, dated 27 October 2016, last accessed 19 March 2019</ref>

Prior to the establishment of the 1st Special Forces Command SSI, the special forces groups that stood up between 1952 and 1955 wore the Airborne Command SSI.

===The Tab===
[[File:SpecialForcesTabMetal.jpg|200px|thumb|Special Forces Qualification Tab]]
Introduced in June 1983, the [[Special Forces Tab]] is a service school qualification tab awarded to soldiers who complete one of the [[Special Forces Qualification Course]]s.  Unlike the Green Beret, soldiers who are awarded the Special Forces Tab are authorized to wear it for the remainder of their military careers, even when not serving with Special Operations units.  The cloth tab is an olive drab arc tab 3 1/4 inches (8.26&nbsp; cm) in length and 11/16 inch (1.75&nbsp; cm) in height overall, the designation \"SPECIAL FORCES\" in black letters 5/16 inch (.79&nbsp; cm) in height and is worn on the left sleeve of utility uniforms above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia]] and below the [[President's Hundred Tab]] (if so awarded). The metal Special Forces Tab replica comes in two sizes, full and dress miniature. The full size version measures 5/8 inch (1.59&nbsp;cm) in height and 1 9/16 inches (3.97&nbsp;cm) in width. The miniature version measures 1/4 inch (.64&nbsp;cm) in height and 1 inch (2.54&nbsp;cm) in width. Both are teal blue with yellow border trim and letters and are worn above or below ribbons or medals on the [[Army Service Uniform]].<ref name=\"TIOH Tab\">[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=16094&CategoryId=20&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services&ps=24&p=0 Special Forces Tab], [[The Institute of heraldry]], last accessed 24 June 2014</ref><ref name=\"AR600-8-22\">[http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_8_22.pdf U.S. Army Regulation 600–8–22: Personnel-General: Military Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722181345/http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_8_22.pdf |date=22 July 2011 }}, Official Department of the Army Publications and Forms, dated 24 June 2013, last accessed 23 June 2014 (page 117-118)</ref><ref>[http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p670_1.pdf U.S. Army Pamphlet 670-1: Uniform and Insignia, Guide to the Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506235717/http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p670_1.pdf |date=6 May 2014 }}, Official Department of the Army Publications and Forms, dated 31 March 2014, last accessed 23 June 2014 (pages 6, 201, 244–245, 252, 256, 258–260)</ref>

== Use of the term \"Special Forces\" ==
In countries other than the U.S., the term \"special forces\" or \"special operations forces\" (SOF) is often used generically to refer to any units with elite training and special mission sets. In the U.S. military, \"Special Forces\" is a proper (capitalized) noun referring exclusively to U.S. Army Special Forces (a.k.a. \"The Green Berets\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/29315/special-forces---shooters-and-thinkers/|title=Special Forces - Shooters and thinkers|access-date=2016-08-10}}</ref> The media and popular culture frequently misapply the term to [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] and other members of the [[United States special operations forces|U.S. Special Operations Forces]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Green_Berets_vs_Navy_SEALs|title=Green Berets vs Navy SEALs - Difference and Comparison {{!}} Diffen|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}</ref>

== Use of the term \"Operator\" ==
[[File:Code of the Special Forces Operator.jpg|thumb|\"Code of the Special Forces Operator,\" circa 1959. This example pre-dates \"Delta\" among others.]]
The origin of the term ''operator'' in American special operations comes from the U.S. Army Special Forces (referred to by many civilians as \"Green Berets\"). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the Navy SEALs and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marines|Marines]] was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the ''''Code of the Special Forces Operator'''' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\". ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'' (V14/N1), pp. 63–64.</ref>

Inside the [[USSOCOM|United States Special Operations]] community, an ''operator'' is a [[Delta Force]] member who has completed selection and has graduated OTC (Operators Training Course). ''Operator'' was used by Delta Force to distinguish between operational and non-operational personnel assigned to the unit.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite book |last=Haney |first=Eric L. |authorlink=Eric Haney |title=[[Inside Delta Force]] |publisher=[[Delacorte Press]] |year=2002 |location=New York |page=325 |isbn=978-0-385-33603-1}}</ref>  Other [[United States special operations forces|special operations forces]] use specific names for their jobs, such as Army ''Rangers'' and Air Force ''Pararescuemen''. The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created '''\"Special Warfare Operator\" (SO)''' as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades E-4 to E-9. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]). ''Operator'' is the specific term for operational personnel, and has become a colloquial term for almost all special operations forces in the U.S. military, as well as around the world.

The '''United States Army Special Forces''', colloquially known as the '''Green Berets''' due to their distinctive service headgear, are a [[special operations force]] of the [[United States Army]] that are designed to deploy and execute nine doctrinal missions: [[unconventional warfare]], [[foreign internal defense]], [[direct action (military)|direct action]], [[counter-insurgency]], [[special reconnaissance]], [[counter-terrorism]], [[information operations]], [[counterproliferation]] of [[weapons of mass destruction]], and [[Security Force Assistance Brigade#Overview|security force assistance]] via seven geographically focused groups:<ref name=\"USASOC\">[http://www.soc.mil/USASOCHQ/USASOCHQFactSheet.html Army Special Operations Forces Fact Book 2018], USASOC official website, dated 2018, last accessed 28 July 2019</ref>  The first two emphasize language, cultural, and training skills in working with foreign troops. Other duties include combat [[search and rescue]] (CSAR), [[War on Drugs|counter-narcotics]], [[hostage rescue]], [[humanitarian assistance]], humanitarian [[demining]], [[Information Operations (United States)|information operations]], [[peacekeeping]], [[psychological operations (United States)|psychological operations]], and [[manhunt (military)|manhunts]]; other components of the [[United States Special Operations Command]] (USSOCOM) or other U.S. government activities may also specialize in these secondary areas.<ref name=\"JP3-05\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_05.pdf|format=PDF|title=Joint Publication 3-05: Doctrine for Joint Special Operations|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=17 December 2003|author=[[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]}}</ref> Many of their operational techniques are [[Classified information in the United States|classified]], but some nonfiction works<ref name=\"Waller\">{{Cite journal |first1 =Douglas C. |last1=Waller |title=The Commandos: The Inside Story of America's Secret Soldiers |publisher=Dell Publishing |year=1994}}</ref> and doctrinal manuals are available.<ref name=\"FM3-05\">{{Cite journal |url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-05.pdf |format=PDF|title=FM 3-05: Army Special Operations Forces |publisher=U.S. Department of the Army |date=September 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"FM3-05-102\">{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-05-102.pdf |title=FM 3-05.102 Army Special Forces Intelligence |date=July 2001 |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name=\"JP3-05-5\">{{cite web |title=Joint Publication 3-05.5: Special Operations Targeting and Mission Planning Procedures |year=1993 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_05_5.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate =13 November 2007 |author=Joint Chiefs of Staff}}</ref>

As special operations units, Special Forces are not necessarily under the command authority of the ground commanders in those countries. Instead, while in [[theater (warfare)|theater]], SF units may report directly to a geographic [[combatant command]], USSOCOM, or other command authorities.

The primary mission of the Army Special Forces is to train and lead unconventional warfare (UW) forces, or a clandestine guerrilla force in an occupied nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goarmy.com/special-forces/primary-missions.html|title=Primary Special Forces Missions |publisher=goarmy.com |access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref> The 10th Special Forces Group was the first deployed SF unit, intended to train and lead UW forces behind enemy lines in the event of a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion of Western Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} As the U.S. became involved in Southeast Asia, it was realized that specialists trained to lead guerrillas could also help defend against hostile guerrillas, so SF acquired the additional mission of [[Foreign Internal Defense]] (FID), working with Host Nation (HN) forces in a spectrum of [[Counter-guerrilla warfare|counter-guerrilla]] activities from indirect support to combat command.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Special Forces personnel qualify both in advanced military skills and the regional languages and cultures of defined parts of the world. While they are best known for their unconventional warfare capabilities, they also undertake other missions that include direct action raids, peace operations, counter-proliferation, counter-drug advisory roles, and other strategic missions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Kevin|title=Gentlemen Bastards: On the Ground in Afghanistan with America's Elite Special Forces|date=4 June 2013|publisher=Berkely Trade|location=New York|page=15}}</ref> As strategic resources, they report either to USSOCOM or to a regional [[Unified Combatant Command]]. To enhance their DA capability, specific Commanders In-Extremis Force (CIF) teams were created with a focus on the direct action side of special operations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Rowan|title=Africa's Fast-Reaction Force Ready to Go from Colorado |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/23/africas-fast-reaction-force-ready-to-go-from-color/|accessdate=2014-05-17|newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |date=23 January 2013}}</ref>

SF team members work closely together and rely on one another under isolated circumstances for long periods of time, both during extended deployments and in garrison. Because of this, they develop clannish relationships and long-standing personal ties.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} SF [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCO) often spend their entire careers in Special Forces, rotating among assignments to detachments, higher staff billets, liaison positions, and instructor duties at the U.S. Army [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]] (USAJFKSWCS). They are then required to move to staff positions or to higher command echelons. With the creation of USSOCOM, SF commanders have risen to the highest ranks of U.S. Army command, including command of [[USSOCOM]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army's Chief of Staff]], and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]].<ref>[http://www.hughshelton.com/index-3.html \"General Hugh Shelton - Without Hesitation\"].

Special Forces traces its roots as the Army's premier proponent of unconventional warfare from purpose-formed special operations units like the [[Alamo Scouts]], [[List of American guerrillas in the Philippines|Philippine guerrillas]], [[First Special Service Force]], and the Operational Groups (OGs) of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS).  Although the OSS was not an Army organization, many Army personnel were assigned to the OSS and later used their experiences to influence the forming of Special Forces.

During the [[Korean War]], individuals such as former Philippine guerrilla commanders Col. [[Wendell Fertig]] and Lt. Col. [[Russell W. Volckmann]] used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of the Special Forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) History|url=http://www.soc.mil/USASFC/USASFC%20History.html|publisher=U S ARMY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND|accessdate=2 March 2013|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528154532/http://www.soc.mil/USASFC/USASFC%20History.html|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Department of the Army (COL Russell W. Volckmann), FM 31-21, Organization and Conduct of Guerrilla Warfare (Washington, DC:  GPO, October 1951)</ref>

In 1951, Major General [[Robert A. McClure]] chose former OSS member Colonel [[Aaron Bank]] as Operations Branch Chief of the Special Operations Division of the Psychological Warfare Staff (OCPW) in the Pentagon.<ref>Officer Efficiency Report, Bank, Aaron, 11 May 1952, Aaron Bank Service Record, National Military Personnel Records Center, St. Louis, Missouri</ref>

In June 1952, the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was formed under Col. Aaron Bank, soon after the establishment of the Psychological Warfare School, which ultimately became today's [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center]] and School. The 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was split, with the cadre that kept the designation 10th SFG deployed to Bad Tölz, Germany, in September 1953. The remaining cadre at Fort Bragg formed the 77th Special Forces Group, which in May 1960 was reorganized and designated as today's 7th Special Forces Group.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) History|url=http://www.soc.mil/USASFC/USASFC%20History.html|publisher=U.S. ARMY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND|accessdate=2 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528154532/http://www.soc.mil/USASFC/USASFC%20History.html|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Since their establishment in 1952, Special Forces soldiers have operated in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, Guatemala, Nicaragua, [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]], [[Colombia]], [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]], Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, [[1st Gulf War]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], [[Iraq War|Iraq]], the Philippines, [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Yemen]], Niger and, in an FID role, [[Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa|East Africa]].

The Special Forces branch was established as a basic branch of the United States Army on April 9, 1987 by Department of the Army General Order No. 35.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/html/faq/branches/DA_GO_1987-35.pdf|title=Army General Order No. 35|last=|first=|date=June 19, 1987|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 14, 2019}}</ref>

In 1957 the two original special forces groups (10th and 77th) were joined by the 1st, stationed in the Far East. Additional groups were formed in 1961 and 1962 after President [[John F. Kennedy]] visited the Special Forces at Fort Bragg in 1961. Nine groups were organized for the reserve components in 1961.<ref>Tsouras, 1994, 91.</ref> Among them were the 16th and 17th Special Forces, Groups. However, [[17th Special Forces Group]], a National Guard formation with elements in Washington, was disestablished on 31 January 1966.

In the early twenty-first century, Special Forces are divided into five [[active duty]] (AD) and two [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) Special Forces groups. Each Special Forces Group (SFG) has a specific regional focus. The Special Forces soldiers assigned to these groups receive intensive language and cultural training for countries within their regional area of responsibility (AOR).<ref name=\"USASFC\">{{cite web |URL=http://www.soc.mil/SF/SF_default.htm |title=United States Army Special Forces Command}}</ref> Due to the increased need for Special Forces soldiers in the [[War on Terror]], all Groups—including those of the National Guard (19th and 20th SFGs)—have been deployed outside of their areas of operation (AOs), particularly to [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. A recently released report showed Special Forces as perhaps the most deployed SOF under USSOCOM, with many soldiers, regardless of Group, serving up to 75% of their careers overseas, almost all of which had been to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Until recently an SF group has consisted of three battalions, but since the Department of Defense has authorized the 1st Special Forces Command to increase its authorized strength by one third, a fourth battalion was activated in each active component group by 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

A Special Forces group is historically assigned to a [[Unified Combatant Command]] or a theater of operations. The Special Forces Operational Detachment C or C-detachment (SFODC) is responsible for a theater or a major subcomponent, which can provide command and control of up to 18 SFODAs, three SFODB, or a mixture of the two. Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs. Further subordinate, the SFODAs typically raise company- to battalion-sized units when on unconventional warfare missions. They can form 6-man \"split A\" detachments that are often used for special reconnaissance.
{{Table of United States Army Special Forces Groups}}

===Battalion Headquarters Element – SF Operational Detachment-C (SFODC) composition===
The SFODC, or \"C-Team\", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies. A lieutenant colonel commands the battalion as well as the C-Team, and the Battalion Command Sergeant Major is the senior NCO of the battalion and the C-Team. There is an additional 20–30 SF personnel who fill key positions in operations, logistics, intelligence, communications and medical. A Special Forces battalion usually consists of four companies: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and Headquarters/Support.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Company Headquarters Element – SF Operational Detachment-B (SFODB) composition===
[[File: Special Forces commander meets with village elders Afghanistan 2007.jpg|right|thumb|A SF company commander meets with elders and members of the 209th [[Afghan National Army|ANA]] Corps in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, circa 2007]]
[[File:Special Forces Medic in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A soldier from A Co, 1st Bn, 7th SFG(A) gives an [[Afghan]] boy a coloring book in [[Kandahar Province]] during a meeting with local leaders, circa 2008]]
The ODB, or \"B-Team\", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11–13 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company's A-Teams both in garrison and in the field. When deployed, in line with their support role, B-Teams are usually found in more secure rear areas. However, under some circumstances a B-Team will deploy into a hostile area, usually to coordinate the activities of multiple A-Teams.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The ODB is led by an 18A, usually a major, who is the [[company commander]] (CO). The CO is assisted by his company [[executive officer]] (XO), another 18A, usually a captain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://10th-sfg.weebly.com/about.html|title=About|website=10th Special Forces Group|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref> The XO is himself assisted by a company technician, a 180A, generally a chief warrant officer three, who assists in the direction of the organization, training, intelligence, counter-intelligence, and operations for the company and its detachments. The company commander is assisted by the company sergeant major, an 18Z, usually a Sergeant Major. A second 18Z acts as the operations sergeant, usually a Master Sergeant, who assists the XO and technician in their operational duties. He has an 18F assistant operations sergeant, who is usually a Sergeant First Class. The company's support comes from an 18D medical sergeant, usually a Sergeant First Class, and two 18E communications sergeants, usually a Sergeant First Class and a Staff Sergeant.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The following jobs are outside of the Special Forces 18-series career management field (CMF), but hold positions on a Special Forces B-Team. Soldiers in these positions are not \"Special Forces qualified\", as they have not completed the [[Special Forces Qualification Course]] (SFQC or \"Q\" Course); however, they do have the potential to be awarded the Special Qualification Identifier (SQI) \"S\" (Special Operations / Special Operations Support) once they complete the appropriate unit level training, 24 months with their Special Forces unit, and Basic Airborne School:
* The [[Military supply chain management|supply]] NCO, usually a Staff Sergeant, the commander's principal logistical planner, works with the battalion [[S4 (military)|S-4]] to supply the company.
* The Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear ([[CBRN defense]]) NCO, usually a Sergeant, maintains and operates the company's NBC detection and decontamination equipment, and assists in administering NBC defensive measures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.campbell.army.mil/sf/structure.htm |title= Structure |accessdate=8 March 2007 |work=Fort Campbell |publisher=United States Army |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070322174635/http://www.campbell.army.mil/sf/structure.htm <!--None--> |archivedate = 22 March 2007}}</ref>
* Other jobs can also exist depending on the B-Team structure. Specialist team members can include I.T. (S-6) personnel, and Military Intelligence Soldiers, including Intelligence Analysts (35F), Human Intelligence Collectors (35M), Signals Intelligence (35 N/P - also known as [[SOT-A]] and SOT-B as related to their positions on SFODA and SFODB teams), Intelligence Officers (35 D/E/F), and [[United States Army Counterintelligence|Counterintelligence Special Agents]] (35L/351L).

==={{Anchor|ODA}} Basic Element – SF Operational Detachment-A (SFODA) composition===
A Special Forces company normally consists of six ODAs (Operational Detachments-A) or \"A-Teams.\"<ref>[http://www.army.mil/-news/2009/10/26/29315-special-forces---shooters-and-thinkers/ USASOC. 'Special Forces – Shooters and thinkers'. ''WWW.ARMY.MIL The official homepage of the United States army'' (26 October 2009)]. Retrieved on 5 January 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://specialforces.americanspecialops.com/odas/|title=Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha (SFOD A)|publisher=}}</ref> Each ODA specializes in an infiltration skill or a particular mission-set (e.g. Military Freefall (HALO), combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, etc.). An ODA is identified by its group, battalion, company, and the team itself. For example, ODA 1234 would be the fourth team in the third company of the second battalion of 1st Special Forces Group.

An ODA consists of 12 soldiers, each of whom has a specific function (MOS or [[Military Occupational Specialty]]) on the team, however all members of an ODA conduct cross-training. The ODA is led by an 18A (Detachment Commander), a [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]], and a 180A (Assistant Detachment Commander) who is their second in command, usually a [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Warrant Officer]] One or Chief Warrant Officer Two. The team also includes the following enlisted soldiers: one 18Z (Operations Sergeant) (known as the \"Team Sergeant\"), usually a Master Sergeant, one 18F (Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant), usually a Sergeant First Class, and two each, 18Bs (Weapons Sergeant), 18Cs (Engineer Sergeant), 18Ds (Medical Sergeant), and 18Es (Communications Sergeant), usually Sergeants First Class, Staff Sergeants or Sergeants. This organization facilitates 6-man \"split team\" operations, redundancy, and mentoring between a senior NCO and their junior assistant.

==Selection and training==
{{Main|United States Army Special Forces selection and training}}

The Special Forces soldier trains on a regular basis over the course of their entire career. The initial formal training program for entry into Special Forces is divided into four phases collectively known as the Special Forces Qualification Course or, informally, the \"Q Course\". The length of the Q Course changes depending on the applicant's primary job field within Special Forces and their assigned foreign language capability, but will usually last between 55 and 95 weeks. After successfully completing the Special Forces Qualification Course, Special Forces soldiers are then eligible for many advanced skills courses. These include, but are not limited to, the [[Military Freefall Parachutist Badge|Military Free Fall Parachutist Course]] (MFF), the [[Diver insignia#United States Army|Combat Diver Qualification Course]], and the Special Forces Sniper Course (SFSC).{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

U.S. Army Special Forces adopted the [[green beret]] unofficially in 1954 after searching for headgear that would set them visually apart. Members of the 77th SFG began searching through their accumulated berets and settled on the rifle green color from Captain [[Miguel de la Peña]]'s collection.

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] authorized them for use exclusively by the U.S. Special Forces. Preparing for a 12 October visit to the Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the president sent word to the center's commander, Colonel [[William P. Yarborough]], for all Special Forces soldiers to wear green berets as part of the event. The president felt that since they had a special mission, Special Forces should have something to set them apart from the rest. In 1962, he called the green beret \"a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark of distinction in the fight for freedom.\"<ref name=\":1\" />

Forrest Lindley, a writer for the newspaper ''Stars and Stripes'' who served with Special Forces in Vietnam said of Kennedy's authorization: \"It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret. People were sneaking around wearing [them] when conventional forces weren't in the area and it was sort of a cat and mouse game. Then Kennedy authorized the Green Beret as a mark of distinction, everybody had to scramble around to find berets that were really green. We were bringing them down from Canada. Some were handmade, with the dye coming out in the rain.\"<ref name=\"JFKSF\">{{cite news |title=Washington Talk: John F.

Kennedy's actions created a special bond with the Special Forces, with specific traditions carried out since his funeral, when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces soldiers guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin.<ref name=\"JFKSF\"/> The moment was repeated at a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of JFK's death – General [[Michael D.

===Distinctive Unit Insignia===

A silver color metal and enamel device 1 1/8 inches (2.86 cm) in height consisting of a pair of silver arrows in saltire, points up and surmounted at their junction by a silver dagger with black handle point up; all over and between a black motto scroll arcing to base and inscribed \"DE OPPRESSO LIBER\" in silver letters.<ref name=\"SF DUI\">[https://tioh.army.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=4351&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services 1st Special Forces, Distinctive Unit Insignia], [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]], dated 27 October 2016, last accessed 8 March 2020. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

The insignia is the crossed arrow collar insignia (insignia of branch) of the First Special Force, World War II combined with the fighting knife which is of a distinctive shape and pattern only issued to the First Special Service Force. The motto is translated as \"From Oppression We Will Liberate Them.\"<ref name=\"SF DUI\"/>

The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 8 July 1960. The insignia of the 1st Special Forces was authorized to be worn by personnel of the U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) and its subordinate units on 7 March 1991. The wear of the insignia by the U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) and its subordinate units was cancelled and it was authorized to be worn by personnel of the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) and their subordinate units not authorized a distinctive unit insignia in their own right and amended to change the symbolism on 27 October 2016.<ref name=\"SF DUI\"/>

The US Army's 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) [[shoulder sleeve insignia]] (SSI) is worn by all those assigned to the command and its subordinate units that have not been authorized their own SSI, such as the Special Forces Groups.  According to the [[U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]], the shape and items depicted in the SSI have special meaning: \"The arrowhead alludes to the American Indian's basic skills in which Special Forces personnel are trained to a high degree.  The dagger represents the unconventional nature of Special Forces operations, and the three lightning flashes, their ability to strike rapidly by Sea, Air or Land.\" Army Special Forces were the first Special Operations unit to employ the \"sea, air, land\" concept nearly a decade before units like the Navy SEALs were created.<ref name=\"SSI\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20161211054155/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=4353&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services U.S. Army Special Forces Group (Airborne), Shoulder Sleeve Insignia], US Army Institute of Heraldry via WebArchive, dated 27 October 2016, last accessed 19 March 2019</ref>

Prior to the establishment of the 1st Special Forces Command SSI, the special forces groups that stood up between 1952 and 1955 wore the Airborne Command SSI.

===The Tab===
[[File:SpecialForcesTabMetal.jpg|200px|thumb|Special Forces Qualification Tab]]
Introduced in June 1983, the [[Special Forces Tab]] is a service school qualification tab awarded to soldiers who complete one of the [[Special Forces Qualification Course]]s.  Unlike the Green Beret, soldiers who are awarded the Special Forces Tab are authorized to wear it for the remainder of their military careers, even when not serving with Special Operations units.  The cloth tab is an olive drab arc tab 3 1/4 inches (8.26&nbsp; cm) in length and 11/16 inch (1.75&nbsp; cm) in height overall, the designation \"SPECIAL FORCES\" in black letters 5/16 inch (.79&nbsp; cm) in height and is worn on the left sleeve of utility uniforms above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia]] and below the [[President's Hundred Tab]] (if so awarded). The metal Special Forces Tab replica comes in two sizes, full and dress miniature. The full size version measures 5/8 inch (1.59&nbsp;cm) in height and 1 9/16 inches (3.97&nbsp;cm) in width. The miniature version measures 1/4 inch (.64&nbsp;cm) in height and 1 inch (2.54&nbsp;cm) in width. Both are teal blue with yellow border trim and letters and are worn above or below ribbons or medals on the [[Army Service Uniform]].<ref name=\"TIOH Tab\">[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=16094&CategoryId=20&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services&ps=24&p=0 Special Forces Tab], [[The Institute of heraldry]], last accessed 24 June 2014</ref><ref name=\"AR600-8-22\">[http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_8_22.pdf U.S. Army Regulation 600–8–22: Personnel-General: Military Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722181345/http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_8_22.pdf |date=22 July 2011 }}, Official Department of the Army Publications and Forms, dated 24 June 2013, last accessed 23 June 2014 (page 117-118)</ref><ref>[http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p670_1.pdf U.S. Army Pamphlet 670-1: Uniform and Insignia, Guide to the Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506235717/http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p670_1.pdf |date=6 May 2014 }}, Official Department of the Army Publications and Forms, dated 31 March 2014, last accessed 23 June 2014 (pages 6, 201, 244–245, 252, 256, 258–260)</ref>

== Use of the term \"Special Forces\" ==
In countries other than the U.S., the term \"special forces\" or \"special operations forces\" (SOF) is often used generically to refer to any units with elite training and special mission sets. In the U.S. military, \"Special Forces\" is a proper (capitalized) noun referring exclusively to U.S. Army Special Forces (a.k.a. \"The Green Berets\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/29315/special-forces---shooters-and-thinkers/|title=Special Forces - Shooters and thinkers|access-date=2016-08-10}}</ref> The media and popular culture frequently misapply the term to [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] and other members of the [[United States special operations forces|U.S. Special Operations Forces]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Green_Berets_vs_Navy_SEALs|title=Green Berets vs Navy SEALs - Difference and Comparison {{!}} Diffen|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}</ref>

== Use of the term \"Operator\" ==
[[File:Code of the Special Forces Operator.jpg|thumb|\"Code of the Special Forces Operator,\" circa 1959. This example pre-dates \"Delta\" among others.]]
The origin of the term ''operator'' in American special operations comes from the U.S. Army Special Forces (referred to by many civilians as \"Green Berets\"). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the Navy SEALs and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marines|Marines]] was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the ''''Code of the Special Forces Operator'''' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\". ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'' (V14/N1), pp. 63–64.</ref>

Inside the [[USSOCOM|United States Special Operations]] community, an ''operator'' is a [[Delta Force]] member who has completed selection and has graduated OTC (Operators Training Course). ''Operator'' was used by Delta Force to distinguish between operational and non-operational personnel assigned to the unit.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite book |last=Haney |first=Eric L. |authorlink=Eric Haney |title=[[Inside Delta Force]] |publisher=[[Delacorte Press]] |year=2002 |location=New York |page=325 |isbn=978-0-385-33603-1}}</ref>  Other [[United States special operations forces|special operations forces]] use specific names for their jobs, such as Army ''Rangers'' and Air Force ''Pararescuemen''. The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created '''\"Special Warfare Operator\" (SO)''' as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades E-4 to E-9. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]). ''Operator'' is the specific term for operational personnel, and has become a colloquial term for almost all special operations forces in the U.S. military, as well as around the world.

In a ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' interview with Gaga's makeup artist Sarah Tanno, Tanno described using pieces that evoke armor to satisfy Gaga's desire to feel strong for the video.

This armor naturally will come in different shades of metallic pink,\"<ref name=\":2\" /> explained Tanno. Wanting the pieces to move with Gaga as she moved and danced, Tanno crafted the face pieces out of materials resembling bone prosthetics instead of opting for metal.<ref name=\":2\" /> Unlike the face pieces, Gaga's costumes featured pieces crafted of actual metal designed by Laurel DeWitt. \"The mood boards were a crazy mash of futuristic armor, aliens, and even an insect type vibe. Everything had to be pink so I worked with her style team and just did my interpretation on it. Pink metal! I mean c'mon!

[[British Vogue|British ''Vogue'']] described Gaga's look for the music video as a \"Y2K-inspired desert warrior\"<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/lady-gaga-stupid-love-video|title=Lady Gaga Is A Y2K-Inspired Desert Warrior In First Clips Of Her \"Stupid Love\" Music Video|website=British Vogue|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229221237/https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/lady-gaga-stupid-love-video|archive-date=February 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and called the singer's aesthetics a return to her \"[[Lady Gaga's meat dress|meat-dress]]-era form.\"<ref name=\":8\" /> Dave Holmes for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' described Gaga's dancing in the video as \"back to a kind of movement that is less 'dance' and more a series of gestures. The classics are back: 'wrists on forehead' makes a triumphant return, as do 'hand covering eye' and 'forearms in x formation.{{'\"}}<ref name=\":7\" /> Craig Jenkins for ''[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'' described the video as a \"purposeful visual overkill\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/lady-gaga-stupid-love-song-review.html|title=Lady Gaga's Message Remains Clear on 'Stupid Love': Just Dance|last=Jenkins|first=Craig|date=2020-02-28|website=Vulture|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228232300/https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/lady-gaga-stupid-love-song-review.html|archive-date=February 28, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> with tight choreography and compared the video to the music video for \"[[Genesis (Grimes song)|Genesis]]\" by [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], the video game ''[[Bayonetta]]'', and ''[[Star Trek]]''.<ref name=\":4\" /> Brandon Wetmore for ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' magazine described the video as a ''[[Mad Max]]''-evoking \"[[pride parade]]\"<ref name=\":3\" /> pairing \"[[Bad Romance]]\"-era choreography with ''[[Artpop]]''-era [[Camp (style)|camp]] and contrasted the vibrancy and color of the video with the muted and somber tones of the visuals from the previous ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|A Star Is Born]]'' era.<ref name=\":3\" /> Alexa Camp for ''Slant Magazine'' was critical of the single and its video, calling the video corny and lacking \"the (comparatively) sophisticated mythology or narrative of videos like 2011's 'Born This Way.{{'\"}}<ref name=\":10\" />

'''William Ronald Dodds Fairbairn''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛər|b|ɛər|n}}) [[FRSE]] (11 August 1889 – 31 December 1964) was a Scottish psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and a central figure in the development of the [[object relations theory]] of psychoanalysis.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Illusion Of Love: Why The Battered Woman Returns To Her Abuser|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0231100373|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>

==Life==
[[File:The Red House, Cluny Gardens.jpg|thumb|Fairbairn's birthplace - The Red House, Cluny Gardens]]

Ronald Fairbairn was born at the Red House, Cluny Gardens,<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90</ref> in [[Morningside, Edinburgh]] in 1889, the only child of Cecilia Leefe and Thomas Fairbairn, a chartered surveyor, and President of the Edinburgh Architectural Association.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40312|title=Fairbairn, (William) Ronald Dodds (1889–1964), psychiatrist and psychoanalyst|last=|first=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40312}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he studied for three years in [[divinity]] and [[Hellenic Greek]] studies, graduating MA in 1911.

In the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Royal Engineers]] and served under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestinian campaign]], and then the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].

On his return to home he began medical training, probably inspired by his war experience. He received a doctorate in Medicine (MD) on 30 March 1929 from the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"Archive\">Available at the [https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/9999 Edinburgh Research Archive].</ref> From 1927 to 1935 he lectured in psychology at the University and also independently practised analysis. From 1941 until 1954 he was Consultant Psychiatrist to the [[Ministry of Pensions]].<ref name=\":1\" />

In 1931 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[James Drever]], [[Edwin Bramwell]], Sir Godfrey Hilton Thomson and [[Robert Alexander Fleming]].

On the basis of his writings he became an associate member of the British Psychoanalytical Society in 1931, becoming a full member in 1939. Fairbairn, though somewhat isolated in that he spent his entire career in Edinburgh,<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Charles Rycroft|last=Rycroft|first=Charles | title=Psychoanalysis and after | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=132}}</ref> had a profound influence on British Object Relations and the relational schools. Fairbairn was one of the theory-builders for the [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|Middle Group]]<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=21}}</ref> (now called the Independent Group) psychoanalysts. The Independent Group contained analysts who identified with neither the [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]ians nor the [[Anna Freud]]ians. They were more concerned with the relationships between people than with the \"drives\" within them.

He died in Edinburgh at the age of 75. He is buried with his wives in [[Dean Cemetery]] in western [[Edinburgh]]. The grave lies very close to the main east entrance and lodge-house.

==Family==

In 1926 Fairbairn married Mary Ann More Gordon (1901–1952) the daughter of Harry More Gordon. Their daughter Ellinor was born in 1927, followed by twins in 1928, however they did not survive. Their fourth child was born in 1929, and in 1933 their fifth son [[Nicholas Fairbairn|Nicholas]] was born, who would go on to become a barrister and MP.<ref name=\":0\" />

In 1959 he married Marion Frances Mackintosh (1907–1995), daughter of Captain H. E. M. Archer.<ref name=\":0\" />

===''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'' (1952)===

The importance of Fairbain's work lies in its direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. 

Fairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models—the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious—as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. 

Greenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  
<blockquote>
In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>
The psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id—Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives—is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures—Id, Ego, and Super Ego—mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. 

In contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>
Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. … At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     
</blockquote>
Over time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.

In his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>
… (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.… So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>
The more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:
<blockquote>
Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> 
</blockquote>
Fairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment, and that is intolerable-to accept parental failures, force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. 

Typically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>
It is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    
</blockquote>
Simply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.

===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====
Fairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.
Fairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>
Thus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>
The greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>
Thus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  

The unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting oObject in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   

Secondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. 

Fairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   

===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====
Fairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation, which was to search for a good object, and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model was not a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book in 1983,<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world, and simultaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once there it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child's needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individual's life.     

Once these \"bad-object\" memories are dissociated and repressed they become the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second and third points in this quote can exacerbate or mitigate the impact of these bad object internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, they will never comprehend what happened to them, and how it influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                    

Fairbairn noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\". Once again the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to support the illusion that he/she is living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.          

Then Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, of different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents by their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                                    

Fairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. Here he begins to think about the effects of a Good Object- one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects (which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway, and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently the patient stubbornly clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.

The 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. 

Fairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through, is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" />

=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===
{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}
Fairbairn's 1944 article described his structural theory in terms of six structures, including two conscious structures, '''The Central Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''', and two '''pairs''' of unconscious structures. The unconscious structures are: '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Rejecting object''', and:  '''The Libidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Exciting Object'''. The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates. The simple reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community,as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different than the the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships and there are dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized includes the typical dialogues that were originally in the external world, but now continue in the internal world.  

As described in previous sections the neglected child solves the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. Prior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>convinced him that  children separated from their families experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. 

==== Fairbairn's Structural Model and the Splitting of the Ego ====
In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent called the Rejecting Object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions which was called  the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2010)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Within the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego '''relates only to the''' Rejecting Object''',''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent, called the Ideal Object, and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. 

'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  never develops '''\"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no memory of the other ego state which is repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref> 

==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====
The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. 

In less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego. A powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51–71}}</ref> 

'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''

When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />

'''William Ronald Dodds Fairbairn''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛər|b|ɛər|n}}) [[FRSE]] (11 August 1889 – 31 December 1964) was a Scottish psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and a central figure in the development of the [[object relations theory]] of psychoanalysis.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Illusion Of Love: Why The Battered Woman Returns To Her Abuser|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0231100373|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>

==Life==
[[File:The Red House, Cluny Gardens.jpg|thumb|Fairbairn's birthplace - The Red House, Cluny Gardens]]

Ronald Fairbairn was born at the Red House, Cluny Gardens,<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90</ref> in [[Morningside, Edinburgh]] in 1889, the only child of Cecilia Leefe and Thomas Fairbairn, a chartered surveyor, and President of the Edinburgh Architectural Association.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40312|title=Fairbairn, (William) Ronald Dodds (1889–1964), psychiatrist and psychoanalyst|last=|first=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40312}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he studied for three years in [[divinity]] and [[Hellenic Greek]] studies, graduating MA in 1911.

In the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Royal Engineers]] and served under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestinian campaign]], and then the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].

On his return to home he began medical training, probably inspired by his war experience. He received a doctorate in Medicine (MD) on 30 March 1929 from the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"Archive\">Available at the [https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/9999 Edinburgh Research Archive].</ref> From 1927 to 1935 he lectured in psychology at the University and also independently practised analysis. From 1941 until 1954 he was Consultant Psychiatrist to the [[Ministry of Pensions]].<ref name=\":1\" />

In 1931 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[James Drever]], [[Edwin Bramwell]], Sir Godfrey Hilton Thomson and [[Robert Alexander Fleming]].

On the basis of his writings he became an associate member of the British Psychoanalytical Society in 1931, becoming a full member in 1939. Fairbairn, though somewhat isolated in that he spent his entire career in Edinburgh,<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Charles Rycroft|last=Rycroft|first=Charles | title=Psychoanalysis and after | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=132}}</ref> had a profound influence on British Object Relations and the relational schools. Fairbairn was one of the theory-builders for the [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|Middle Group]]<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=21}}</ref> (now called the Independent Group) psychoanalysts. The Independent Group contained analysts who identified with neither the [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]ians nor the [[Anna Freud]]ians. They were more concerned with the relationships between people than with the \"drives\" within them.

He died in Edinburgh at the age of 75. He is buried with his wives in [[Dean Cemetery]] in western [[Edinburgh]]. The grave lies very close to the main east entrance and lodge-house.

==Family==

In 1926 Fairbairn married Mary Ann More Gordon (1901–1952) the daughter of Harry More Gordon. Their daughter Ellinor was born in 1927, followed by twins in 1928, however they did not survive. Their fourth child was born in 1929, and in 1933 their fifth son [[Nicholas Fairbairn|Nicholas]] was born, who would go on to become a barrister and MP.<ref name=\":0\" />

In 1959 he married Marion Frances Mackintosh (1907–1995), daughter of Captain H. E. M. Archer.<ref name=\":0\" />

===''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'' (1952)===

The importance of Fairbain's work lies in its direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. 

Fairbairn's model is  classified as psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models—the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious—as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. 

Greenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn.  
<blockquote>
In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>
The psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id—Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives—is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures—Id, Ego, and Super Ego—mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. 

In contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairburn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>
Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. … At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     
</blockquote>
Over time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.

===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====

In his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics. <blockquote>
… (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.… So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>
The more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:
<blockquote>
Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> 
</blockquote>
Fairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment, and that  that the intolerable-to accept parental failures force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. 

Typically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>
It is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    
</blockquote>
Simply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.

===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====
Fairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of  \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.
Fairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>
Thus, the developmental proceeds, the child gradually realizes that is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>
The greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>
Thus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  

The unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the antilibidinal ego ad he rejecting object in the splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   

Secondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has been validated by the  millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. 

Fairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individual who either live at home with their ageing parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   

===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====
Fairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues.  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought , is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation which was to search for a good object and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's\"challenge\" of the Freudian model was not a problem for the analytic community despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book in 1983,<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love,help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world  and simultaneously forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individuals life.     

Once these \"bad-object\" memories are dissociated and repressed they become the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second and third points in this quote can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these bad object internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, they will never comprehend what happened to them, and how it influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                    

Fairbairn noticed that children whom had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" Once again, the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a  loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife..         <blockquote>It become obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that  one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good'. In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so,he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to support the illusion that he/she is living in a loving family.. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being  lazy, disrespectful, or of being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that he parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.          

Then Fairbairn returned to  his earlier discussion that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers of different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic.Here, he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated.        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also,and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents by their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5,6,7,8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                                    

Fairbairn then took up new topics in he same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper which will be described in the next section). The two topics were his theory of treatment and his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the bad object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. Here, he begins to think about the effects of a good object- one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects (which ideally should be present in every child's life)  have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved-albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship  with he analyst as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69) .<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn  identifies one of the key mutaive factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus, a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently, the patient stubbornly clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.

The 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests the Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is  coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. 

Fairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and too the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for, when such bad objects are released the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of he chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe\"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released , however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actual reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through is absolutely correct.Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced  divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" /> 

=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===
{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}
Fairbairn's 1944 article described his structural theory in terms of six structures, including two conscious structures, '''The Central Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''', and two '''pairs''' of unconscious structures. The unconscious structures are: '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Rejecting object''', and:  '''The Libidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Exciting Object'''. The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates. The simple reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community,as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different than the the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships and there are dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized includes the typical dialogues that were originally in the external world, but now continue in the internal world.  

As described in previous sections the neglected child solves the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. Prior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>convinced him that  children separated from their families experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. 

==== Fairbairn's Structural Model and the Splitting of the Ego ====
In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent called the Rejecting Object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions which was called  the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2010)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Within the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego '''relates only to the''' Rejecting Object''',''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent, called the Ideal Object, and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. 

'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  never develops '''\"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no memory of the other ego state which is repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref> 

==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====
The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. 

In less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego. A powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51–71}}</ref> 

'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''

When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />

The film, starring Affleck as Mendez, and [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Alan Arkin]], and [[John Goodman]] in supporting roles, was released in the United States on October 12, 2012. It was produced by [[Grant Heslov]], Affleck and [[George Clooney]].

''Argo'' was praised for the acting (particularly Arkin and Goodman's), Affleck's direction, Terrio's screenplay, the editing, and Desplat's score. The film received seven nominations at the [[85th Academy Awards]] and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film also earned five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations: it won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture]] for Alan Arkin. It won [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[19th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and Arkin was nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]]. It also won [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]] at the [[66th British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Hochi Film Award|37th Hochi Film Award]] for Best International Picture.

Despite its praise, ''Argo'' has been criticized for some specific inaccuracies, in particular for minimizing the role of the Canadian embassy in the rescue, for falsely showing that the Americans were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies, and for exaggerating the danger the group faced during events preceding their escape from the country.

== Plot ==
On November 4, 1979, Iranian [[Islamism|Islamists]] storm the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|United States embassy in Tehran]] in retaliation for President [[Jimmy Carter]] giving the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] asylum in the U.S. during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Sixty of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] begins to explore options for [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] them from Iran. [[Tony Mendez]], a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] exfiltration specialist, is brought in for a consultation. He criticizes the proposals but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching [[Battle for the Planet of the Apes|''Battle for the Planet of the Apes'']] and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees: that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film.

Mendez contacts [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]], a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing ''Argo'', a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and finally realize that some personnel are unaccounted for.

Posing as a producer for ''Argo'', Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with [[Canadian passports]] and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|bazaar]] to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when they are harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd.

Mendez is told that the operation has been canceled to avoid conflicting with a [[Operation Eagle Claw|planned military rescue of the hostages]]. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and confirm their tickets on a [[Swissair]] flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' ticket reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and the head guard's call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. The group boards the airliner, which takes off just as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] at the airport are informed of the ruse and try to stop them.

To protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed, and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador (who shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife as the operation is underway). The ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]. Mendez is awarded the [[Intelligence Star]], but due to the mission's classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterward. The award is restored to him after the [[Canadian Caper]] is declassified in 1997.

==Production==
''Argo'' is based on the \"Canadian Caper\" that took place during the [[Iran hostage crisis]] in 1979 and 1980. [[Chris Terrio]] wrote the screenplay based on Joshuah Bearman's 2007 article \"How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran,\" which was published in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref name=\"Bearman\"/>

In 2007, the producers [[George Clooney]], [[Grant Heslov]] and [[David Klawans]] set up a project based on the article. Affleck's participation was announced in February 2011.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McNary |first=Dave |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031570 |title=Affleck in talks to direct 'Argo' |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109035540/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031570 |archivedate=November 9, 2012 }}</ref> The following June, Alan Arkin was the first person cast in the film.<ref name=\"First\">{{cite journal|last=Sneider |first=Jeff |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038411 |title=Alan Arkin first to board 'Argo' |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109035626/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038411 |archivedate=November 9, 2012 }}</ref> After the rest of the roles were cast, filming began in [[Los Angeles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmapia.com/published/scenes?placeId=1825&movie=argo|title=Scenes from 'Argo' shot in 'Los Angeles'|publisher=filmapia|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}</ref> in August 2011.

As a historical piece, the film made use of archival news footage from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]; and included popular songs from the era, such as \"[[Little T&A]]\" by [[The Rolling Stones]] (an anachronism, as it was not released until the following year), \"[[Sultans of Swing]]\" by [[Dire Straits]], \"[[Dance the Night Away (Van Halen song)|Dance the Night Away]]\" by [[Van Halen]] and \"[[When the Levee Breaks]]\" by [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref>[http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/argo Argo (2012) – Soundtrack.net]</ref> For its part, Warner Bros. used its 1972–1984 title featuring the \"Big W\" logo designed by [[Saul Bass]] for [[Warner Communications]] to open the film and painted on its studio lot's famed water tower the logo of The Burbank Studios (the facility's name during the 1970s and 1980s when Warner shared it with [[Columbia Pictures]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haithman | first=Diane |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/oscars-argo-production-design/|title=OSCARS: Re-Creating The Look Of The '70s For 'Argo'|journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 31, 2012}}</ref>

The screenplay used by the CIA to create their cover story was an adaptation of [[Roger Zelazny]]'s 1967 novel ''[[Lord of Light]]''.  Producer Barry Geller had spearheaded an earlier attempt to produce the film using the original title. After that production attempt failed, the screenplay was renamed ''Argo'' and used by the CIA.<ref name=\"Bearman\"/><ref>{{cite web | last1=Higgins | first1=Bill | last2=Kit | first2=Borys |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ben-affleck-argo-odd-hollywood-history-374054| title=The Odd Hollywood History Behind Ben Affleck's 'Argo' | work=Hollywood Reporter | date=September 26, 2012 | accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref>

According to Tony Mendez, Studio Six—the phony Hollywood production office he helped create at the core of the CIA plan—proved so convincing that even weeks after the rescue was complete and the office had folded, 26 scripts were delivered to its address, including one from [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref name=Lane>{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=Anthony|title=Film Within A Film|journal=The New Yorker|date=October 15, 2012|page=99|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2012/10/15/121015crci_cinema_lane|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref>

===Critical response===
''Argo'' was acclaimed by critics, praising Ben Affleck's direction, the cast (especially Arkin and Goodman), the script and the editing. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 96%, based on 351 reviews, with an [[weighted mean|average]] rating of 8.39/10.

Naming ''Argo'' one of the best 11 films of 2012, critic [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"Ben Affleck's seamless direction catapults him to the forefront of Hollywood filmmakers turning out thoughtful entertainment.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=The Year of the Body Vulnerable|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/movies/lincoln-and-amour-top-stephen-holdens-best-of-list.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2012|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Times]]'' said it felt \"like a movie from an earlier era — less frenetic, less showy, more focused on narrative than sensation,\" but that the script included \"too many characters that he doesn't quite develop.\"<ref>Peter Suderman, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/11/movie-review-argo/ Movie Review: 'Argo'], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', October 11, 2012</ref>

Writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] said, 
{{quote|The craft in this film is rare. It is so easy to manufacture a thriller from chases and gunfire, and so very hard to fine-tune it out of exquisite timing and a plot that's so clear to us we wonder why it isn't obvious to the Iranians. After all, who in their right mind would believe a space opera was being filmed in Iran during the hostage crisis?<ref name=\"ebert\" />}}Ebert gave the film 4/4 stars, calling it \"spellbinding\" and \"surprisingly funny,\" and chose it as the best film of the year, the last film he would choose for this honor before his death in 2013.<ref name=ebert>Ebert, Roger (10 October 2012).

Literary critic [[Stanley Fish]] says that the film is a standard [[caper film]] in which \"some improbable task has to be pulled off by a combination of ingenuity, training, deception and luck.\" He goes on to describe the film's structure: \"(1) the presentation of the scheme to reluctant and unimaginative superiors, (2) the transformation of a ragtag bunch of ne'er-do-wells and wackos into a coherent, coordinated unit and (3) the carrying out of the task.\"<ref name=\"fish\"/>

Although he thinks the film is good at building and sustaining suspense, he concludes,
{{quote|This is one of those movies that depend on your not thinking much about it; for as soon as you reflect on what's happening rather than being swept up in the narrative flow, there doesn't seem much to it aside from the skill with which suspense is maintained despite the fact that you know in advance how it's going to turn out. ... Once the deed is successfully done, there's really nothing much to say, and anything that is said seems contrived. That is the virtue of an entertainment like this; it doesn't linger in the memory and provoke afterthoughts.<ref name=\"fish\">{{cite news|first=Stanley|last=Fish|title=The 'Argo' Caper|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/the-argo-caper/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref>}}

===Reaction by Iranians===
[[Abolhassan Banisadr]], foreign minister and then president during the incident, argued that the movie does not take into account the fact that most of [[Interim Government of Iran (1979)|the cabinet members]] advocated freeing all the American personnel quickly.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parry|first=Robert|title='October Surprise' and 'Argo'|url=http://consortiumnews.com/2013/03/07/october-surprise-and-argo/|accessdate=July 30, 2013|work=Consortium News|date= March 7, 2013}}</ref> [[Jian Ghomeshi]], a Canadian writer and radio figure of Iranian descent, thought the film had a \"deeply troubling portrayal of the Iranian people.\" Ghomeshi asserted \"among all the rave reviews, virtually no one in the mainstream media has called out [the] unbalanced depiction of an entire ethnic national group, and the broader implications of the portrait.\" He also suggested that the timing of the film was poor, as American and Iranian political relations were at a low point.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ghomeshi|first=Jian|title=Argo is crowd-pleasing, entertaining – and unfair to Iranians|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/jian-ghomeshi-argo-is-crowd-pleasing-entertaining-and-unfair-to-iranians/article4855769/|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=November 2, 2012|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> University of Michigan history professor [[Juan Cole]] had a similar assessment, writing that the film's narrative fails to provide adequate historical context for the events it portrays, and such errors of omission lead all of the Iranian characters in the film to be depicted as ethnic stereotypes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Juan|title=\"Argo\" as Orientalism and why it Upsets Iranians| url=http://www.juancole.com/2013/02/orientalism-upsets-iranians.html|work=Informed Comment|date=January 26, 2013| accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> A November 3, 2012 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' claimed that the film had received very little attention in Tehran, though [[Masoumeh Ebtekar]], who was the spokesperson of the students who took the hostages and called only \"Tehran Mary\" in the film's credits, said that the film did not show \"the real reasons behind the event.\"<ref>{{cite news| last=Mostaghim|first=Ramin|author2=Alexandra Sandels|title=U.S. film 'Argo' not getting any buzz in Iran|work=Los Angeles Times| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/03/world/la-fg-iran-argo-20121104|date=November 3, 2012|accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref>

Bootleg DVDs have become popular and are estimated at \"several hundreds of thousands\" of copies. Interpretations of the film's popularity in Iran have varied, ranging from the fact that the movie portrays the excesses of the revolution and the hostage crisis, which had been long glorified in Iran, to Iranians viewing it as a reminder of what caused the poor relations with America and the ensuing cost to Iran, decades after the embassy takeover.<ref name=\"Kamali\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2012/nov/13/argo-iranians-ben-affleck|title=Why Argo is hard for Iranians to watch|author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan|date=November 13, 2012|work=The Guardian|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}</ref> The high DVD sales suggests a form of silent protest against the government's ongoing hostility to relations with America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578263610160724572|title=Iran's Latest Hit: Bootleg 'Argo' DVDs|last=Fassihi|first=Farnaz|date=February 1, 2013|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref>

[[File:ThanksCanada.JPG|thumb|right|People welcoming the six American diplomats back to the United States and expressing thanks to Canada, 1980]]

In a CNN interview, former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] addressed the controversy: 
{{quote|90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan was Canadian. And the movie gives almost full credit to the American CIA. And with that exception, the movie is very good. But Ben Affleck's character in the film was... only in Tehran a day and a half. And the main hero, in my opinion, was [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]], who was the Canadian ambassador who orchestrated the entire process.<ref>{{cite news| last=McDevitt| first=Caitlin| title=Jimmy Carter: 'Argo' great but inaccurate| url= http://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2013/02/jimmy-carter-argo-great-but-inaccurate-157592.html| accessdate=February 22, 2013| newspaper=Politico| date=February 22, 2013}}</ref>}}Taylor noted, \"In reality, Canada was responsible for the six and the CIA was a junior partner. But I realize this is a movie and you have to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.\"<ref name=KnelmanTorStar2 /> In the film, Taylor is shown threatening to close the Canadian embassy. This did not happen, and the Canadians never considered abandoning the six Americans who had taken refuge under their protection.<ref name=KnelmanTorStar2 />

Affleck asserted: 
{{quote|Because we say it's based on a true story, rather than this is a true story, we're allowed to take some dramatic license. There's a spirit of truth .... the kinds of things that are really important to be true are—for example, the relationship between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. stood up collectively as a nation and said, \"We like you, we appreciate you, we respect you, and we're in your debt.\"... There were folks who didn't want to stick their necks out and the Canadians did. They said, \"We'll risk our diplomatic standing, our lives, by harbouring six Americans because it's the right thing to do.\"  Because of that, their lives were saved.\"<ref name=Macleans />}}

===British and New Zealand roles===
Upon its release in October 2012, the film was criticized for its suggestion that [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[New Zealand]] embassies had turned away the American refugees in Tehran. Neither the British nor the New Zealand embassies had turned the refugees away. Both embassies, along with the Canadians, helped them. The British took immense risks,{{cn|date=April 2020}} having initially hosted the American refugees. However, the location was deemed unsafe as the British embassy itself had been targeted and surrounded by mobs and all involved officials from the various nations believed the Canadian ambassador's residence to be a safer location. New Zealand diplomatic ambassadors also took huge risks: organizing a place for the refugees to hide if they needed to change their location,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Opinion-Ben-Affleck-must-apologise-to-NZ-for-Argos-deception/tabid/1382/articleID/288296/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title=Opinion: Ben Affleck must apologise to NZ for Argo's deception |date=February 27, 2013}}</ref> and driving the Americans to the airport when they made their escape from Tehran.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/NZs-role-in-Iran-crisis-tainted-in-Afflecks-film-Argo/tabid/418/articleID/273069/Default.aspx |title=NZ's role in Iran crisis tainted in Affleck's film 'Argo' – Story – Entertainment |work=3 News |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref> British diplomats also assisted other American hostages beyond the escaped group of six.<ref>{{cite web|author=Film |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/9622647/Ben-Afflecks-new-film-Argo-upsets-British-diplomats-who-helped-Americans-in-Iran.html |title=Ben Affleck's new film 'Argo' upsets British diplomats who helped Americans in Iran |work=Telegraph|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref> Bob Anders, the U.S. consular agent played in the film by [[Tate Donovan]], said, \"They put their lives on the line for us.

[[Sir John Graham, 4th Baronet|Sir John Graham]], the then-[[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Iran|British ambassador to Iran]], said, 
{{quote|My immediate reaction on hearing about this was one of outrage. I have since simmered down, but am still very distressed that the film-makers should have got it so wrong. My concern is that the inaccurate account should not enter the mythology of the events in Tehran in November 1979.\"<ref name = \"Telegraph UK review\"/>}} The then-British [[chargé d'affaires]] in Tehran said that, had the Americans been discovered in the British embassy, \"I can assure you we'd all have been for the high jump.\"<ref name = \"Telegraph UK review\"/> [[Martin Williams (diplomat)|Martin Williams]], secretary to Sir John Graham in Iran at the time, was the one who found the Americans, after searching for them in his own British car (the only [[Austin Maxi]] in Iran) and first sheltered them in his own house.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

Affleck is quoted as saying to ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'': \"I struggled with this long and hard, because it casts Britain and New Zealand in a way that is not totally fair. But I was setting up a situation where you needed to get a sense that these six people had nowhere else to go. It does not mean to diminish anyone.\"<ref name = \"Telegraph UK review\" />
On March 12, 2013, the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] censured Affleck by  unanimously agreeing to the following motion, initiated by [[New Zealand First]] leader [[Winston Peters]]:
{{quote|... this House acknowledge[s] with gratitude the efforts of former New Zealand diplomats Chris Beeby and Richard Sewell in assisting American hostages in Tehran during the hostage crisis in 1979, and express[es] its regret that the director of the movie'' Argo ''saw fit to mislead the world about what actually happened during that crisis when, in reality, our courageous diplomats' inspirational actions were of significant help to the American hostages and deserve the factual and historical record to be corrected.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/document/50HansD_20130312_00000008/motions-human-rights-fiji-treatment-of-detainees-iran |title=Motions—Iran Hostage Crisis—Fictional Representation of Role of New Zealand Diplomats|publisher=Hansard Office, New Zealand Parliament|date= March 12, 2013|accessdate=March 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/movie-argo-misled-the-world/story-e6frf7k6-1226595680820|title=Movie Argo 'misled the world'|work=Herald Sun|date=March 12, 2013 |accessdate=March 12, 2013}}</ref>}}

===Imminent danger to the group===
In the film, the diplomats face suspicious glances from Iranians whenever they go out in public, and appear close to being caught at many steps along the way to their freedom. In reality, the diplomats never appeared to be in imminent danger.<ref name=\"Macleans\"/><ref name=\"KnelmanTorStar2\"/><ref name=\"BBC News - Argo\"/> Rather than the team having to withstand scrutiny while buying tickets, Taylor's wife bought three sets of plane tickets from three different airlines ahead of time, without any issues.<ref name=\"Macleans\"/><ref name=\"KnelmanTorStar2\"/>
* The film depicts a dramatic last-minute cancellation of the mission by the Carter administration and Mendez declaring he will proceed with the mission.

===Other inaccuracies===
The film contains other historical inaccuracies:
* The screenplay has the escapees—Mark and Cora Lijek, Bob Anders, Lee Schatz, and Joe and Kathy Stafford—settling down to enforced cohabitation at the residence of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. In reality, after several nights, the group was split between the Taylor house and the home of another Canadian official, [[John Sheardown]] and his wife [[Zena Sheardown]].<ref name=\"BBC News - Argo\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=John Sheardown, Canadian Who Sheltered Americans in Tehran, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/americas/john-sheardown-canadian-who-sheltered-americans-in-tehran-dies-at-88.html|accessdate=February 24, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 4, 2013}}</ref>
* \"It's not true we could never go outside. John Sheardown's house had an interior courtyard with a garden and we could walk there freely,\" Mark Lijek says.<ref name=\"BBC News - Argo\"/>
* Lester Siegel, played by [[Alan Arkin]], is not a real person.

* In the depiction of a frantic effort by CIA headquarters, in Langley, to get President Jimmy Carter to re-authorize the mission so that previously purchased airline tickets would still be valid, a CIA officer is portrayed as getting the [[White House]] telephone operator to connect him to Chief of Staff [[Hamilton Jordan]] by impersonating a representative of the school attended by Jordan's children.

* The film depicts Mendez discovering the script with the title of ''Argo''. In reality the script was titled ''Lord of Light'', based on the [[Lord of Light|book of the same name]] by [[Roger Zelazny]]. The CIA changed the title to ''Argo.''<ref name=\"Bearman\"/><ref name=\"Higgins\">Higgins, Bill; Kit, Borys. \"Argo's odd Hollywood history.\" ''Hollywood Reporter''. October 5, 2012: 64. eLibrary.

* The [[Hollywood Sign]] is shown dilapidated as it had been in the 1970s.

* The [[Swissair]] flight that took Mendez and the hostage group out of Tehran is shown operated with a [[Boeing 747]]-300, a type which entered service in 1983, and is painted in a livery that Swissair introduced in 1980. In real life, the group departed Iran on a Swissair [[Douglas DC-8]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.askthepilot.com/argo-gets-it-wrong/ |title=\"Argo\" and the 747 |newspaper=Askthepilot.com |date=March 1, 2013 |author=Patrick Smith |accessdate= August 17, 2015}}</ref>

The film, starring Affleck as Mendez, and [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Alan Arkin]], and [[John Goodman]] in supporting roles, was released in the United States on October 12, 2012. It was produced by [[Grant Heslov]], Affleck and [[George Clooney]].

''Argo'' was praised for the acting (particularly Arkin and Goodman's), Affleck's direction, Terrio's screenplay, the editing, and Desplat's score. The film received seven nominations at the [[85th Academy Awards]] and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film also earned five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations: it won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture]] for Alan Arkin. It won [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[19th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and Arkin was nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]]. It also won [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]] at the [[66th British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Hochi Film Award|37th Hochi Film Award]] for Best International Picture.

Despite its praise, ''Argo'' has been criticized for some specific inaccuracies, in particular for minimizing the role of the Canadian embassy in the rescue, for falsely showing that the Americans were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies, and for exaggerating the danger the group faced during events preceding their escape from the country.

== Plot ==
On November 4, 1979, Iranian [[Islamism|Islamists]] storm the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|United States embassy in Tehran]] in retaliation for President [[Jimmy Carter]] giving the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] asylum in the U.S. during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Sixty of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] begins to explore options for [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] them from Iran. [[Tony Mendez]], a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] exfiltration specialist, is brought in for a consultation. He criticizes the proposals but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching [[Battle for the Planet of the Apes|''Battle for the Planet of the Apes'']] and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees: that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film.

Mendez contacts [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]], a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing ''Argo'', a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and finally realize that some personnel are unaccounted for.

Posing as a producer for ''Argo'', Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with [[Canadian passports]] and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|bazaar]] to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when they are harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd.

Mendez is told that the operation has been canceled to avoid conflicting with a [[Operation Eagle Claw|planned military rescue of the hostages]]. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and confirm their tickets on a [[Swissair]] flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' ticket reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and the head guard's call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. The group boards the airliner, which takes off just as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] at the airport are informed of the ruse and try to stop them.

To protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed, and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador (who shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife as the operation is underway). The ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]. Mendez is awarded the [[Intelligence Star]], but due to the mission's classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterward. The award is restored to him after the [[Canadian Caper]] is declassified in 1997.

==Production==
''Argo'' is based on the \"Canadian Caper\" that took place during the [[Iran hostage crisis]] in 1979 and 1980. [[Chris Terrio]] wrote the screenplay based on Joshuah Bearman's 2007 article \"How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran,\" which was published in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref name=\"Bearman\"/>

In 2007, the producers [[George Clooney]], [[Grant Heslov]] and [[David Klawans]] set up a project based on the article. Affleck's participation was announced in February 2011.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McNary |first=Dave |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031570 |title=Affleck in talks to direct 'Argo' |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109035540/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031570 |archivedate=November 9, 2012 }}</ref> The following June, Alan Arkin was the first person cast in the film.<ref name=\"First\">{{cite journal|last=Sneider |first=Jeff |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038411 |title=Alan Arkin first to board 'Argo' |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109035626/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038411 |archivedate=November 9, 2012 }}</ref> After the rest of the roles were cast, filming began in [[Los Angeles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmapia.com/published/scenes?placeId=1825&movie=argo|title=Scenes from 'Argo' shot in 'Los Angeles'|publisher=filmapia|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}</ref> in August 2011.

As a historical piece, the film made use of archival news footage from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]; and included popular songs from the era, such as \"[[Little T&A]]\" by [[The Rolling Stones]] (an anachronism, as it was not released until the following year), \"[[Sultans of Swing]]\" by [[Dire Straits]], \"[[Dance the Night Away (Van Halen song)|Dance the Night Away]]\" by [[Van Halen]] and \"[[When the Levee Breaks]]\" by [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref>[http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/argo Argo (2012) – Soundtrack.net]</ref> For its part, Warner Bros. used its 1972–1984 title featuring the \"Big W\" logo designed by [[Saul Bass]] for [[Warner Communications]] to open the film and painted on its studio lot's famed water tower the logo of The Burbank Studios (the facility's name during the 1970s and 1980s when Warner shared it with [[Columbia Pictures]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haithman | first=Diane |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/oscars-argo-production-design/|title=OSCARS: Re-Creating The Look Of The '70s For 'Argo'|journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 31, 2012}}</ref>

The screenplay used by the CIA to create their cover story was an adaptation of [[Roger Zelazny]]'s 1967 novel ''[[Lord of Light]]''.  Producer Barry Geller had spearheaded an earlier attempt to produce the film using the original title. After that production attempt failed, the screenplay was renamed ''Argo'' and used by the CIA.<ref name=\"Bearman\"/><ref>{{cite web | last1=Higgins | first1=Bill | last2=Kit | first2=Borys |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ben-affleck-argo-odd-hollywood-history-374054| title=The Odd Hollywood History Behind Ben Affleck's 'Argo' | work=Hollywood Reporter | date=September 26, 2012 | accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref>

According to Tony Mendez, Studio Six—the phony Hollywood production office he helped create at the core of the CIA plan—proved so convincing that even weeks after the rescue was complete and the office had folded, 26 scripts were delivered to its address, including one from [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref name=Lane>{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=Anthony|title=Film Within A Film|journal=The New Yorker|date=October 15, 2012|page=99|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2012/10/15/121015crci_cinema_lane|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref>

[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 96%, based on 351 reviews, with an [[weighted mean|average]] rating of 8.39/10.

Naming ''Argo'' one of the best 11 films of 2012, critic [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"Ben Affleck's seamless direction catapults him to the forefront of Hollywood filmmakers turning out thoughtful entertainment.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=The Year of the Body Vulnerable|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/movies/lincoln-and-amour-top-stephen-holdens-best-of-list.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2012|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Times]]'' said it felt \"like a movie from an earlier era — less frenetic, less showy, more focused on narrative than sensation,\" but that the script included \"too many characters that he doesn't quite develop.\"<ref>Peter Suderman, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/11/movie-review-argo/ Movie Review: 'Argo'], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', October 11, 2012</ref>

Writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] said, 
{{quote|The craft in this film is rare. It is so easy to manufacture a thriller from chases and gunfire, and so very hard to fine-tune it out of exquisite timing and a plot that's so clear to us we wonder why it isn't obvious to the Iranians. After all, who in their right mind would believe a space opera was being filmed in Iran during the hostage crisis?<ref name=\"ebert\" />}}Ebert gave the film 4/4 stars, calling it \"spellbinding\" and \"surprisingly funny,\" and chose it as the best film of the year, the last film he would choose for this honor before his death in 2013.<ref name=ebert>Ebert, Roger (10 October 2012).

Literary critic [[Stanley Fish]] says that the film is a standard [[caper film]] in which \"some improbable task has to be pulled off by a combination of ingenuity, training, deception and luck.\" He goes on to describe the film's structure: \"(1) the presentation of the scheme to reluctant and unimaginative superiors, (2) the transformation of a ragtag bunch of ne'er-do-wells and wackos into a coherent, coordinated unit and (3) the carrying out of the task.\"<ref name=\"fish\"/>

Although he thinks the film is good at building and sustaining suspense, he concludes,
{{quote|This is one of those movies that depend on your not thinking much about it; for as soon as you reflect on what's happening rather than being swept up in the narrative flow, there doesn't seem much to it aside from the skill with which suspense is maintained despite the fact that you know in advance how it's going to turn out. ...

Bootleg DVDs have become popular and are estimated at \"several hundreds of thousands\" of copies. Interpretations of the film's popularity in Iran have varied, ranging from the fact that the movie portrays the excesses of the revolution and the hostage crisis, which had been long glorified in Iran, to Iranians viewing it as a reminder of what caused the poor relations with America and the ensuing cost to Iran, decades after the embassy takeover.<ref name=\"Kamali\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2012/nov/13/argo-iranians-ben-affleck|title=Why Argo is hard for Iranians to watch|author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan|date=November 13, 2012|work=The Guardian|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}</ref> The high DVD sales suggests a form of silent protest against the government's ongoing hostility to relations with America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578263610160724572|title=Iran's Latest Hit: Bootleg 'Argo' DVDs|last=Fassihi|first=Farnaz|date=February 1, 2013|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref>

[[File:ThanksCanada.JPG|thumb|right|People welcoming the six American diplomats back to the United States and expressing thanks to Canada, 1980]]

In a CNN interview, former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] addressed the controversy: 
{{quote|90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan was Canadian. And the movie gives almost full credit to the American CIA. And with that exception, the movie is very good. But Ben Affleck's character in the film was... only in Tehran a day and a half. And the main hero, in my opinion, was [[Kenneth D.

But I realize this is a movie and you have to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.\"<ref name=KnelmanTorStar2 /> In the film, Taylor is shown threatening to close the Canadian embassy. This did not happen, and the Canadians never considered abandoning the six Americans who had taken refuge under their protection.<ref name=KnelmanTorStar2 />

Affleck asserted: 
{{quote|Because we say it's based on a true story, rather than this is a true story, we're allowed to take some dramatic license. There's a spirit of truth .... the kinds of things that are really important to be true are—for example, the relationship between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. stood up collectively as a nation and said, \"We like you, we appreciate you, we respect you, and we're in your debt.\"... There were folks who didn't want to stick their necks out and the Canadians did. They said, \"We'll risk our diplomatic standing, our lives, by harbouring six Americans because it's the right thing to do.\"  Because of that, their lives were saved.\"<ref name=Macleans />}}

===British and New Zealand roles===
Upon its release in October 2012, the film was criticized for its suggestion that [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[New Zealand]] embassies had turned away the American refugees in Tehran. Neither the British nor the New Zealand embassies had turned the refugees away. Both embassies, along with the Canadians, helped them. The British took immense risks,{{cn|date=April 2020}} having initially hosted the American refugees. However, the location was deemed unsafe as the British embassy itself had been targeted and surrounded by mobs and all involved officials from the various nations believed the Canadian ambassador's residence to be a safer location. New Zealand diplomatic ambassadors also took huge risks: organizing a place for the refugees to hide if they needed to change their location,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Opinion-Ben-Affleck-must-apologise-to-NZ-for-Argos-deception/tabid/1382/articleID/288296/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title=Opinion: Ben Affleck must apologise to NZ for Argo's deception |date=February 27, 2013}}</ref> and driving the Americans to the airport when they made their escape from Tehran.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/NZs-role-in-Iran-crisis-tainted-in-Afflecks-film-Argo/tabid/418/articleID/273069/Default.aspx |title=NZ's role in Iran crisis tainted in Affleck's film 'Argo' – Story – Entertainment |work=3 News |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref> British diplomats also assisted other American hostages beyond the escaped group of six.<ref>{{cite web|author=Film |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/9622647/Ben-Afflecks-new-film-Argo-upsets-British-diplomats-who-helped-Americans-in-Iran.html |title=Ben Affleck's new film 'Argo' upsets British diplomats who helped Americans in Iran |work=Telegraph|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref> Bob Anders, the U.S. consular agent played in the film by [[Tate Donovan]], said, \"They put their lives on the line for us.

[[Sir John Graham, 4th Baronet|Sir John Graham]], the then-[[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Iran|British ambassador to Iran]], said, 
{{quote|My immediate reaction on hearing about this was one of outrage. I have since simmered down, but am still very distressed that the film-makers should have got it so wrong. My concern is that the inaccurate account should not enter the mythology of the events in Tehran in November 1979.\"<ref name = \"Telegraph UK review\"/>}} The then-British [[chargé d'affaires]] in Tehran said that, had the Americans been discovered in the British embassy, \"I can assure you we'd all have been for the high jump.\"<ref name = \"Telegraph UK review\"/> [[Martin Williams (diplomat)|Martin Williams]], secretary to Sir John Graham in Iran at the time, was the one who found the Americans, after searching for them in his own British car (the only [[Austin Maxi]] in Iran) and first sheltered them in his own house.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

Affleck is quoted as saying to ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'': \"I struggled with this long and hard, because it casts Britain and New Zealand in a way that is not totally fair. But I was setting up a situation where you needed to get a sense that these six people had nowhere else to go. It does not mean to diminish anyone.\"<ref name = \"Telegraph UK review\" />
On March 12, 2013, the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] censured Affleck by  unanimously agreeing to the following motion, initiated by [[New Zealand First]] leader [[Winston Peters]]:
{{quote|... this House acknowledge[s] with gratitude the efforts of former New Zealand diplomats Chris Beeby and Richard Sewell in assisting American hostages in Tehran during the hostage crisis in 1979, and express[es] its regret that the director of the movie'' Argo ''saw fit to mislead the world about what actually happened during that crisis when, in reality, our courageous diplomats' inspirational actions were of significant help to the American hostages and deserve the factual and historical record to be corrected.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/document/50HansD_20130312_00000008/motions-human-rights-fiji-treatment-of-detainees-iran |title=Motions—Iran Hostage Crisis—Fictional Representation of Role of New Zealand Diplomats|publisher=Hansard Office, New Zealand Parliament|date= March 12, 2013|accessdate=March 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/movie-argo-misled-the-world/story-e6frf7k6-1226595680820|title=Movie Argo 'misled the world'|work=Herald Sun|date=March 12, 2013 |accessdate=March 12, 2013}}</ref>}}

===Imminent danger to the group===
In the film, the diplomats face suspicious glances from Iranians whenever they go out in public, and appear close to being caught at many steps along the way to their freedom. In reality, the diplomats never appeared to be in imminent danger.<ref name=\"Macleans\"/><ref name=\"KnelmanTorStar2\"/><ref name=\"BBC News - Argo\"/> Rather than the team having to withstand scrutiny while buying tickets, Taylor's wife bought three sets of plane tickets from three different airlines ahead of time, without any issues.<ref name=\"Macleans\"/><ref name=\"KnelmanTorStar2\"/>
* The film depicts a dramatic last-minute cancellation of the mission by the Carter administration and Mendez declaring he will proceed with the mission.

===Other inaccuracies===
The film contains other historical inaccuracies:
* The screenplay has the escapees—Mark and Cora Lijek, Bob Anders, Lee Schatz, and Joe and Kathy Stafford—settling down to enforced cohabitation at the residence of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. In reality, after several nights, the group was split between the Taylor house and the home of another Canadian official, [[John Sheardown]] and his wife [[Zena Sheardown]].<ref name=\"BBC News - Argo\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=John Sheardown, Canadian Who Sheltered Americans in Tehran, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/americas/john-sheardown-canadian-who-sheltered-americans-in-tehran-dies-at-88.html|accessdate=February 24, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 4, 2013}}</ref>
* \"It's not true we could never go outside. John Sheardown's house had an interior courtyard with a garden and we could walk there freely,\" Mark Lijek says.<ref name=\"BBC News - Argo\"/>
* Lester Siegel, played by [[Alan Arkin]], is not a real person.

* In the depiction of a frantic effort by CIA headquarters, in Langley, to get President Jimmy Carter to re-authorize the mission so that previously purchased airline tickets would still be valid, a CIA officer is portrayed as getting the [[White House]] telephone operator to connect him to Chief of Staff [[Hamilton Jordan]] by impersonating a representative of the school attended by Jordan's children.

* The [[Swissair]] flight that took Mendez and the hostage group out of Tehran is shown operated with a [[Boeing 747]]-300, a type which entered service in 1983, and is painted in a livery that Swissair introduced in 1980.

\"'''7 Things'''\" is a song by American singer [[Miley Cyrus]]. The song was co-written by Cyrus, [[Antonina Armato]] and [[Tim James (music producer)|Tim James]], and produced by [[John Fields (producer)|John Fields]]. It was released on June 17, 2008 by [[Hollywood Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the first [[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|studio album]] released by Cyrus with no ties to her character [[List of Hannah Montana main characters|Hannah Montana]] from the [[Disney Channel]] comedy series [[Hannah Montana|of the same name]]. Also registered as \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", Cyrus developed the song during the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]] while feeling numerous emotions for an ex-boyfriend, mainly anger. The song's release brought allegations that it was about [[Nick Jonas]] of the [[Jonas Brothers]], which Cyrus neither confirmed nor denied. Musically, \"7 Things\" bears aspects of both [[country music|country]] and [[pop punk]], while the lyrics in the song's refrain list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend.

\"7 Things\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics and enjoyed worldwide commercial success, becoming a top ten hit on charts in Australia, Japan, Norway, and the United States. The single was [[Music recording sales certifications|certified gold]] by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), while its appearance on the [[Japan Hot 100]] made \"7 Things\" Cyrus' first song to chart in an Asian country. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Brett Ratner]] and features Cyrus performing the song with a back-up band as many teenage girls lipsync along. The girls clutch a variety of props, such as [[love letter]]s and [[snow globe]]s, inspired by personal items Cyrus' ex had given her. The video was nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award]] at both the 2008 and 2009 award shows.

The song's lyrics are written in [[second person narrative|second person]], a message from the singer to her ex-boyfriend detailing the hurt he caused her while they were dating. The refrain is a list of the seven traits the singer \"hates\" most about her ex, with the seventh item being her frustration that despite his flaws, he makes her love him.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Ben Ratliff of ''The New York Times'' noted that the list actually \"runs to 8 to 11 things, depending on how you parse it\".<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> Henry Freedland of ''Paste'' magazine compared it to a similar list featured as a poem in the 1999 film ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''.<ref name=\"paste\" /> In one verse, Cyrus asks for a sincere apology and states, \"If you [[Text message|text]] it, I'll delete it\", which Molly Lambert of ''The New York Times'' said \"perfectly captur[es] our confusing age of technologically mediated courtship.\"<ref name=\"lambert\" /> The song concludes with a variation of the refrain, in which Cyrus names the seven things she likes the most about her ex, again concluding with \"you make me love you\".<ref name=\"nytimes\" />

For example, the necklace Cyrus wears in the video was her ex-boyfriend's [[medical identification tag]], which he received because of his [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=\"7video\" />

The video was shot on May 30, 2008 in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Unexpectedly, several girls began crying during the shoot; Cyrus attributed this to the emotions in the song.<ref name=\"onair\" /> Ratner was impressed with Cyrus' instinct and ability to address emotional issues while making them \"fun at the same time\".<ref name=\"people\" /> Ratner compared her to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], saying, \"she can be hanging out and laughing, and then you put the camera on her and it's like, 'Holy shit!'\"<ref name=\"7video\" /> The effervescence made editing more difficult for the director.<ref name=\"7video\" /> He said, \"It was the hardest video I've ever edited because every moment was great. Every moment that she was on camera, she was amazing. She's got an incredible quality about her. She gets the camera, and that's what it takes to make a great music video.\"<ref name=\"7video\" /> Cyrus commented that she felt the video was \"more honest than [the] song\" and that she was \"singing out to [...] that special person\".<ref name=\"onair\" />

The video commences with a [[close-up|close-up shots]] of Cyrus' face as she counts in the backup band behind her.

Her wavy hair styled loose and in front of her shoulders. As Cyrus continues to sing, she is replaced by more girls holding different items, including [[teddy bears]], stuffed animals, [[snow globes]], and love letters. As the song approaches its chorus, Cyrus and the girls start dancing and jumping. Cyrus continues singing as she holds a [[white rose]] and a girl deletes a [[text message]] from her boyfriend. At one point, Cyrus holds a photograph of her and an ex-boyfriend with black curly hair, his face obscured by a [[doodle]] on a piece of notebook paper. At the end of the video, Cyrus blows the camera a kiss, mouths \"I love you,\" and turns away.

\"'''7 Things'''\" is a song by American singer [[Miley Cyrus]]. The song was co-written by Cyrus, [[Antonina Armato]] and [[Tim James (music producer)|Tim James]], and produced by [[John Fields (producer)|John Fields]]. It was released on June 17, 2008 by [[Hollywood Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the first [[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|studio album]] released by Cyrus with no ties to her character [[List of Hannah Montana main characters|Hannah Montana]] from the [[Disney Channel]] comedy series [[Hannah Montana|of the same name]]. Also registered as \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", Cyrus developed the song during the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]] while feeling numerous emotions for an ex-boyfriend, mainly anger. The song's release brought allegations that it was about [[Nick Jonas]] of the [[Jonas Brothers]], which Cyrus neither confirmed nor denied. Musically, \"7 Things\" bears aspects of both [[country music|country]] and [[pop punk]], while the lyrics in the song's refrain list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend.

\"7 Things\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics and enjoyed worldwide commercial success, becoming a top ten hit on charts in Australia, Japan, Norway, and the United States. The single was [[Music recording sales certifications|certified gold]] by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), while its appearance on the [[Japan Hot 100]] made \"7 Things\" Cyrus' first song to chart in an Asian country. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Brett Ratner]] and features Cyrus performing the song with a back-up band as many teenage girls lipsync along. The girls clutch a variety of props, such as [[love letter]]s and [[snow globe]]s, inspired by personal items Cyrus' ex had given her. The video was nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award]] at both the 2008 and 2009 award shows. Cyrus promoted the song through several venues including her world tours, the [[Wonder World Tour (Miley Cyrus)|Wonder World Tour]] and the [[Gypsy Heart Tour]].

The song's lyrics are written in [[second person narrative|second person]], a message from the singer to her ex-boyfriend detailing the hurt he caused her while they were dating.

For example, the necklace Cyrus wears in the video was her ex-boyfriend's [[medical identification tag]], which he received because of his [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=\"7video\" />

The video was shot on May 30, 2008 in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Unexpectedly, several girls began crying during the shoot; Cyrus attributed this to the emotions in the song.<ref name=\"onair\" /> Ratner was impressed with Cyrus' instinct and ability to address emotional issues while making them \"fun at the same time\".<ref name=\"people\" /> Ratner compared her to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], saying, \"she can be hanging out and laughing, and then you put the camera on her and it's like, 'Holy shit!'\"<ref name=\"7video\" /> The effervescence made editing more difficult for the director.<ref name=\"7video\" /> He said, \"It was the hardest video I've ever edited because every moment was great. Every moment that she was on camera, she was amazing. She's got an incredible quality about her. She gets the camera, and that's what it takes to make a great music video.\"<ref name=\"7video\" /> Cyrus commented that she felt the video was \"more honest than [the] song\" and that she was \"singing out to [...] that special person\".<ref name=\"onair\" />

The video commences with a [[close-up|close-up shots]] of Cyrus' face as she counts in the backup band behind her.

As the song approaches its chorus, Cyrus and the girls start dancing and jumping. Cyrus continues singing as she holds a [[white rose]] and a girl deletes a [[text message]] from her boyfriend. At one point, Cyrus holds a photograph of her and an ex-boyfriend with black curly hair, his face obscured by a [[doodle]] on a piece of notebook paper. At the end of the video, Cyrus blows the camera a kiss, mouths \"I love you,\" and turns away.

\"'''The Man'''\" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. The song was serviced to US [[Hot adult contemporary|adult contemporary]] and [[Contemporary hit radio|pop]] radio formats on January 27 and 28, 2020 as the fourth single from Swift's seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019)''.'' Swift wrote and produced the song with [[Joel Little]]. It is a [[synth-pop]] song which features flashy harmonies and murky synths. Over an uptempo production, Swift imagines the media's treatment of her if she were a man. The song received acclaim from critics, who praised its [[feminism|feminist]] message.

\"The Man\" peaked at number 23 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the fourth consecutive single from ''Lover'' to peak inside the top 40 of the chart. It also debuted at number 4 on the [[Rolling Stone Top 100|''Rolling Stone'' Top 100]]. It entered the top 40 on charts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. On February 7, 2020, an animated lyric video of the song was released on [[YouTube]]. On February 18, 2020, a live acoustic version of the song, titled \"The Man (Live from Paris)\", was released on all music platforms, accompanied by its live video.

An official music video for \"The Man\" was released on February 27, 2020 and was directed by Swift herself, marking her solo directorial debut. The [[Satire|satirical]] video sees Swift in her theoretical male alter-ego named \"Tyler Swift\", presenting several prevalent examples of [[Sexism|sexist]] double standards in society, including [[Sexual objectification|objectification]], [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]] and [[patriarchy]].

She stated that the entire preparation for the music video—including planning meetings, creating mood boards, scouting locations, and costume and set design—took several months. She also confirmed that there would be many of her trademark \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" in the video.

=== Synopsis and analysis ===
The [[Satire|satirical]] music video explores Swift's life as her theoretical male counterpart, an [[Alter ego|alter-ego]] named \"Tyler Swift\". The video presents numerous prevalent examples of double standards in society, and comments on the [[Sexual objectification|objectification]] and [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]], [[patriarchy]], as well as performative allyship. Throughout the video, the male version of Swift is seen rudely inconveniencing the people around him, leading a luxurious and promiscuous lifestyle, [[manspreading]], receiving praise for the bare minimum, and throwing [[tantrum]]s without consequences. It contains visual references to ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', a film involving the lyrically name-checked actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and cinematographer Prieto, and tennis player [[Serena Williams]]' match controversy with a chair umpire at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open Championships]].<ref name=\":1\" />

[[File:Tyler Swift manspreading.jpeg|thumb|Swift's male alter-ego, Tyler Swift (in the middle), [[manspreading]] in a metro train.|alt=Man smiling]]

The video has several easter eggs alluding to Swift's other work, including ''[[Speak Now]]'', ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'', ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' and ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' graffiti on a wall. ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' is written backwards, while the title of her [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut album]] appears in a sign saying \"Missing: If Found Return to Taylor Swift\". The \"missing\" sign, along with another wordless sign that appears to ban riding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], references her battle with [[Scooter Braun]] and [[Big Machine Records]] over the ownership of the master recordings of her first six studio albums. ''Lover'', the first album that Swift completely owns herself, is absent, but the word \"karma\" is written twice on the wall, a possible reference to Swift's plan to re-record her previous works thus lowering the value of the originals. The camera subsequently pans over a \"Mr. Americana\" poster for a film starring Tyler Swift, directed by Larry Wilson, and premiering at the 2020 Mandance Festival, a [[word play]] on Swift's [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' directed by [[Lana Wilson]], which debuted at the [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]]. Swift's alter-ego runs down a hallway giving high-fives to nineteen disembodied hands, alluding to double standards behind the [[walk of shame]] that women are often forced to take after a sexual encounter. The hands are said to be a reference to the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment of the United States constitution]], which granted women the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|right to vote]] in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-hidden-details|title=Taylor Swift Just Unveiled Her Self-Directed Music Video For \"The Man\" And It's Full Of Hidden Details|last=Bate|first=Ellie|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>

In the final scene, Swift herself appears as the video's director to instruct her male alter-ego to be both \"sexier\" and \"more likeable\" in the next take—a subtle dig at the entertainment industry's blatant objectification of and sexist treatment toward women. Ending on messages of female empowerment, Swift then turns to praise Loren Gray for her acting performance as a tennis [[ball boy|ball girl]], despite her role consisting of nothing more than an [[eye-rolling|eye roll]]. The end credits list Swift as the director, writer, owner and star of the music video, Johnson as the voice of \"The Man\", and shows photos of Swift's transformation process into the male lead of the video. It ends with a [[disclaimer]] stating \"No men were harmed in the making of this video\".<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-dwayne-johnson-watch.html|title=Taylor Swift Is an Independent Woman Who Didn't Need a Man for 'The Man' Video|last=Haylock|first=Zoe|date=2020-02-27|website=Vulture|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>

=== Critical reception ===
The video received critical acclaim upon release, with many commentators complimenting the video's concept and Swift's \"unrecognizable\" transformation into the male alter-ego.

Bryan Rolli of ''[[Forbes]]'', highlighted that the video is characterized by an \"exaggerated and [[cartoon]]ish\" attitude \"in a [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] way\", typical of Swift's \"most memorable videos\". He further expanded that \"obviously, not every man acts like her [Swift's] character; that's not the point. The point is to make a caricature of the buffoonish men who feel the need to criticize successful women like Swift for merely existing and dissect every public decision they make, whereas their male counterparts would receive praise for the same actions\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2020/02/28/taylor-swifts-the-man-is-the-single-and-video-lover-deserved/|title=Taylor Swift's 'The Man' Is The Single (And Video) 'Lover' Deserved|last=Rolli|first=Bryan|website=Forbes|language=en|date=February 28, 2020|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref> Avery Blank, also writing for ''Forbes'', opined that the video is a \"reminder that women continue to face challenges when it comes to owning their ideas and maintaining control over their own careers\" and that the society \"expects women to be team players and not worry about getting credit for their work\".

==Lyric video==
An [[Animation|animated]] lyric video for the song was released on February 7, 2020, exploring visual themes of women empowerment, feminism and [[occupational sexism|workplace sexism]].

[[File:Impossible staircase.svg|right|thumb|[[Penrose stairs]] are incorporated into the lyric video to portray the never-ending difficulties faced by women in the corporate world.|alt=A staircase in a square format. The stairs make four 90-degree turns in each corner, so they are in the format of a continuous loop.]]

The video depicts a [[power dressing|power suit]]-wearing woman, the only female figure in a maze-like city full of taller and larger [[corporatism|corporate]] male drones, as she tries to navigate through [[Penrose stairs|staircases that lead to nowhere]]. She is forced to run past the sauntering men to avoid getting trampled. When the woman finally reaches the top of a building, symbolizing her climb up the corporate ladder, the male drones push her off and leave her to freefall to death; thankfully, she is caught by another, benevolent, giant woman and shown to a place where all the women walk together in solidarity towards the city. The ending of the video implies that the true key to success for women is to lift each other up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/taylor-swift-confronts-sexism-animated-182931790.html|title=Taylor Swift Confronts Sexism in Animated 'The Man' Lyric Video|website=news.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-the-man-lyric-video-949495/|title=Taylor Swift Confronts Sexism in Animated 'The Man' Lyric Video|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|date=February 7, 2020|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/taylor-swifts-the-man-lyric-video-takes-on-workplace-sexism-21787166|title=Taylor Swift's \"The Man\" Lyric Video Takes On Workplace Sexism|last=Garrison|first=Cianna|date=February 8, 2020|magazine=[[Elite Daily]]|access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref>

Public figures such as [[Malala Yousafzai]] and [[Kristin Chenoweth]] added the song to their International Women's Day playlists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/starbucks-international-womens-day-celebrations-include-a-spotify-playlist-from-malala-yousafzai-16822387|title=Starbucks' International Women's Day Celebrations Include A Spotify Playlist From Malala Yousafzai|last=Lord|first=Emma|website=Bustle|language=en|date=March 9, 2019|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref> Furthermore, Swift included the song in her Apple Music \"Playlist by ME!\", which was updated to spotlight songs from rising female artists such as [[Beabadoobee]], [[Clairo]], [[Phoebe Bridgers]], [[Caroline Polachek]], [[Celeste (singer)|Celeste]], [[Charli XCX]], [[Daya (singer)|Daya]], [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], [[Haim (band)|Haim]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Léon (Swedish singer)|Léon]], [[H.E.R.]], [[Kesha]], [[King Princess]], [[Marina Diamandis]], [[Muna (band)|MUNA]], [[Oh Wonder]], [[Brittany Howard]], [[Margaret Glaspy]], [[Princess Nokia]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Låpsley]], [[Yebba]] etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9330741/taylor-swift-international-womens-day-playlist|title=Taylor Swift&#39;s International Women&#39;s Day Playlist: Listen|last=Rowley|first=Glenn|date=March 9, 2020|website=Billboard|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>

In March 2020, British politician [[Liz Truss]], the [[Secretary of State for International Trade]] and [[Minister for Women and Equalities]] of the United Kingdom, quoted the song's lyrics during a special International Women's Day debate in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]], while talking about the need for [[gender equality]] across the workforce and greater protection for women against [[domestic violence]]. Truss stated: \"And so that, in the words of the brilliant Taylor Swift in her new song, 'women are left running as fast as they can, wondering if they'd get there quicker if they were a man'.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/british-politician-quotes-taylor-swift-on-international-womens-day-2020-3|title=A British politician quoted Taylor Swift's 'The Man' during an International Women's Day debate in Parliament|last=Peppin|first=Hayley|website=Insider|language=en|date=March 9, 2020|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>

American journalist [[Jody Rosen]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', listed \"The Man\" as one of the \"25 songs that matter now\". Describing Swift as \"pop's best humblebraggart\", Rosen termed \"The Man\" as a \"sly protest song\", explaining that Swift \"has been pop's top bellyacher, turning a now-familiar set of grievances into great songs\". He added that Swift \"channels that indignation into a broader protest against the sexism and skepticism that all women face\". Rosen also opined that the song's \"most hard-hitting line is a plaintive rhetorical question that calls to mind a [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]] slogan: [[Believe women|#BelieveWomen]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jody|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/magazine/best-songs.html|title=25 Songs That Matter Now|date=March 12, 2020|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 16, 2020|url-status=live|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Naming \"The Man\" as the \"most important\" song Swift has ever written, Brittany Hodak of ''[[Forbes]]'', commended that \"the magic of \"The Man\" is not just that it captures a complex (and often misunderstood) issue so brilliantly and simply, but also that it conveys to Swift's female fans that even she isn't above the BS that so many of us are regularly subjected to\". Hodak concluded that she is \"hopeful that Swift’s spotlight on the issue will spark a national conversation about [[sexism]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], and equality\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanyhodak/2019/08/23/lover-offers-the-most-important-song-taylor-swift-has-ever-written/|title=Why 'Lover' Track 'The Man' Is The Most Important Song Taylor Swift Has Ever Written|last=Hodak|first=Brittany|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

Swift wrote and produced the song with [[Joel Little]]. It is a [[synth-pop]] song which features flashy harmonies and murky synths.

\"The Man\" peaked at number 23 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the fourth consecutive single from ''Lover'' to peak inside the top 40 of the chart. It also debuted at number 4 on the [[Rolling Stone Top 100|''Rolling Stone'' Top 100]].

On February 18, 2020, a live acoustic version of the song, titled \"The Man (Live from Paris)\", was released on all music platforms, accompanied by its live video.

An official music video for \"The Man\" was released on February 27, 2020 and was directed by Swift herself, marking her solo directorial debut.

==Critical reception==
\"The Man\" received critical acclaim upon release, with praise towards its lyrics about [[sexism]] and [[women empowerment]].

She stated that the entire preparation for the music video—including planning meetings, creating mood boards, scouting locations, and costume and set design—took several months. She also confirmed that there would be many of her trademark \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" in the video.

=== Synopsis and analysis ===
The [[Satire|satirical]] music video explores Swift's life as her theoretical male counterpart, an [[Alter ego|alter-ego]] named \"Tyler Swift\". The video presents numerous prevalent examples of double standards in society, and comments on the [[Sexual objectification|objectification]] and [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]], [[patriarchy]], as well as performative allyship. Throughout the video, the male version of Swift is seen rudely inconveniencing the people around him, leading a luxurious and promiscuous lifestyle, [[manspreading]], receiving praise for the bare minimum, and throwing [[tantrum]]s without consequences. It contains visual references to ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', a film involving the lyrically name-checked actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and cinematographer Prieto, and tennis player [[Serena Williams]]' match controversy with a chair umpire at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open Championships]].<ref name=\":1\" />

[[File:Tyler Swift manspreading.jpeg|thumb|Swift's male alter-ego, Tyler Swift (in the middle), [[manspreading]] in a metro train.|alt=Man smiling]]

The video has several easter eggs alluding to Swift's other work, including ''[[Speak Now]]'', ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'', ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' and ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' graffiti on a wall. ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' is written backwards, while the title of her [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut album]] appears in a sign saying \"Missing: If Found Return to Taylor Swift\". The \"missing\" sign, along with another wordless sign that appears to ban riding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], references her battle with [[Scooter Braun]] and [[Big Machine Records]] over the ownership of the master recordings of her first six studio albums. ''Lover'', the first album that Swift completely owns herself, is absent, but the word \"karma\" is written twice on the wall, a possible reference to Swift's plan to re-record her previous works thus lowering the value of the originals. The camera subsequently pans over a \"Mr. Americana\" poster for a film starring Tyler Swift, directed by Larry Wilson, and premiering at the 2020 Mandance Festival, a [[word play]] on Swift's [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' directed by [[Lana Wilson]], which debuted at the [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]]. Swift's alter-ego runs down a hallway giving high-fives to nineteen disembodied hands, alluding to double standards behind the [[walk of shame]] that women are often forced to take after a sexual encounter. The hands are said to be a reference to the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment of the United States constitution]], which granted women the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|right to vote]] in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-hidden-details|title=Taylor Swift Just Unveiled Her Self-Directed Music Video For \"The Man\" And It's Full Of Hidden Details|last=Bate|first=Ellie|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>

In the final scene, Swift herself appears as the video's director to instruct her male alter-ego to be both \"sexier\" and \"more likeable\" in the next take—a subtle dig at the entertainment industry's blatant objectification of and sexist treatment toward women. Ending on messages of female empowerment, Swift then turns to praise Loren Gray for her acting performance as a tennis [[ball boy|ball girl]], despite her role consisting of nothing more than an [[eye-rolling|eye roll]]. The end credits list Swift as the director, writer, owner and star of the music video, Johnson as the voice of \"The Man\", and shows photos of Swift's transformation process into the male lead of the video. It ends with a [[disclaimer]] stating \"No men were harmed in the making of this video\".<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-dwayne-johnson-watch.html|title=Taylor Swift Is an Independent Woman Who Didn't Need a Man for 'The Man' Video|last=Haylock|first=Zoe|date=2020-02-27|website=Vulture|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>

=== Critical reception ===
The video received critical acclaim upon release, with many commentators complimenting the video's concept and Swift's \"unrecognizable\" transformation into the male alter-ego.

Bryan Rolli of ''[[Forbes]]'', highlighted that the video is characterized by an \"exaggerated and [[cartoon]]ish\" attitude \"in a [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] way\", typical of Swift's \"most memorable videos\". He further expanded that \"obviously, not every man acts like her [Swift's] character; that's not the point. The point is to make a caricature of the buffoonish men who feel the need to criticize successful women like Swift for merely existing and dissect every public decision they make, whereas their male counterparts would receive praise for the same actions\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2020/02/28/taylor-swifts-the-man-is-the-single-and-video-lover-deserved/|title=Taylor Swift's 'The Man' Is The Single (And Video) 'Lover' Deserved|last=Rolli|first=Bryan|website=Forbes|language=en|date=February 28, 2020|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref> Avery Blank, also writing for ''Forbes'', opined that the video is a \"reminder that women continue to face challenges when it comes to owning their ideas and maintaining control over their own careers\" and that the society \"expects women to be team players and not worry about getting credit for their work\".

==Lyric video==
An [[Animation|animated]] lyric video for the song was released on February 7, 2020, exploring visual themes of women empowerment, feminism and [[occupational sexism|workplace sexism]].

[[File:Impossible staircase.svg|right|thumb|[[Penrose stairs]] are incorporated into the lyric video to portray the never-ending difficulties faced by women in the corporate world.|alt=A staircase in a square format. The stairs make four 90-degree turns in each corner, so they are in the format of a continuous loop.]]

The video depicts a [[power dressing|power suit]]-wearing woman, the only female figure in a maze-like city full of taller and larger [[corporatism|corporate]] male drones, as she tries to navigate through [[Penrose stairs|staircases that lead to nowhere]]. She is forced to run past the sauntering men to avoid getting trampled. When the woman finally reaches the top of a building, symbolizing her climb up the corporate ladder, the male drones push her off and leave her to freefall to death; thankfully, she is caught by another, benevolent, giant woman and shown to a place where all the women walk together in solidarity towards the city. The ending of the video implies that the true key to success for women is to lift each other up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/taylor-swift-confronts-sexism-animated-182931790.html|title=Taylor Swift Confronts Sexism in Animated 'The Man' Lyric Video|website=news.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-the-man-lyric-video-949495/|title=Taylor Swift Confronts Sexism in Animated 'The Man' Lyric Video|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|date=February 7, 2020|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/taylor-swifts-the-man-lyric-video-takes-on-workplace-sexism-21787166|title=Taylor Swift's \"The Man\" Lyric Video Takes On Workplace Sexism|last=Garrison|first=Cianna|date=February 8, 2020|magazine=[[Elite Daily]]|access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref>

In honor of [[International Women's Day]] in 2020, \"The Man\" was added to playlists on streaming platforms such as [[Apple Music]], [[Spotify]] and [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]. Public figures such as [[Malala Yousafzai]] and [[Kristin Chenoweth]] added the song to their International Women's Day playlists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/starbucks-international-womens-day-celebrations-include-a-spotify-playlist-from-malala-yousafzai-16822387|title=Starbucks' International Women's Day Celebrations Include A Spotify Playlist From Malala Yousafzai|last=Lord|first=Emma|website=Bustle|language=en|date=March 9, 2019|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref> Furthermore, Swift included the song in her Apple Music \"Playlist by ME!\", which was updated to spotlight songs from rising female artists such as [[Beabadoobee]], [[Clairo]], [[Phoebe Bridgers]], [[Caroline Polachek]], [[Celeste (singer)|Celeste]], [[Charli XCX]], [[Daya (singer)|Daya]], [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], [[Haim (band)|Haim]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Léon (Swedish singer)|Léon]], [[H.E.R.]], [[Kesha]], [[King Princess]], [[Marina Diamandis]], [[Muna (band)|MUNA]], [[Oh Wonder]], [[Brittany Howard]], [[Margaret Glaspy]], [[Princess Nokia]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Låpsley]], [[Yebba]] etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9330741/taylor-swift-international-womens-day-playlist|title=Taylor Swift&#39;s International Women&#39;s Day Playlist: Listen|last=Rowley|first=Glenn|date=March 9, 2020|website=Billboard|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>

In March 2020, British politician [[Liz Truss]], the [[Secretary of State for International Trade]] and [[Minister for Women and Equalities]] of the United Kingdom, quoted the song's lyrics during a special International Women's Day debate in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]], while talking about the need for [[gender equality]] across the workforce and greater protection for women against [[domestic violence]]. Truss stated: \"And so that, in the words of the brilliant Taylor Swift in her new song, 'women are left running as fast as they can, wondering if they'd get there quicker if they were a man'.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/british-politician-quotes-taylor-swift-on-international-womens-day-2020-3|title=A British politician quoted Taylor Swift's 'The Man' during an International Women's Day debate in Parliament|last=Peppin|first=Hayley|website=Insider|language=en|date=March 9, 2020|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>

American journalist [[Jody Rosen]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', listed \"The Man\" as one of the \"25 songs that matter now\". Describing Swift as \"pop's best humblebraggart\", Rosen termed \"The Man\" as a \"sly protest song\", explaining that Swift \"has been pop's top bellyacher, turning a now-familiar set of grievances into great songs\". He added that Swift \"channels that indignation into a broader protest against the sexism and skepticism that all women face\". Rosen also opined that the song's \"most hard-hitting line is a plaintive rhetorical question that calls to mind a [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]] slogan: [[Believe women|#BelieveWomen]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jody|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/magazine/best-songs.html|title=25 Songs That Matter Now|date=March 12, 2020|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 16, 2020|url-status=live|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Naming \"The Man\" as the \"most important\" song Swift has ever written, Brittany Hodak of ''[[Forbes]]'', commended that \"the magic of \"The Man\" is not just that it captures a complex (and often misunderstood) issue so brilliantly and simply, but also that it conveys to Swift's female fans that even she isn't above the BS that so many of us are regularly subjected to\". Hodak concluded that she is \"hopeful that Swift’s spotlight on the issue will spark a national conversation about [[sexism]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], and equality\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanyhodak/2019/08/23/lover-offers-the-most-important-song-taylor-swift-has-ever-written/|title=Why 'Lover' Track 'The Man' Is The Most Important Song Taylor Swift Has Ever Written|last=Hodak|first=Brittany|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

'''William Ronald Dodds Fairbairn''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛər|b|ɛər|n}}) [[FRSE]] (11 August 1889 – 31 December 1964) was a Scottish psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and a central figure in the development of the [[object relations theory]] of psychoanalysis.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Illusion Of Love: Why The Battered Woman Returns To Her Abuser|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0231100373|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>

==Life==
[[File:The Red House, Cluny Gardens.jpg|thumb|Fairbairn's birthplace - The Red House, Cluny Gardens]]

Ronald Fairbairn was born at the Red House, Cluny Gardens,<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90</ref> in [[Morningside, Edinburgh]] in 1889, the only child of Cecilia Leefe and Thomas Fairbairn, a chartered surveyor, and President of the Edinburgh Architectural Association.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40312|title=Fairbairn, (William) Ronald Dodds (1889–1964), psychiatrist and psychoanalyst|last=|first=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40312}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he studied for three years in [[divinity]] and [[Hellenic Greek]] studies, graduating MA in 1911.

In the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Royal Engineers]] and served under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestinian campaign]], and then the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].

On his return to home he began medical training, probably inspired by his war experience. He received a doctorate in Medicine (MD) on 30 March 1929 from the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"Archive\">Available at the [https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/9999 Edinburgh Research Archive].</ref> From 1927 to 1935 he lectured in psychology at the University and also independently practised analysis. From 1941 until 1954 he was Consultant Psychiatrist to the [[Ministry of Pensions]].<ref name=\":1\" />

In 1931 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[James Drever]], [[Edwin Bramwell]], Sir Godfrey Hilton Thomson and [[Robert Alexander Fleming]].

On the basis of his writings he became an associate member of the British Psychoanalytical Society in 1931, becoming a full member in 1939. Fairbairn, though somewhat isolated in that he spent his entire career in Edinburgh,<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Charles Rycroft|last=Rycroft|first=Charles | title=Psychoanalysis and after | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=132}}</ref> had a profound influence on British Object Relations and the relational schools. Fairbairn was one of the theory-builders for the [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|Middle Group]]<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=21}}</ref> (now called the Independent Group) psychoanalysts. The Independent Group contained analysts who identified with neither the [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]ians nor the [[Anna Freud]]ians. They were more concerned with the relationships between people than with the \"drives\" within them.

He died in Edinburgh at the age of 75. He is buried with his wives in [[Dean Cemetery]] in western [[Edinburgh]]. The grave lies very close to the main east entrance and lodge-house.

==Family==

In 1926 Fairbairn married Mary Ann More Gordon (1901–1952) the daughter of Harry More Gordon. Their daughter Ellinor was born in 1927, followed by twins in 1928, however they did not survive. Their fourth child was born in 1929, and in 1933 their fifth son [[Nicholas Fairbairn|Nicholas]] was born, who would go on to become a barrister and MP.<ref name=\":0\" />

In 1959 he married Marion Frances Mackintosh (1907–1995), daughter of Captain H. E. M. Archer.<ref name=\":0\" />

===''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'' (1952)===

The importance of Fairbain's work lies in its direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. 

Fairbairn's model is  classified as psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models—the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious—as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. 

Greenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn.  
<blockquote>
In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>
The psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id—Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives—is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures—Id, Ego, and Super Ego—mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. 

In contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairburn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>
Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. … At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     
</blockquote>
Over time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.

===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====

In his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics. <blockquote>
… (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.… So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>
The more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:
<blockquote>
Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> 
</blockquote>
Fairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment, and that  that the intolerable-to accept parental failures force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. 

Typically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>
It is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    
</blockquote>
Simply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.

===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====
Fairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of  \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.
Fairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>
Thus, the developmental proceeds, the child gradually realizes that is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>
The greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>
Thus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  

The unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the antilibidinal ego ad he rejecting object in the splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   

Secondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has been validated by the  millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. 

Fairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individual who either live at home with their ageing parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   

===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====
Fairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues.  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought , is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation which was to search for a good object and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's\"challenge\" of the Freudian model was not a problem for the analytic community despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book in 1983,<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love,help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world  and simultaneously forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individuals life.     

Once these \"bad-object\" memories are dissociated and repressed they become the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second and third points in this quote can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these bad object internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, they will never comprehend what happened to them, and how it influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                    

Fairbairn noticed that children whom had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" Once again, the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a  loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife..         <blockquote>It become obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that  one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good'. In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so,he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to support the illusion that he/she is living in a loving family.. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being  lazy, disrespectful, or of being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that he parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.          

Then Fairbairn returned to  his earlier discussion that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers of different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic.Here, he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated.        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also,and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents by their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5,6,7,8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                                    

Fairbairn then took up new topics in he same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper which will be described in the next section). The two topics were his theory of treatment and his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the bad object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. Here, he begins to think about the effects of a good object- one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects (which ideally should be present in every child's life)  have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved-albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship  with he analyst as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69) .<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn  identifies one of the key mutaive factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus, a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently, the patient stubbornly clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.

The 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests the Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is  coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. 

Fairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and too the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for, when such bad objects are released the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of he chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe\"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released , however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actual reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through is absolutely correct.Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced  divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" /> 

=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===
{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}
Fairbairn's 1944 article described his structural theory in terms of six structures, including two conscious structures, '''The Central Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''', and two '''pairs''' of unconscious structures. The unconscious structures are: '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Rejecting object''', and:  '''The Libidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Exciting Object'''. The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates. The simple reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community,as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different than the the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships and there are dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized includes the typical dialogues that were originally in the external world, but now continue in the internal world.  

As described in previous sections the neglected child solves the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. Prior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>convinced him that  children separated from their families experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. 

==== Fairbairn's Structural Model and the Splitting of the Ego ====
In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent called the Rejecting Object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions which was called  the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2010)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Within the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego '''relates only to the''' Rejecting Object''',''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent, called the Ideal Object, and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. 

'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  never develops '''\"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no memory of the other ego state which is repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref> 

==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====
The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. 

In less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego. A powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51–71}}</ref> 

'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''

When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />

'''William Ronald Dodds Fairbairn''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛər|b|ɛər|n}}) [[FRSE]] (11 August 1889 – 31 December 1964) was a Scottish psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and a central figure in the development of the [[object relations theory]] of psychoanalysis.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Illusion Of Love: Why The Battered Woman Returns To Her Abuser|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0231100373|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>

==Life==
[[File:The Red House, Cluny Gardens.jpg|thumb|Fairbairn's birthplace - The Red House, Cluny Gardens]]

Ronald Fairbairn was born at the Red House, Cluny Gardens,<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90</ref> in [[Morningside, Edinburgh]] in 1889, the only child of Cecilia Leefe and Thomas Fairbairn, a chartered surveyor, and President of the Edinburgh Architectural Association.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40312|title=Fairbairn, (William) Ronald Dodds (1889–1964), psychiatrist and psychoanalyst|last=|first=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40312}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he studied for three years in [[divinity]] and [[Hellenic Greek]] studies, graduating MA in 1911.

In the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Royal Engineers]] and served under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestinian campaign]], and then the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].

On his return to home he began medical training, probably inspired by his war experience. He received a doctorate in Medicine (MD) on 30 March 1929 from the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"Archive\">Available at the [https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/9999 Edinburgh Research Archive].</ref> From 1927 to 1935 he lectured in psychology at the University and also independently practised analysis. From 1941 until 1954 he was Consultant Psychiatrist to the [[Ministry of Pensions]].<ref name=\":1\" />

In 1931 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[James Drever]], [[Edwin Bramwell]], Sir Godfrey Hilton Thomson and [[Robert Alexander Fleming]].

On the basis of his writings he became an associate member of the British Psychoanalytical Society in 1931, becoming a full member in 1939. Fairbairn, though somewhat isolated in that he spent his entire career in Edinburgh,<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Charles Rycroft|last=Rycroft|first=Charles | title=Psychoanalysis and after | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=132}}</ref> had a profound influence on British Object Relations and the relational schools. Fairbairn was one of the theory-builders for the [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|Middle Group]]<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=21}}</ref> (now called the Independent Group) psychoanalysts. The Independent Group contained analysts who identified with neither the [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]ians nor the [[Anna Freud]]ians. They were more concerned with the relationships between people than with the \"drives\" within them.

He died in Edinburgh at the age of 75. He is buried with his wives in [[Dean Cemetery]] in western [[Edinburgh]]. The grave lies very close to the main east entrance and lodge-house.

In 1926 Fairbairn married Mary Ann More Gordon (1901–1952) the daughter of Harry More Gordon. Their daughter Ellinor was born in 1927, followed by twins in 1928, however they did not survive. Their fourth child was born in 1929, and in 1933 their fifth son [[Nicholas Fairbairn|Nicholas]] was born, who would go on to become a barrister and MP.<ref name=\":0\" />

===''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'' (1952)===

The importance of Fairbain's work lies in its direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. 

Fairbairn's model is  classified as psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models—the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious—as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. 

Greenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn.  
<blockquote>
In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>
The psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id—Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives—is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures—Id, Ego, and Super Ego—mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. 

In contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairburn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>
Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. … At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     
</blockquote>
Over time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.

===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====

In his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics. <blockquote>
… (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.… So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>
The more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:
<blockquote>
Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> 
</blockquote>
Fairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment, and that  that the intolerable-to accept parental failures force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. 

Typically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>
It is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    
</blockquote>
Simply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.

===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====
Fairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of  \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.
Fairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>
Thus, the developmental proceeds, the child gradually realizes that is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>
The greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>
Thus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  

The unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the antilibidinal ego ad he rejecting object in the splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   

Secondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has been validated by the  millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. 

Fairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individual who either live at home with their ageing parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   

===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====
Fairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation which was to search for a good object and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's\"challenge\" of the Freudian model was not a problem for the analytic community despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book in 1983,<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love,help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world  and simultaneously forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individuals life.     

Once these \"bad-object\" memories are dissociated and repressed they become the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second and third points in this quote can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these bad object internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, they will never comprehend what happened to them, and how it influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                        

Fairbairn noticed that children whom had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in 1940's Scotland) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" Once again, the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a  loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife..         <blockquote>It become obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that  one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good'. In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so,he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to support the illusion that he/she is living in a loving family.. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being  lazy, disrespectful, or of being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944). It is a primitive form of splitting in that he parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                     

Then Fairbairn continued his earlier discussion that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers of different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic.Here, he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly they treated him.        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also,and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and at the time it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents by their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5,6,7,8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                                   

Fairbairn then took up new topics in he same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper which will be described in the next section). The two topics were his theory of treatment and his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the bad object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. Here, he begins to think about the effects of a good object- one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive.As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects, which should have been present in every child's life, have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved-albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship  with he analyst as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69) .<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn  identifies one of he mutaive factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient as one that might provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" or more accurately, \"de-repress\" memories of neglect and abuse from his childhood. He also uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus, a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently, the patient clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.

The paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests the Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he did in a very brief comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is  coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. 

Fairbairn's quote is graphic and too the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for, when such bad objects are released the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to fac'''e...at the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of he chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actual reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through is absolutely correct. He was both a philosopher and an advanced  divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" /> 

=== The splitting of the ego ===
{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}
Fairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called '''dissociation''' was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated, for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The '''Rejecting Object''' in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the '''Antilibidinal Ego'''. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: 

\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2018)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131–146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  

Within the child's inner world (his unconscious) '''the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\",''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious '''Central Ego''' that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the '''Ideal Object''') and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the '''Exciting Object''' by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the '''Libidinal Ego''' (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. 

These two unconscious pairs: 
* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' that relates to the '''Rejecting Object''', and 
* the '''Libidinal Ego''' that relates only to the '''Exciting Object''' 
are unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. '''Splitting''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>

'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''

Emotional deprivation, and the resulting fear of abandonment, leads to splitting of the ego, and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects:
* The Central Ego relates to the Ideal Object
* The Antilibidinal Ego relates to the Rejecting Object
* The Libidinal Ego relates to the Exciting Object

The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. 

In less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes  (incorrectly) is stored in their parent (the Exciting Object''')'''. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51–71}}</ref> 

'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''

When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />

===Ban on new temples, toleration of sacrifices===
Constantine, though he made his allegiance clear, did not outlaw paganism; in the words of an early edict, he decreed that polytheists could \"celebrate the rites of an outmoded illusion,\" so long as they did not force Christians to join them.<ref name=\"Peter Brown 2003 p. 74\">Peter Brown, ''Rise of Christendom'' 2nd edition (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003) p. 74.</ref><ref>'' Codex Theodosianius'' 9.16.2.</ref> In a letter to the King of Persia, Constantine wrote how he shunned the \"abominable blood and hateful odors\" of pagan sacrifices, and instead worshiped the High God \"on bended knee\",<ref name=\"Peter Brown 2003 p. 60\"/><ref>Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine'' 4.10.</ref> and in the new capital city he built, Constantine made sure that there were no pagan temples built.<ref name=\"Gerberding2004p28\"/> Constantine would sporadically prohibit public sacrifice and close pagan temples; very little pressure, however, was put on individual pagans, and there were no pagan martyrs.<ref name=\"Peter Brown 2003 p. 74\"/>

When Constantine dedicated [[Constantinople]], two Neoplatonist friends - [[Sopater of Apamea|Sopater]] and [[Praetextus]] - were present. A year and a half later, on Monday 11 May 330, when the festival of Saint Mocius was celebrated, the city was finally dedicated. The goddess [[Tyche]] was invited to come and live in the city, and her statue was placed in the hand of the statue of the emperor that was on top of the [[Column of Constantine]], on the Forum with the same name. Although by now Constantine openly supported Christianity, the city still offered room to pagan religions: there were shrines for the [[Dioscuri]] and [[Tyche]]. The [[Acropolis]], with its ancient pagan temples, was left as it was. As for worshipping the emperor, Constantine's mausoleum gave him a Christ-like status: his tomb was set amid 12 monuments, each containing relics of one of the Apostles. Constantine had continued to engage in pagan rituals. The emperor still claimed to be a supernatural being, although the outward form of this personality cult had become Christian.<ref>[https://www.livius.org/cn-cs/constantinople/constantinople01.html]</ref>

[[File:Follis-Constantine-lyons RIC VI 309.jpg|thumb|300px|Early coin of Constantine commemorating the pagan [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of ''[[Sol Invictus]]'']]
According to some authors,{{Who|date=April 2011}} the issuing of the [[Edict of Milan]],<ref>\"[[Edict of Milan]]\", 313CE.{{cite web |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/UMW/Bible/milan.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717025539/http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/Bible/milan.stm |archivedate=2007-07-17 }}</ref> showed that Constantine continued the policy of toleration which [[Galerius]] had established.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} He \"continued to pay his public honors to the Sun\", until 325, on coins that showed him jointly with ''[[Sol Invictus]]'', whereas his later coins showed the [[labarum|Chi-Rho]] sign.<ref>MacMullan 1984:44.</ref> In that year he had the Christian Bishops convene at the [[First Council of Nicaea]], and from then on continued to take an active interest in the affairs of the Church.

Many historians, including MacMullen, have seen the seeds of future persecution by the state in Constantine's more belligerent utterances regarding the old religion.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> Other historians{{Who|date=April 2011}} emphasize that ''de facto'' [[paganism]] \"was tolerated in the period from Constantine to [[Gratian]]. Emperors were tolerant in deed, if not always in word.\"<ref>Garnsey 1984: 19</ref>

Church restrictions opposing the pillaging of pagan temples by Christians were in place even while the Christians were being persecuted by the pagans. Spanish bishops in AD 305 decreed that anyone who broke idols and was killed while doing so was not formally to be counted as a martyr, as the provocation was too blatant.<ref>[[Ramsay MacMullen]], ''Christianizing the Roman Empire'', 1986, Yale University Press.</ref>

Constantine became the first Emperor in the Christian era to persecute specific groups of Christians, the [[Donatists]], in order to enforce religious unity.<ref>\"There is No Crime for Those who Have Christ: Religious Violence in the Christian Roman Empire\", Michael Gaddis, p55-56, University of California Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-520-24104-5}}</ref>

===Legislation against magic and private divination===
Constantine legislated against magic and private divination, but this may have been motivated by a fear that others could gain power through those means.<ref>Zosimus 2.29.1-2.29.4, [[Theodosian Code]] 16.10.1. Laws against the private practice of divination had been enacted ever since the time of the emperor [[Tiberius]]. The fear of a rival had led many emperors to be severe against those who attempted to divine their successor.</ref> Despite enacting such legislation, he also enacted contradictory legislation that called for the consultation of [[augurs]] after an [[amphitheater]] had been struck by lightning in the year 320.<ref>Theodosian Code 16.10.1</ref> Constantine explicitly allowed public divination as well as public pagan practices to continue.<ref>Theodosian Code 9.16.1-9.16.3.</ref> Constantine also issued laws confirming the rights of [[flamens]], priests and [[duumvirs]].<ref>Theodosian Code 12.1.21, 12.5.2</ref> In 321, he legislated that the \"venerable [[Sunday|day of the sun]]\" should be a day of rest for all citizens. This ambiguous wording is capable of being interpreted as referring to the Christian day of rest or to [[Sol Invictus]].  However, in the year 323, he issued a decree banning Christians from participating in state sacrifices.<ref>''Codex Theodosianus'' 16.2.5</ref>

===Looting and destruction of temples===
He destroyed the Temple of Aphrodite in Lebanon.<ref>J. Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods\", Viking Compass, 2004.</ref> He ordered the execution of eunuch priests in Egypt<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> because they transgressed his moral norms. According to the historian [[Ramsay MacMullen]], Constantine desired to obliterate non-Christians but lacking the means he had to be content with robbing their temples towards the end of his reign.<ref name=MacMullan96>MacMullan 1984:96.</ref> He resorted to derogatory and contemptuous comments relating to the old religion; writing of the \"true obstinacy\" of the pagans, of their \"misguided rites and ceremonial\", and of their \"temples of lying\" contrasted with \"the splendours of the home of truth\".<ref name=\"hughes\">{{citation | title = A History of the Church | first = Philip | last = Hughes | publisher = Sheed & Ward | year = 1949 | volume = I | chapter = 6 | chapter-url = http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/HUGHHIST.TXT}}</ref>

==Anti-paganism policy of Constantius II==
{{main|Anti-paganism policy of Constantius II}}

[[File:Disfigured Augustus Ephesus.jpg|right|thumb|A cult statue of the deified Augustus, disfigured by a Christian cross carved into the emperor's forehead.]]

The anti-paganism policy of Constantius II lasted from 337 till 361. It was marked by laws and edicts that punished pagan practices.<ref name=\"Kirsch04pp200-201\">Kirsch, J. (2004) ''God against the Gods'', pp. 200-1, Viking Compass</ref><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.4\" /> Laws dating from the 350s prescribed the death penalty for those who performed or attended pagan [[sacrifice]]s, and for the worshipping of idols;<ref name=\"Kirsch04pp200-201\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.2\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.6\"/> temples were shut down,<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.4\"/> and the [[Altar of Victory]] was removed from the Senate meeting house.<ref name=\"Sheridan66\"/> There were also frequent episodes of ordinary Christians destroying, pillaging, desecrating, vandalizing many of the ancient pagan temples, tombs and monuments.<ref name=\"Ammianus22.4.3\"/><ref name=\"Sozomen3.18\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.3\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus9.17.2\"/>

Paganism was still popular among the population at the time. The emperor's policies were passively resisted by many governors and magistrates.<ref name=\"hughes\" /><ref name=\"CathEncy1914Constantius\"/><ref name=\"Ammianus9.10and19.12\"/><ref name=\"Bowder1978\"/>

===Initial measures===
Constantius II's legislation began with the banning of the pagan practice of [[sacrifice]].<ref name=\"Kirsch04pp200-201\" /><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.4\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.2\">''The Codex Theodosianus On Religion'', 16.10.2</ref> This was in keeping with his personal maxim was: ''\"Cesset superstitio; sacrificiorum aboleatur insania\"'' (Let superstition cease; let the folly of sacrifices be abolished).<ref name=\"G. Herbermann 1911\">C. G. Herbermann & Georg Grupp, \"Constantine the Great\", Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911, New Advent web site.</ref> According to [[Libanius]], Constantius was effectively under the control of others who inspired him to end pagan sacrifices.<ref name=\"tertullian.net\">
{{Cite web |url=http://www.tertullian.net/fathers/libanius_pro_templis_02_trans.htm |title=\"Libanius Oration\" 30.7, For the Temples |access-date=2015-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719024530/http://www.tertullian.net/fathers/libanius_pro_templis_02_trans.htm |archive-date=2011-07-19 |url-status=dead }} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719024530/http://www.tertullian.net/fathers/libanius_pro_templis_02_trans.htm |date=2011-07-19 }}
</ref>

In the year 353 Constantius prohibited pagan sacrifice under the penalty of death. He also shut down some temples, forbade access to them, and ended their subsidies of public taxes.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.4\"/>

Consistent with Christian theology, Constantius carried out  an active campaign against magicians, [[astrologers]] and other diviners. This may also be due to his becoming fearful that others might use these means to make someone else emperor.<ref>Theodosian Code 9.16.4, 9.16.5, 9.16.6</ref>

Herbermann contends that the anti-paganism legislation had an unfavourable influence on the [[Middle Ages]] and become the basis of the [[Inquisition]].<ref name=\"G. Herbermann 1911\"/><ref name=\"CathEncy1914Constantius\">Catholic Encyclopedia (1914) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16027c.htm ''Flavius Julius Constantius'']</ref><ref name=\"Ammianus9.10and19.12\">[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ''Res Gestae'' 9.10, 19.12. quote summary: Ammianus describes pagan sacrifices and worship taking place openly in [[Alexandria]] and [[Rome]]. The [[Roman Calendar]] of 354 cites many pagan festivals as though they were still being openly observed. See also the descriptions of pagan worship in the following works: Firmicius Maternus De Errore Profanorum Religionum; Vetus Orbis Descriptio Graeci Scriptoris sub Constantio.</ref><ref name=\"Bowder1978\">Bowder, D. (1978) ''The Age of Constantine and Julian''</ref>

===Relative moderation===
The relative moderation of Constantius' actions toward paganism is reflected by the fact that it was not until over 20 years after Constantius' death, during the reign of [[Gratian]], that any pagan senators protested their religion's treatment.<ref>Salzman, M.R., ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'' (2002), p. 182</ref> The emperor never attempted to disband the various Roman priestly colleges or the [[Vestal Virgin]]s<ref name=\"Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68\">Vasiliev, A.A, ''History of the Byzantine Empire 324–1453'' (1958), p. 68</ref> and never acted against the various pagan schools. He ordered the election of a priest for Africa.<ref name=\"Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68\"/> He remained [[pontifex maximus]] until his death, and was deified by the Roman Senate after his death.

===Pagan resistance===
The government's policies could not be rigidly executed due the strength of paganism among the population.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"CathEncy1914Constantius\"/><ref name=\"Ammianus9.10and19.12\" /> No matter what the imperial edicts declared in their fearful threats, the vast numbers of pagans, and the passive resistance of pagan governors and magistrates rendered them largely impotent in their application.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"Bowder1978\"/>

===Anti-pagan actions by ordinary Christians===
Some Christians encouraged the emperor to take even more extreme measures in their zeal to stamp out paganism, e.g. in the aftermath of the abolition of sacrifices.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> [[Firmicus Maternus]], a convert to Christianity, urged: \"Paganism, most holy emperors, must be utterly destroyed and blotted out, and disciplined by the severest enactments of your edicts, lest the deadly delusion of the presumption continue to stain the Roman world\" and \"How fortunate you are that God, whose agents you are, has reserved for you the destruction of idolatry and the ruin of profane temples.\"<ref name=\"Kirsch04pp200-201\"/>

Sozomen contends that Constantius did not, apparently, attempt to stop the Christians from destroying and pillaging many of the ancient temples.<ref name=\"Ammianus22.4.3\">[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ''Res Gestae'' 22.4.3</ref><ref name=\"Sozomen3.18\">[[Sozomen]] ''Ecclesiastical History'' 3.18.</ref> However, in the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] there is a law for the preservation of the temples that were situated outside of city walls.<ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.3\">Theodosian Code 16.10.3</ref>

Constantius enacted another law that exacted a fine from those who were guilty of vandalizing sites holy to pagans and placed the care of these monuments and tombs under the pagan priests.<ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus9.17.2\">Theodosian Code 9.17.2</ref>

===Magnentius rebellion===
{{original research|date=June 2019}}
[[Magnentius]] rebelled against and killed Constans. Although he used Christian symbols on his coins, he revoked the anti-paganism legislation of Constans and even permitted the celebration of [[nocturnal sacrifices]]. Three years later, in the year 353, Constantius defeated Magnentius and once again forbade the performance of the rituals.<ref>Theodosian Code 16.10.5</ref> This law seems to have had little effect as we find Constantius once again legislating against paganism in 356. Constantius now declared that anyone found guilty of attending sacrifices or of worshipping idols would be executed.<ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.6\">Theodosian Code 16.10.6</ref>
<!-- In the year 357, Constantius celebrated his [[Vicennalia]] by visiting the city of Rome. Acting as the [[Pontifex Maximus]], Constantius apparently conferred priesthoods on worthy individuals and confirmed privileges to the [[Vestal Virgins]] as well as subsidies to the pagan cults. (Symmachus Epistle 10) Constantius also enacted a law confirming the prerogatives of the pagan priests.(Theodosian Code 12.1.46) In spite of Pagan protests, however,--> 
It appears the magistrates were uncomfortable with carrying out this law; it was largely ignored.

===Removal of the Altar of Victory===
In 357 Constantius removed the [[Altar of Victory]] in the Senate house because of the complaints of some Christian Senators. This altar had been installed by Augustus in 29 BCE; each Senator had traditionally made a sacrifice upon the altar before entering the Senate house. This altar was later restored, either silently, soon after Constantius' departure, or by the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]].<ref name=\"Sheridan66\">{{cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=J.J.|year=1966|title=The Altar of Victory – Paganism's Last Battle|journal=L'Antiquite Classique|volume=35|issue=1|pages=186–187|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/antiq_0770-2817_1966_num_35_1_1466|doi=10.3406/antiq.1966.1466}}</ref>

==Restoration and tolerance from Julian until Valentinian I/Valens (361–378)==
[[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (361-363) attempted to revive paganism during his brief period of rule. Under the equally brief reigns of his successors - [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]], [[Valens]] and [[Valentinian I]] (363-378) - persecution of pagans was minimal.

===Under the sole rule of Julian (361–363)===
Julian, who had been a co-emperor since 355, ruled solely for 18 months from 361 to 363. He was a nephew of Constantine and received a Christian training. After childhood, Julian was educated by [[:wikt:Hellenist|Hellenists]] and became attracted to the teachings of [[neoplatonists]] and the old religions. However, he witnessed the assassination of his father, brother and other family members by the guards of the imperial palace; rightly or wrongly, he blamed this brutal act on the Christian Emperor Constantius. His antipathy to Christianity was deepened when Constantius executed Julian's only remaining brother in 354.<ref>\"FLAVIUS CLAUDIUS JULIANUS\", Karl Hoeber, Catholic Encyclopedia 1910, retrieved 1 May 2007.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08558b.htm]</ref> Julian's religious beliefs were [[syncretic]] and he was initiated into at least three [[mystery religions]]. But his religious open-mindedness did not extend to Christianity since it was fundamentally incompatible with syncretic paganism.<ref name=\"hughes\" /><ref name=\"Jeffrey Brodd 1995\">\"Julian the Apostate and His Plan to Rebuild the Jerusalem Temple\", Jeffrey Brodd, Biblical Archaeology Society, Bible Review, October 1995.</ref>
Upon becoming emperor, Julian attempted to restore the old Roman religion. He also introduced some reforms to that religion in the hope of making it the driving force behind the empire.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"PopeBenXVI2006Ency\">[[Pope Benedict XVI]] (2006) [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html ''Deus Caritas Est''] (Encyclical)</ref><ref>Julian's training in Christianity influenced his ideas concerning the revival and organisation of the old religion, shaping it into a more coherent body of doctrine, ritual and liturgy with a hierarchy under the supervision of the emperor.: \"FLAVIUS CLAUDIUS JULIANUS\", Karl Hoeber, Catholic Encyclopedia 1910, retrieved 13 May 2007.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08558b.htm]  Julian organised elaborate rituals and attempted to set forth a clarified philosophy of [[Neo-Platonism]] that might unite all pagans.(Ammianus Res Gestae 22.12)</ref> Julian allowed religious freedom and avoided any form of actual compulsion. The Christian [[Sozomen]] acknowledges that Julian did not compel Christians to offer sacrifice nor did he allow the people to commit any act of injustice towards the Christians or insult them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/26025.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Ecclesiastical History, Book V (Sozomen)|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> However, no Christian was allowed to teach or to study the ancient classical authors; \"Let them keep to Matthew and Luke\".

Those who had demolished temples during the reign of Constantine and Constantius, were ordered to rebuild them, or to defray the expenses of their re-erection.<ref>Sozomen Ecclesiastical History 5.5[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/26025.htm]</ref> Julian required those who had abandoned the deities to purify themselves before they were allowed the privilege of taking part in their worship once again. He was devoted to divination and allowed his subjects to freely practice this art.<ref>Ammianus Res Gestae 25.4</ref>-->
The Jewish historian and theologian Jacob Neusner writes: \"It was only after the near catastrophe of Julian's reversion to paganism that the Christian emperors systematically legislated against paganism so as to destroy it.\"<ref>R. Kirsch, \"God against the Gods\", Viking Compass, 2004.</ref>\\

<blockquote>In the eighteen brief months that he ruled between 361 and 363, Julian did not persecute [Christians], as a hostile tradition contends. But he did make clear that the partnership between Rome and Christian bishops forged by Constantine and maintained, despite conflicts over goals, by his son Constantius II, was now at an end, replaced by a government that defined its interests and those of Christianity as antithetical.<ref>H.A.Drake, \"Lambs into Lions: Explaining early Christian intolerance,\" ''Past & Present'' 153 (1996): 3-36 at p.33.</ref></blockquote>

===Religious toleration under Jovian, Valentinian and Valens===
After the death of Julian, Jovian seems to have instituted a policy of religious toleration which avoided the extremes{{Request quotation|date=April 2011}} of Constantius and Julian.<ref>Themistius Oration 5; Photius Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius 8.5</ref> Under Valentinian and Valens, religious toleration continued. Pagan writers praise both of these emperors for their liberal religious policies.<ref>Ammianus Res Gestae 20.9; Themistius Oration 12.</ref>  Valentinian, who ruled in the west, seems to have only been a half-hearted Christian as he avoided attending his inaugural ceremony by twenty-four hours in order to avoid an inauspicious day (the inter-calary day of the bi-sextile year).<ref>Grindle, Gilbert. The Destruction of Paganism in the Roman Empire. (1892): 17–18.</ref>  Valentinian and Valens granted complete toleration for all cults at the beginning of their reign in 364.<ref name=\"Theodosian Code 9.16.9\">Theodosian Code 9.16.9</ref> Valentinian even allowed the performance of nocturnal sacrifices, which had been previously prohibited due to the attempt of some people to practice unlawful divination under the cover of the night, after the proconsul of Greece appealed to him.<ref>Zosimus 4.3</ref>  Valentinian also confirmed the rights and privileges of the pagan priests and confirmed the right of pagans to be the exclusive caretakers of their temples.<ref>Theodosian Code 17.1.60, 17.1.75, 16.1.1</ref>  Valens, who ruled the east, was an Arian and was too engaged with fighting against the Orthodox Christians to bother much with pagans. In both west and east, severe laws were once again passed prohibiting private divination,<ref>Theodosian Code 9.16.7, 9.16.8, 9.16.10, 9.38.3, 9.38.4</ref> and haruspices and augurs began to be afraid to show themselves in public. This led the emperors to formally authorise the practice of official and lawful divination by law in 371.<ref name=\"Theodosian Code 9.16.9\"/>

{{main|Anti-paganism influenced by Saint Ambrose}}
[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|right|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'', [[Anthony van Dyck]].]]

The anti-paganism policies pursued by the emperors [[Gratian]], [[Valentinian II]] and [[Theodosius I]] may have been influenced by Saint [[Ambrose]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Bishop of Milan]].<ref name=\"Byfield2003\">Byfield (2003) pp. 92-4 quote: {{quote|In the west, such [anti-pagan] tendencies were less pronounced, although the enemies of paganism had an especially influential advocate.

{{main|Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I}}

The anti-paganism policies of [[Theodosius I]] began in 381, following the first few years of his reign over the Eastern Empire. Theodosius reiterated Constantine's ban on pagan sacrifice and [[haruspicy]] [[death penalty|on pain of death]]. He pioneered the criminalisation of Magistrates who did not enforce the anti-pagan laws. He broke up some pagan associations and destroyed pagan temples.

Between 389-391 he issued the \"Theodosian decrees\" which established a practical ban on paganism;<ref name=\"TheodosianCode16.10.11\">Theodosian Code 16.10.11</ref> visits to the temples were forbidden,<ref name=\"TheodosianCode16.10.10\">Theodosian Code 16.10.10</ref><ref name=\"Routery1997ch4\">Routery, Michael (1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/19980111141747/http://vinland.org/scamp/grove/kreich/chapter4.html ''The First Missionary War.

==Anti-paganism policies from Theodosius I until the collapse of the western empire==
{{original research|only primary sources|date=June 2019}}

Anti-paganism policies continued from Theodosius I until the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] in the west. Anti-paganism laws were instated throughout this period, by emperors including [[Arcadius]],

==After the fall of the Western Empire==
In 476, the last western emperor, [[Romulus Augustulus]], was deposed by [[Odoacer]], who became the first \"[[barbarian]]\" king of Italy. Pagans used the occasion to attempt to revive the old rites. In 484, the [[Magister militum per Orientem]], [[Illus]], revolted against Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and raised his own candidate, [[Leontius (usurper)|Leontius]], to the throne. Leontius hoped to reopen the temples and restore the ancient ceremonies; as such, many Pagans joined in his revolt against Zeno.<ref name=\"PhotiusBibliotheca242\"/> Illus and Leontius were compelled, however, to flee to a remote [[Isauria]]n fortress, where Zeno besieged them for four years. Zeno finally captured them in 488 and promptly had them executed.<ref>Theophanes Chronographia s.a. A.M. 5976-5980; John Malalas Chronicle 15.12-15.14.</ref> Following the revolt, Zeno instituted harsh anti-paganism policies. With the failure of the revolt of Leontios, some pagans became disillusioned and became Christian, or pretended to do so, in order to avoid persecution.<ref>Pagans were still sufficiently numerous during the reign of Justinian for a law to be published, in 527 (Justinian Code 1.5.12), which barred pagans from office and confiscated their property.</ref> The subjugation of the Roman Empire to Christianity became complete when the emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], who came to the throne in 491, was required to sign a written declaration of orthodoxy before his coronation.

Under [[Pope Gregory I]], the caverns, grottoes, crags and glens that had once been used for the worship of the pagan gods were now [[Cultural appropriation|appropriated]] by Christianity: \"Let altars be built and relics be placed there\" wrote [[Pope Gregory I]], \"so that [the pagans] have to change from the worship of the daemones to that of the true God.\"<ref name=\"church\">The modern Church takes a much less antagonistic stance to non-Abrahamic religions.

Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods,\" p. 278, Viking Compass, 1997.</ref></blockquote>

==Evaluation and legacy==
Except for the most recent literature, for at least the last 200 years historical scholarship has followed a conceptual scheme in which the persecution of those Mediterranean religions that we now label \"paganism\" was seen as the result of the [[religious intolerance]] inherent in the monotheistic Christian faith. The classic expression of this view occurs in the work of [[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]].'' As historian [[Harold A. Drake]] puts it, \"It is difficult to overestimate the influence of Gibbon's interpretation on subsequent scholarship.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions'', p. 8</ref>

Harold Drake takes issue with the historiography of Gibbon, arguing that while persecution certainly occurred for religious reasons, that the underlying motivation was consolidation of power in the Constantinian dynasty, which was offered in the form of promoting the cult of Christianity to the exclusion of others. He writes that \"while there is obviously some truth in the proposition that intolerance follows from the rejection of other gods that lies at the core of monotheistic belief,\" this alone could neither explain why pagans had previously persecuted Christians, nor why there were \"important voices for moderation in the early Christian community.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 5</ref> H.A. Drake writes: \"Gibbon skirts a serious problem: for three centuries prior to Constantine, the tolerant pagans who people the Decline and Fall were the authors of several major persecutions, in which Christians were the victims.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 7</ref> Gibbon, however, implies that such an argument is in itself flawed, in that Christians later exaggerated the depth and magnitude of the persecutions against them. He argues that a diligent review of the earliest Christian source, Eusebius, reveals by his own accounting that less than one hundred Christians were executed in Palestine under [[Diocletian]] for refusing civic sacrifices as a test of their loyalty.<ref>Gibbon, Edward The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XVI, Part 8; [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/732/732-h/732-h.htm#link2HCH0008 online text] from [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>

It should be remembered, however, that early persecution of Christians did not follow the same prerogatives commonly ascribed to religious persecution in the modern sense, but rather arose from a feeling of \"otherness\" that Christians aroused in the society of the time, being adverse as they were to participating in the religious life of the Roman empire at large. Private religion, or the sacra privita, was not regulated by the state until the [[Christianization]] of the Empire, when paganism was proscribed even within the home. Private religion was the purview of the family and the individual, and varied between various ethnic groups. As such, many pagans were not opposed to Christian theology per se, but rather to the motivations of early Christians, who seemed rather \"unpatriotic\" in their isolation and aggressiveness towards other faiths. Christians were also seen as being a public embodiment of [[superstitio]]; what might be described today as [[religious zeal]], but which also had connotations of [[magical thinking]]. While this was usually regarded as a private vice, one which was commonly thought to cause mental instability, it could also been seen as dangerous to the order of society. Romans had previously ascribed superstitio to excessive practice of magic, as well as other religious groups, among them [[Judaism]], which was seen as opposed to the [[interpretatio romana]], under which their public observances would be syncretised and brought into line with Roman practices. Unlike Christianity, however, these groups were not generally seen as threats to traditional Roman religious observance itself, but as obstacles to civic order and [[Romanization]].

Peter Garnsey strongly disagrees with those who describe the attitude of the \"plethora of cults\" that are labelled 'Paganism' as \"tolerant\" or \"inclusive.\"<ref>Garnsey 1984: 24</ref> What [[Ramsay MacMullen]] wrote, that in its process of expansion, the Roman Empire was \"completely tolerant, in heaven as on earth\"<ref>quoted after Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> (with the notable exceptions of the Jews and Christians), is for Garnsey a simple \"misuse of terminology.\"<ref name=\"Garnsey -25\">Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> The foreign gods were not tolerated, but made subject together with their communities when they were conquered. The Romans \"cannot be said to have extended to them the same combination of disapproval and acceptance which is [[religious toleration|toleration]].\"<ref name=\"Garnsey -25\"/>

The example of Constantine, Theodosius and Justinian, who were seen as \"godly emperors (...) serving the church and crushing its enemies,\" has been cited repeatedly by Christian authors who endorsed an idea of [[religious persecution]].<ref>John Coffey (2000), ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558-1689'', Studies in Modern History, Pearson Education, p. 31; O. O'Donovan (1996), ''The Desire of the Nations: Rediscovering the Roots of Political Theology'', esp. ch. 6.</ref> According to the historian [[Ramsay MacMullen]], a council of bishops at Toledo in 681 called on civil authorities to seize and [[behead]] all those guilty of non-Christian practices of any sort.<ref>Ramsay MacMullen, \"Christianity & Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries,\" Chap 1:16, \"Persecution,\" {{ISBN|0-300-07148-5}}</ref> Medieval Emperor [[Charlemagne]] ruled in September 774 that the Saxons (Westfali, Ostfali, and Angrarii) must be presented with the alternative of baptism or death<ref>Thomas J. Shahan & E. Macpherson, \"Charlemagne,\" The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume III. Published 1908 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03610c.htm]</ref> and had 4,500 pagan Saxons beheaded in the [[Massacre of Verden]].
 		 	
In the 20th century, the Roman Catholic Church issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis Humanae]]\" that fully embraced the right of every human person to [[religious freedom]], as part of the [[Vatican II]] council, on 7 December 1965. On 12 March 2000, [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed publicly for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\".<ref>{{cite web |title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS |date=March 12, 2000 |accessdate=16 April 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/pages/12654_pope_john_paul_ii_asks_for_forgiveness_march_12_2000_.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023162418/http://www.sacredheart.edu/pages/12654_pope_john_paul_ii_asks_for_forgiveness_march_12_2000_.cfm |archivedate=2008-10-23}}</ref>

===Ban on new temples, toleration of sacrifices===
Constantine, though he made his allegiance clear, did not outlaw paganism; in the words of an early edict, he decreed that polytheists could \"celebrate the rites of an outmoded illusion,\" so long as they did not force Christians to join them.<ref name=\"Peter Brown 2003 p. 74\">Peter Brown, ''Rise of Christendom'' 2nd edition (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003) p. 74.</ref><ref>'' Codex Theodosianius'' 9.16.2.</ref> In a letter to the King of Persia, Constantine wrote how he shunned the \"abominable blood and hateful odors\" of pagan sacrifices, and instead worshiped the High God \"on bended knee\",<ref name=\"Peter Brown 2003 p. 60\"/><ref>Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine'' 4.10.</ref> and in the new capital city he built, Constantine made sure that there were no pagan temples built.<ref name=\"Gerberding2004p28\"/> Constantine would sporadically prohibit public sacrifice and close pagan temples; very little pressure, however, was put on individual pagans, and there were no pagan martyrs.<ref name=\"Peter Brown 2003 p. 74\"/>

When Constantine dedicated [[Constantinople]], two Neoplatonist friends - [[Sopater of Apamea|Sopater]] and [[Praetextus]] - were present. A year and a half later, on Monday 11 May 330, when the festival of Saint Mocius was celebrated, the city was finally dedicated. The goddess [[Tyche]] was invited to come and live in the city, and her statue was placed in the hand of the statue of the emperor that was on top of the [[Column of Constantine]], on the Forum with the same name. Although by now Constantine openly supported Christianity, the city still offered room to pagan religions: there were shrines for the [[Dioscuri]] and [[Tyche]]. The [[Acropolis]], with its ancient pagan temples, was left as it was. As for worshipping the emperor, Constantine's mausoleum gave him a Christ-like status: his tomb was set amid 12 monuments, each containing relics of one of the Apostles. Constantine had continued to engage in pagan rituals. The emperor still claimed to be a supernatural being, although the outward form of this personality cult had become Christian.<ref>[https://www.livius.org/cn-cs/constantinople/constantinople01.html]</ref>

Many historians, including MacMullen, have seen the seeds of future persecution by the state in Constantine's more belligerent utterances regarding the old religion.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> Other historians{{Who|date=April 2011}} emphasize that ''de facto'' [[paganism]] \"was tolerated in the period from Constantine to [[Gratian]]. Emperors were tolerant in deed, if not always in word.\"<ref>Garnsey 1984: 19</ref>

Church restrictions opposing the pillaging of pagan temples by Christians were in place even while the Christians were being persecuted by the pagans. Spanish bishops in AD 305 decreed that anyone who broke idols and was killed while doing so was not formally to be counted as a martyr, as the provocation was too blatant.<ref>[[Ramsay MacMullen]], ''Christianizing the Roman Empire'', 1986, Yale University Press.</ref>

Constantine became the first Emperor in the Christian era to persecute specific groups of Christians, the [[Donatists]], in order to enforce religious unity.<ref>\"There is No Crime for Those who Have Christ: Religious Violence in the Christian Roman Empire\", Michael Gaddis, p55-56, University of California Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-520-24104-5}}</ref>

===Legislation against magic and private divination===
Constantine legislated against magic and private divination, but this may have been motivated by a fear that others could gain power through those means.<ref>Zosimus 2.29.1-2.29.4, [[Theodosian Code]] 16.10.1. Laws against the private practice of divination had been enacted ever since the time of the emperor [[Tiberius]].

This ambiguous wording is capable of being interpreted as referring to the Christian day of rest or to [[Sol Invictus]].  However, in the year 323, he issued a decree banning Christians from participating in state sacrifices.<ref>''Codex Theodosianus'' 16.2.5</ref>

==Anti-paganism policy of Constantius II==
{{main|Anti-paganism policy of Constantius II}}

[[File:Disfigured Augustus Ephesus.jpg|right|thumb|A cult statue of the deified Augustus, disfigured by a Christian cross carved into the emperor's forehead.]]

The anti-paganism policy of Constantius II lasted from 337 till 361. It was marked by laws and edicts that punished pagan practices.<ref name=\"Kirsch04pp200-201\">Kirsch, J. (2004) ''God against the Gods'', pp. 200-1, Viking Compass</ref><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.4\" /> Laws dating from the 350s prescribed the death penalty for those who performed or attended pagan [[sacrifice]]s, and for the worshipping of idols;<ref name=\"Kirsch04pp200-201\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.2\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.6\"/> temples were shut down,<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.4\"/> and the [[Altar of Victory]] was removed from the Senate meeting house.<ref name=\"Sheridan66\"/> There were also frequent episodes of ordinary Christians destroying, pillaging, desecrating, vandalizing many of the ancient pagan temples, tombs and monuments.<ref name=\"Ammianus22.4.3\"/><ref name=\"Sozomen3.18\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.3\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus9.17.2\"/>

Paganism was still popular among the population at the time. The emperor's policies were passively resisted by many governors and magistrates.<ref name=\"hughes\" /><ref name=\"CathEncy1914Constantius\"/><ref name=\"Ammianus9.10and19.12\"/><ref name=\"Bowder1978\"/>

===Initial measures===
Constantius II's legislation began with the banning of the pagan practice of [[sacrifice]].<ref name=\"Kirsch04pp200-201\" /><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.4\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.2\">''The Codex Theodosianus On Religion'', 16.10.2</ref> This was in keeping with his personal maxim was: ''\"Cesset superstitio; sacrificiorum aboleatur insania\"'' (Let superstition cease; let the folly of sacrifices be abolished).<ref name=\"G. Herbermann 1911\">C. G. Herbermann & Georg Grupp, \"Constantine the Great\", Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911, New Advent web site.</ref> According to [[Libanius]], Constantius was effectively under the control of others who inspired him to end pagan sacrifices.<ref name=\"tertullian.net\">
{{Cite web |url=http://www.tertullian.net/fathers/libanius_pro_templis_02_trans.htm |title=\"Libanius Oration\" 30.7, For the Temples |access-date=2015-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719024530/http://www.tertullian.net/fathers/libanius_pro_templis_02_trans.htm |archive-date=2011-07-19 |url-status=dead }} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719024530/http://www.tertullian.net/fathers/libanius_pro_templis_02_trans.htm |date=2011-07-19 }}
</ref>

In the year 353 Constantius prohibited pagan sacrifice under the penalty of death. He also shut down some temples, forbade access to them, and ended their subsidies of public taxes.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.4\"/>

Consistent with Christian theology, Constantius carried out  an active campaign against magicians, [[astrologers]] and other diviners. This may also be due to his becoming fearful that others might use these means to make someone else emperor.<ref>Theodosian Code 9.16.4, 9.16.5, 9.16.6</ref>

Herbermann contends that the anti-paganism legislation had an unfavourable influence on the [[Middle Ages]] and become the basis of the [[Inquisition]].<ref name=\"G. Herbermann 1911\"/><ref name=\"CathEncy1914Constantius\">Catholic Encyclopedia (1914) [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16027c.htm ''Flavius Julius Constantius'']</ref><ref name=\"Ammianus9.10and19.12\">[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ''Res Gestae'' 9.10, 19.12. quote summary: Ammianus describes pagan sacrifices and worship taking place openly in [[Alexandria]] and [[Rome]]. The [[Roman Calendar]] of 354 cites many pagan festivals as though they were still being openly observed. See also the descriptions of pagan worship in the following works: Firmicius Maternus De Errore Profanorum Religionum; Vetus Orbis Descriptio Graeci Scriptoris sub Constantio.</ref><ref name=\"Bowder1978\">Bowder, D. (1978) ''The Age of Constantine and Julian''</ref>

===Relative moderation===
The relative moderation of Constantius' actions toward paganism is reflected by the fact that it was not until over 20 years after Constantius' death, during the reign of [[Gratian]], that any pagan senators protested their religion's treatment.<ref>Salzman, M.R., ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'' (2002), p. 182</ref> The emperor never attempted to disband the various Roman priestly colleges or the [[Vestal Virgin]]s<ref name=\"Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68\">Vasiliev, A.A, ''History of the Byzantine Empire 324–1453'' (1958), p. 68</ref> and never acted against the various pagan schools. He ordered the election of a priest for Africa.<ref name=\"Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68\"/> He remained [[pontifex maximus]] until his death, and was deified by the Roman Senate after his death.

===Pagan resistance===
The government's policies could not be rigidly executed due the strength of paganism among the population.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"CathEncy1914Constantius\"/><ref name=\"Ammianus9.10and19.12\" /> No matter what the imperial edicts declared in their fearful threats, the vast numbers of pagans, and the passive resistance of pagan governors and magistrates rendered them largely impotent in their application.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"Bowder1978\"/>

===Anti-pagan actions by ordinary Christians===
Some Christians encouraged the emperor to take even more extreme measures in their zeal to stamp out paganism, e.g. in the aftermath of the abolition of sacrifices.<ref name=\"hughes\"/> [[Firmicus Maternus]], a convert to Christianity, urged: \"Paganism, most holy emperors, must be utterly destroyed and blotted out, and disciplined by the severest enactments of your edicts, lest the deadly delusion of the presumption continue to stain the Roman world\" and \"How fortunate you are that God, whose agents you are, has reserved for you the destruction of idolatry and the ruin of profane temples.\"<ref name=\"Kirsch04pp200-201\"/>

Sozomen contends that Constantius did not, apparently, attempt to stop the Christians from destroying and pillaging many of the ancient temples.<ref name=\"Ammianus22.4.3\">[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ''Res Gestae'' 22.4.3</ref><ref name=\"Sozomen3.18\">[[Sozomen]] ''Ecclesiastical History'' 3.18.</ref> However, in the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] there is a law for the preservation of the temples that were situated outside of city walls.<ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.3\">Theodosian Code 16.10.3</ref>

Constantius enacted another law that exacted a fine from those who were guilty of vandalizing sites holy to pagans and placed the care of these monuments and tombs under the pagan priests.<ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus9.17.2\">Theodosian Code 9.17.2</ref>

===Magnentius rebellion===
{{original research|date=June 2019}}
[[Magnentius]] rebelled against and killed Constans. Although he used Christian symbols on his coins, he revoked the anti-paganism legislation of Constans and even permitted the celebration of [[nocturnal sacrifices]]. Three years later, in the year 353, Constantius defeated Magnentius and once again forbade the performance of the rituals.<ref>Theodosian Code 16.10.5</ref> This law seems to have had little effect as we find Constantius once again legislating against paganism in 356. Constantius now declared that anyone found guilty of attending sacrifices or of worshipping idols would be executed.<ref name=\"CodexTheodosianus16.10.6\">Theodosian Code 16.10.6</ref>
<!-- In the year 357, Constantius celebrated his [[Vicennalia]] by visiting the city of Rome. Acting as the [[Pontifex Maximus]], Constantius apparently conferred priesthoods on worthy individuals and confirmed privileges to the [[Vestal Virgins]] as well as subsidies to the pagan cults. (Symmachus Epistle 10) Constantius also enacted a law confirming the prerogatives of the pagan priests.(Theodosian Code 12.1.46) In spite of Pagan protests, however,--> 
It appears the magistrates were uncomfortable with carrying out this law; it was largely ignored.

===Removal of the Altar of Victory===
In 357 Constantius removed the [[Altar of Victory]] in the Senate house because of the complaints of some Christian Senators. This altar had been installed by Augustus in 29 BCE; each Senator had traditionally made a sacrifice upon the altar before entering the Senate house. This altar was later restored, either silently, soon after Constantius' departure, or by the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]].<ref name=\"Sheridan66\">{{cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=J.J.|year=1966|title=The Altar of Victory – Paganism's Last Battle|journal=L'Antiquite Classique|volume=35|issue=1|pages=186–187|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/antiq_0770-2817_1966_num_35_1_1466|doi=10.3406/antiq.1966.1466}}</ref>

==Restoration and tolerance from Julian until Valentinian I/Valens (361–378)==
[[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (361-363) attempted to revive paganism during his brief period of rule. Under the equally brief reigns of his successors - [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]], [[Valens]] and [[Valentinian I]] (363-378) - persecution of pagans was minimal.

===Under the sole rule of Julian (361–363)===
Julian, who had been a co-emperor since 355, ruled solely for 18 months from 361 to 363. He was a nephew of Constantine and received a Christian training. After childhood, Julian was educated by [[:wikt:Hellenist|Hellenists]] and became attracted to the teachings of [[neoplatonists]] and the old religions. However, he witnessed the assassination of his father, brother and other family members by the guards of the imperial palace; rightly or wrongly, he blamed this brutal act on the Christian Emperor Constantius. His antipathy to Christianity was deepened when Constantius executed Julian's only remaining brother in 354.<ref>\"FLAVIUS CLAUDIUS JULIANUS\", Karl Hoeber, Catholic Encyclopedia 1910, retrieved 1 May 2007.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08558b.htm]</ref> Julian's religious beliefs were [[syncretic]] and he was initiated into at least three [[mystery religions]]. But his religious open-mindedness did not extend to Christianity since it was fundamentally incompatible with syncretic paganism.<ref name=\"hughes\" /><ref name=\"Jeffrey Brodd 1995\">\"Julian the Apostate and His Plan to Rebuild the Jerusalem Temple\", Jeffrey Brodd, Biblical Archaeology Society, Bible Review, October 1995.</ref>
Upon becoming emperor, Julian attempted to restore the old Roman religion. He also introduced some reforms to that religion in the hope of making it the driving force behind the empire.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"PopeBenXVI2006Ency\">[[Pope Benedict XVI]] (2006) [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html ''Deus Caritas Est''] (Encyclical)</ref><ref>Julian's training in Christianity influenced his ideas concerning the revival and organisation of the old religion, shaping it into a more coherent body of doctrine, ritual and liturgy with a hierarchy under the supervision of the emperor.: \"FLAVIUS CLAUDIUS JULIANUS\", Karl Hoeber, Catholic Encyclopedia 1910, retrieved 13 May 2007.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08558b.htm]  Julian organised elaborate rituals and attempted to set forth a clarified philosophy of [[Neo-Platonism]] that might unite all pagans.(Ammianus Res Gestae 22.12)</ref> Julian allowed religious freedom and avoided any form of actual compulsion. The Christian [[Sozomen]] acknowledges that Julian did not compel Christians to offer sacrifice nor did he allow the people to commit any act of injustice towards the Christians or insult them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/26025.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Ecclesiastical History, Book V (Sozomen)|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> However, no Christian was allowed to teach or to study the ancient classical authors; \"Let them keep to Matthew and Luke\".

Those who had demolished temples during the reign of Constantine and Constantius, were ordered to rebuild them, or to defray the expenses of their re-erection.<ref>Sozomen Ecclesiastical History 5.5[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/26025.htm]</ref> Julian required those who had abandoned the deities to purify themselves before they were allowed the privilege of taking part in their worship once again. He was devoted to divination and allowed his subjects to freely practice this art.<ref>Ammianus Res Gestae 25.4</ref>-->
The Jewish historian and theologian Jacob Neusner writes: \"It was only after the near catastrophe of Julian's reversion to paganism that the Christian emperors systematically legislated against paganism so as to destroy it.\"<ref>R. Kirsch, \"God against the Gods\", Viking Compass, 2004.</ref>\\

<blockquote>In the eighteen brief months that he ruled between 361 and 363, Julian did not persecute [Christians], as a hostile tradition contends. But he did make clear that the partnership between Rome and Christian bishops forged by Constantine and maintained, despite conflicts over goals, by his son Constantius II, was now at an end, replaced by a government that defined its interests and those of Christianity as antithetical.<ref>H.A.Drake, \"Lambs into Lions: Explaining early Christian intolerance,\" ''Past & Present'' 153 (1996): 3-36 at p.33.</ref></blockquote>

===Religious toleration under Jovian, Valentinian and Valens===
After the death of Julian, Jovian seems to have instituted a policy of religious toleration which avoided the extremes{{Request quotation|date=April 2011}} of Constantius and Julian.<ref>Themistius Oration 5; Photius Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius 8.5</ref> Under Valentinian and Valens, religious toleration continued. Pagan writers praise both of these emperors for their liberal religious policies.<ref>Ammianus Res Gestae 20.9; Themistius Oration 12.</ref>  Valentinian, who ruled in the west, seems to have only been a half-hearted Christian as he avoided attending his inaugural ceremony by twenty-four hours in order to avoid an inauspicious day (the inter-calary day of the bi-sextile year).<ref>Grindle, Gilbert. The Destruction of Paganism in the Roman Empire. (1892): 17–18.</ref>  Valentinian and Valens granted complete toleration for all cults at the beginning of their reign in 364.<ref name=\"Theodosian Code 9.16.9\">Theodosian Code 9.16.9</ref> Valentinian even allowed the performance of nocturnal sacrifices, which had been previously prohibited due to the attempt of some people to practice unlawful divination under the cover of the night, after the proconsul of Greece appealed to him.<ref>Zosimus 4.3</ref>  Valentinian also confirmed the rights and privileges of the pagan priests and confirmed the right of pagans to be the exclusive caretakers of their temples.<ref>Theodosian Code 17.1.60, 17.1.75, 16.1.1</ref>  Valens, who ruled the east, was an Arian and was too engaged with fighting against the Orthodox Christians to bother much with pagans. In both west and east, severe laws were once again passed prohibiting private divination,<ref>Theodosian Code 9.16.7, 9.16.8, 9.16.10, 9.38.3, 9.38.4</ref> and haruspices and augurs began to be afraid to show themselves in public. This led the emperors to formally authorise the practice of official and lawful divination by law in 371.<ref name=\"Theodosian Code 9.16.9\"/>

==Anti-paganism policy of the emperors Gratian, Valentinian II and Theodosius I==
{{main|Anti-paganism influenced by Saint Ambrose}}
[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|right|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'', [[Anthony van Dyck]].]]

The anti-paganism policies pursued by the emperors [[Gratian]], [[Valentinian II]] and [[Theodosius I]] may have been influenced by Saint [[Ambrose]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Bishop of Milan]].<ref name=\"Byfield2003\">Byfield (2003) pp. 92-4 quote: {{quote|In the west, such [anti-pagan] tendencies were less pronounced, although the enemies of paganism had an especially influential advocate.

His restless and imperious ambition for the church's growth, come what might for the non-Christians, is suggested by his preaching.}} See also note 43 at p.163, with references to Palanque (1933), Gaudemet (1972), Matthews (1975) and King (1961)</ref><ref>Roldanus (2006) p.148</ref><ref>Hellemo (1989) p.254</ref> Under pressure from Ambrose, Theodosius issued the Theodosian Decrees of 391.<ref name=\"MacMullen1984p100\"/><ref name=\"King1961p78\">King (1961) p.78</ref> The [[Altar of Victory]] was removed by Gratian.

===Gratian===
Gratian took steps to repress [[pagan worship]]; this policy may have been influenced by his chief advisor, Ambrose, the Bishop of Milan.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06729c.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Gratian|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>\"Letter of Gratian to Ambrose,\" The Letters of Ambrose Bishop of Milan, 379 AD.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_01_letters01_10.htm]</ref><ref>Theodosian Code 2.8.18-2.8.25, 16.7.1-16.7.5</ref> In 382, Gratian appropriated the income of pagan priests and the [[Vestal Virgins]], confiscated the possessions of the priestly colleges and ordered the [[Altar of Victory]] removed again.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=J.J.|year=1966|title=The Altar of Victory – Paganism's Last Battle|journal=L'Antiquite Classique|volume=35|issue=1|page=187|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/antiq_0770-2817_1966_num_35_1_1466}}</ref><ref>Ambrose Epistles 17-18; Symmachus Relationes 1-3.</ref> The colleges of pagan priests also lost all their privileges and immunities.

===Valentinian II===
In 388 [[Valentinian II]] assumed the office of Emperor in the Western Roman Empire. He refused to grant the request from pagans to restore the Altar of Victory to the Senate House. He also refused to overturn the policies of his predecessor by restoring the income of the temple priests and Vestal Virgins. These policies may have been influenced by Ambrose.<ref>Ambrose Epistles 17, 18, 57.</ref> In the year 391, Valentinian II issued a law that prohibited sacrifices and that forbade anyone from visiting the temples.<ref name=\"TheodosianCode16.10.10\"/> A later law of Valentinian declared that pagan temples were to be closed; this was viewed as practically outlawing paganism.<ref name=\"TheodosianCode16.10.11\"/>

===Theodosius (381–395)===
{{main|Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I}}

The anti-paganism policies of [[Theodosius I]] began in 381, following the first few years of his reign over the Eastern Empire. Theodosius reiterated Constantine's ban on pagan sacrifice and [[haruspicy]] [[death penalty|on pain of death]]. He pioneered the criminalisation of Magistrates who did not enforce the anti-pagan laws. He broke up some pagan associations and destroyed pagan temples.

Between 389-391 he issued the \"Theodosian decrees\" which established a practical ban on paganism;<ref name=\"TheodosianCode16.10.11\">Theodosian Code 16.10.11</ref> visits to the temples were forbidden,<ref name=\"TheodosianCode16.10.10\">Theodosian Code 16.10.10</ref><ref name=\"Routery1997ch4\">Routery, Michael (1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/19980111141747/http://vinland.org/scamp/grove/kreich/chapter4.html ''The First Missionary War.

==Anti-paganism policies from Theodosius I until the collapse of the western empire==
{{original research|only primary sources|date=June 2019}}

Anti-paganism policies continued from Theodosius I until the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] in the west. Anti-paganism laws were instated throughout this period, by emperors including [[Arcadius]],

==After the fall of the Western Empire==
In 476, the last western emperor, [[Romulus Augustulus]], was deposed by [[Odoacer]], who became the first \"[[barbarian]]\" king of Italy. Pagans used the occasion to attempt to revive the old rites. In 484, the [[Magister militum per Orientem]], [[Illus]], revolted against Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and raised his own candidate, [[Leontius (usurper)|Leontius]], to the throne. Leontius hoped to reopen the temples and restore the ancient ceremonies; as such, many Pagans joined in his revolt against Zeno.<ref name=\"PhotiusBibliotheca242\"/> Illus and Leontius were compelled, however, to flee to a remote [[Isauria]]n fortress, where Zeno besieged them for four years. Zeno finally captured them in 488 and promptly had them executed.<ref>Theophanes Chronographia s.a. A.M. 5976-5980; John Malalas Chronicle 15.12-15.14.</ref> Following the revolt, Zeno instituted harsh anti-paganism policies. With the failure of the revolt of Leontios, some pagans became disillusioned and became Christian, or pretended to do so, in order to avoid persecution.<ref>Pagans were still sufficiently numerous during the reign of Justinian for a law to be published, in 527 (Justinian Code 1.5.12), which barred pagans from office and confiscated their property.</ref> The subjugation of the Roman Empire to Christianity became complete when the emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], who came to the throne in 491, was required to sign a written declaration of orthodoxy before his coronation.

Under [[Pope Gregory I]], the caverns, grottoes, crags and glens that had once been used for the worship of the pagan gods were now [[Cultural appropriation|appropriated]] by Christianity: \"Let altars be built and relics be placed there\" wrote [[Pope Gregory I]], \"so that [the pagans] have to change from the worship of the daemones to that of the true God.\"<ref name=\"church\">The modern Church takes a much less antagonistic stance to non-Abrahamic religions.

Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods,\" p. 278, Viking Compass, 1997.</ref></blockquote>

==Evaluation and legacy==
Except for the most recent literature, for at least the last 200 years historical scholarship has followed a conceptual scheme in which the persecution of those Mediterranean religions that we now label \"paganism\" was seen as the result of the [[religious intolerance]] inherent in the monotheistic Christian faith. The classic expression of this view occurs in the work of [[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]].'' As historian [[Harold A. Drake]] puts it, \"It is difficult to overestimate the influence of Gibbon's interpretation on subsequent scholarship.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions'', p. 8</ref>

Harold Drake takes issue with the historiography of Gibbon, arguing that while persecution certainly occurred for religious reasons, that the underlying motivation was consolidation of power in the Constantinian dynasty, which was offered in the form of promoting the cult of Christianity to the exclusion of others. He writes that \"while there is obviously some truth in the proposition that intolerance follows from the rejection of other gods that lies at the core of monotheistic belief,\" this alone could neither explain why pagans had previously persecuted Christians, nor why there were \"important voices for moderation in the early Christian community.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 5</ref> H.A. Drake writes: \"Gibbon skirts a serious problem: for three centuries prior to Constantine, the tolerant pagans who people the Decline and Fall were the authors of several major persecutions, in which Christians were the victims.\"<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions,'' p. 7</ref> Gibbon, however, implies that such an argument is in itself flawed, in that Christians later exaggerated the depth and magnitude of the persecutions against them. He argues that a diligent review of the earliest Christian source, Eusebius, reveals by his own accounting that less than one hundred Christians were executed in Palestine under [[Diocletian]] for refusing civic sacrifices as a test of their loyalty.<ref>Gibbon, Edward The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XVI, Part 8; [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/732/732-h/732-h.htm#link2HCH0008 online text] from [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>

It should be remembered, however, that early persecution of Christians did not follow the same prerogatives commonly ascribed to religious persecution in the modern sense, but rather arose from a feeling of \"otherness\" that Christians aroused in the society of the time, being adverse as they were to participating in the religious life of the Roman empire at large. Private religion, or the sacra privita, was not regulated by the state until the [[Christianization]] of the Empire, when paganism was proscribed even within the home. Private religion was the purview of the family and the individual, and varied between various ethnic groups. As such, many pagans were not opposed to Christian theology per se, but rather to the motivations of early Christians, who seemed rather \"unpatriotic\" in their isolation and aggressiveness towards other faiths. Christians were also seen as being a public embodiment of [[superstitio]]; what might be described today as [[religious zeal]], but which also had connotations of [[magical thinking]]. While this was usually regarded as a private vice, one which was commonly thought to cause mental instability, it could also been seen as dangerous to the order of society. Romans had previously ascribed superstitio to excessive practice of magic, as well as other religious groups, namely [[Druidism]] and [[Judaism]], both of which were seen as opposed to the [[interpretatio romana]], under which their public observances would be syncretised and brought into line with Roman practices. Unlike Christianity, however, these groups were not generally seen as threats to traditional Roman religious observance itself, but as obstacles to civic order and [[Romanization]].

Peter Garnsey strongly disagrees with those who describe the attitude of the \"plethora of cults\" that are labelled 'Paganism' as \"tolerant\" or \"inclusive.\"<ref>Garnsey 1984: 24</ref> What [[Ramsay MacMullen]] wrote, that in its process of expansion, the Roman Empire was \"completely tolerant, in heaven as on earth\"<ref>quoted after Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> (with the notable exceptions of the Jews, Christians and Druids), is for Garnsey a simple \"misuse of terminology.\"<ref name=\"Garnsey -25\">Garnsey 1984: 25</ref> The foreign Gods were not tolerated, but made subject together with their communities when they were conquered. The Romans \"cannot be said to have extended to them the same combination of disapproval and acceptance which is [[religious toleration|toleration]].\"<ref name=\"Garnsey -25\"/>

The example of Constantine, Theodosius and Justinian, who were seen as \"godly emperors (...) serving the church and crushing its enemies,\" has been cited repeatedly by Christian authors who endorsed an idea of [[religious persecution]].<ref>John Coffey (2000), ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558-1689'', Studies in Modern History, Pearson Education, p. 31; O. O'Donovan (1996), ''The Desire of the Nations: Rediscovering the Roots of Political Theology'', esp. ch. 6.</ref> According to the historian [[Ramsay MacMullen]], a council of bishops at Toledo in 681 called on civil authorities to seize and [[behead]] all those guilty of non-Christian practices of any sort.<ref>Ramsay MacMullen, \"Christianity & Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries,\" Chap 1:16, \"Persecution,\" {{ISBN|0-300-07148-5}}</ref> Medieval Emperor [[Charlemagne]] ruled in September 774 that the Saxons (Westfali, Ostfali, and Angrarii) must be presented with the alternative of baptism or death<ref>Thomas J. Shahan & E. Macpherson, \"Charlemagne,\" The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume III. Published 1908 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03610c.htm]</ref> and had 4,500 pagan Saxons beheaded in the [[Massacre of Verden]].
 		 	
In the 20th century, the Roman Catholic Church issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis Humanae]]\" that fully embraced the right of every human person to [[religious freedom]], as part of the [[Vatican II]] council, on 7 December 1965. On 12 March 2000, [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed publicly for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\".<ref>{{cite web |title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS |date=March 12, 2000 |accessdate=16 April 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/pages/12654_pope_john_paul_ii_asks_for_forgiveness_march_12_2000_.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023162418/http://www.sacredheart.edu/pages/12654_pope_john_paul_ii_asks_for_forgiveness_march_12_2000_.cfm |archivedate=2008-10-23}}</ref>

Hungarian politics and foreign policy had become more stridently nationalistic by 1938, and Hungary adopted an [[Irredentism|irredentist]] policy similar to Germany's, attempting to incorporate ethnic Hungarian areas in neighboring countries into Hungary. Hungary benefited territorially from its relationship with the Axis. Settlements were negotiated regarding territorial disputes with the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]], and the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. In 1940, Hungary joined the Axis powers. The following year, Hungarian forces participated in the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Their participation was noted by German observers for its particular cruelty, with occupied peoples subjected to arbitrary violence. Hungarian volunteers were sometimes referred to as engaging in \"murder tourism.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ungváry|first=Krisztián|date=2007-03-23|title=Hungarian Occupation Forces in the Ukraine 1941–1942: The Historiographical Context|journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=81–120|doi=10.1080/13518040701205480|issn=1351-8046}}</ref>

While waging war against the [[Soviet Union]], Hungary engaged in [[armistice]] negotiations with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Hitler discovered this betrayal, and in March 1944, [[Operation Margarethe|German forces occupied Hungary]]. When Soviet forces began threatening Hungary, an armistice was signed between Hungary and the USSR by Regent [[Miklós Horthy]]. Soon afterward, Horthy's son was kidnapped by German commandos and Horthy was forced to revoke the armistice. The Regent was then deposed from power, while Hungarian fascist leader [[Ferenc Szálasi]] established a new government, with German backing. In 1945, Hungarian and German forces in Hungary were defeated by advancing Soviet armies.

Approximately 300,000 Hungarian soldiers and more than 600,000 civilians died during World War II, including among them more than 400,000 [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jews]] and 28,000 [[Roma in Hungary|Roma]]. Many cities were damaged, most notably the capital [[Budapest]]. Most Jews in Hungary were protected from deportation to German [[extermination camp]]s for the first few years of the war, although they had for a longer period been subjected to a series of anti-Jewish laws which imposed limits on Jewish participation in Hungary's public and economic life.<ref>Pogany, Istvan, ''Righting Wrongs in Eastern Europe'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pp.26–39, 80–94.</ref> From the start of the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, Jews and Roma were deported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

==Movement to the right==
[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|left|The partition of [[Hungary]] in accordance with the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. This unwelcome political division dominated the political life of Hungary during the [[Interwar period|period]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]]]
In [[Hungary]], the joint effect of the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] resulted in shifting the political mood of the country towards the [[Right-wing politics|right]]. In 1932, the regent [[Miklós Horthy]] appointed a new Prime Minister, [[Gyula Gömbös]]. Gömbös was identified with the [[Hungarian National Defence Association]] (''Magyar Országos Véderő Egylet'', or MOVE). He led Hungarian international policy towards closer cooperation with Germany, and started an [[Magyarization|effort to assimilate minorities]] in Hungary. Gömbös signed a trade agreement with Germany (21 February 1934)<ref>'2. Zusatzvertrag zum deutsch-ungarischen Wirtschaftsabkommen von 1931 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=lefKBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155 Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104081226/https://books.google.de/books?id=lefKBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155 |date=4 November 2016 }})</ref> that led to fast expansion of the economy, drawing Hungary out of the Great Depression but making the country dependent on the German economy for both raw materials<!--which ?--> and export revenues.

Gömbös advocated a number of social reforms, [[One-party state|one-party government]]{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}, revision of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], and Hungary's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]. Although he assembled a strong political machine, his efforts to achieve his vision and reforms were frustrated by a parliament composed mostly of [[István Bethlen]]'s supporters and by Hungary's creditors, who forced Gömbös to follow conventional policies in dealing with the economic and financial crisis. The result of the 1935 elections gave Gömbös more solid support in [[Parliament of Hungary|parliament]]. He succeeded in gaining control of the ministries of finance, industry, and defense and in replacing several key military officers with his supporters. In October 1936, he died due to kidney problems without realizing his goals.

Hungary used its relationship with Germany to attempt to revise the Treaty of Trianon. In 1938, Hungary openly repudiated the treaty's restrictions on its armed forces. [[Adolf Hitler]] gave promises to return lost territories and threats of military intervention and economic pressure to encourage the Hungarian Government to support the policies and goals of Nazi Germany. In 1935, a Hungarian fascist party, the [[Arrow Cross Party]], led by [[Ferenc Szálasi]] was founded. Gömbös' successor, [[Kálmán Darányi]], attempted to appease both Nazis and Hungarian [[antisemitism|antisemites]] by passing the First Jewish Law, which set quotas limiting Jews to 20% of positions in several professions. The law satisfied neither the Nazis nor Hungary's own radicals, and when Darányi resigned in May 1938 [[Béla Imrédy]] was appointed Prime Minister.

[[File:Pál Teleki 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pál Teleki]], prime minister of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1921 and 1939–1941)]]
Imrédy's attempts to improve Hungary's diplomatic relations with the [[United Kingdom]] initially made him very unpopular with Germany and Italy. Aware of Germany's [[Anschluss]] with Austria in March, he realized that he could not afford to alienate Germany and Italy on a long term basis: in the autumn of 1938 his foreign policy became very much pro-German and pro-Italian.<ref name=\"Montgomery\" /> Intent on amassing a powerbase in Hungarian right wing politics, Imrédy started to suppress political rivals, so the increasingly influential Arrow Cross Party was harassed, and eventually banned by Imrédy's administration. As Imrédy drifted further to the right, he proposed that the government be reorganized along [[totalitarian]] lines and drafted a harsher Second Jewish Law. Imrédy's political opponents, however, forced his resignation in February 1939 by presenting documents showing that his grandfather was a Jew. Nevertheless, the new government of Count [[Pál Teleki]] approved the Second Jewish Law, which cut the quotas on Jews permitted in the professions and in business. Furthermore, the new law defined Jews by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] instead of just religion, thus altering the status of those who had formerly [[religious conversion|converted]] from [[Judaism]] to [[Christianity]].

==Territorial expansion==
[[File:TeritorialGainsHungary1920-41.svg|235px|thumb|Territories that Hungary gained back with the Vienna Awards and military occupation (1938–1941)]]
[[File:Hungary 1941 ethnic.svg|thumb|235px|Ethnic make-up of post-1941 Hungary]]
[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] sought to peacefully enforce the claims of Hungarians on territories Hungary had lost with the signing of the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Two significant territorial awards were made. These awards were known as the [[First Vienna Award]] and the [[Second Vienna Award]].

In October 1938, the [[Munich Agreement]] caused the dissolution of the [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1938)|Czechoslovak Republic]] and the creation of the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czech-Slovak Republic]] (also known as the \"Second Czechoslovak Republic\"). Some autonomy was granted to Slovakia and to [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] in the new republic. On 5 October, about 500 members of the Hungarian [[Rongyos Gárda|Ragged Guard]] infiltrated Slovakia and Ruthenia as \"[[guerrillas]]\". On 9 October, the Kingdom of Hungary started talks with the Czecho-Slovak Republic over Magyar-populated regions of southern Slovakia and southern Ruthenia. On 11 October, the Hungarian guards were defeated by Czecho-Slovak troops at [[Berehove|Berehovo]] and Borzsava in Ruthenia. The Hungarians suffered approximately 350 casualties and, by 29 October, the talks were deadlocked.<ref name=\"Thomas, pg. 11\">Thomas, ''The Royal Hungarian Army in World War II'', pg. 11</ref>

===First Vienna Award===
On 2 November 1938, the [[First Vienna Award]] transferred to Hungary parts of southern Slovakia and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] from Czechoslovakia, an area amounting to 11,927&nbsp;km² and a population of 869,299 (86.5% of which were Hungarians<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/2vhSzakkonyv-magyarok-a-ii-vilaghaboruban-2/a-delvideki-hadmuvelet-1941-aprilis-874/tendenciak-a-ket-vilaghaboru-kozott-88B/az-elso-becsi-dontes-szovege-8AB/ |title=AZ ELSŐ BÉCSI DÖNTÉS SZÖVEGE |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.arcanum.hu |publisher=Arcanum Adatbázis Kft. |language=hu}}</ref>). Between 5 and 10 November, Hungarian armed forces occupied the newly transferred territories.<ref name=\"Thomas, pg. 11\"/>

===Occupation of Carpatho-Ukraine===
In March 1939, the Czecho-Slovak Republic was dissolved, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded it]], and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was established. On 14 March, [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovakia]] declared itself to be an independent state. On 15 March, [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] declared itself to be an independent state. Hungary rejected the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine and, between 14 and 18 March, Hungarian armed forces occupied the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia and ousted the government of [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]]. By contrast, Hungary recognized the German [[puppet state]] of Slovakia led by the [[Clerical fascism|Clerical Fascist]] [[Jozef Tiso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3430.htm|title=Slovakia|work=U.S. Department of State|df=}}</ref> But on 23 March 1939, Hungarian attacks Slovakia on the east claiming a border dispute, led to a localized armed conflict between the two countries. The [[Slovak–Hungarian War]], also known as the \"Little War\", ended with Hungary gaining the easternmost strip of Slovakia, 1697&nbsp;km².

===Second Vienna Award===
In September 1940, with troops massing on both sides of the Hungarian-Romanian border, war was averted by the [[Second Vienna Award]]. This award transferred to Hungary the northern half of [[Transylvania]], with a total area of 43,492&nbsp;km² and a total population of 2,578,100 divided more or less evenly between Hungarians and Romanians (depending on the census, cf. [[Second Vienna Award#Statistics|Second Vienna Award]]). By dividing Transylvania between Romania and Hungary, Hitler was able to ease tensions in both countries.

===Occupation and annexation of Yugoslav territories===
{{main article|Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories}}
After [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invading Yugoslavia]] on 11 April 1941, Hungary annexed sections of [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]], [[Bačka]], [[Međimurje]], and [[Prekmurje]].<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html Hungary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203003152/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html |date=3 February 2007 }} – Shoah Foundation Institute Visual History Archive</ref> The returned territories – 11417&nbsp;km² – had a population of 1,025,508 which comprised 36.6 % Hungarians, 19 % Germans, 16% Serbs and 28.4% others.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Lexikonok-magyarorszag-a-masodik-vilaghaboruban-lexikon-a-zs-F062E/d-F088D/delvidek-visszacsatolasa-F08AB/ |title=Délvidék visszacsatolása |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.arcanum.hu |publisher=Arcanum Adatbázis Kft. |language=hu }}</ref>

==Administration of Greater Hungary==
{{Main article|Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary (1941–44)}}
[[File:Kingdom of Hungary 1944 44 Varmegye.png|right|thumb|320px|Kingdom of Hungary 1941–44]]
Following the two Vienna awards, a number of counties that had been lost in whole or part by the [[Trianon peace treaty|Treaty of Trianon]] were restored to Hungary. As a result, some previously ''county of temporary united administration'' – in Hungarian ''közigazgatásilag egyelőre egyesített vármegye'' (k.e.e. vm.) – were de-merged and restored to their pre-1920 boundaries.

The region of [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Sub-Carpathia]] was planned to be granted a special autonomous status with the intention that (eventually) it would be self-governed by the Ruthenian minority. This was prepared and billed in the Hungarian Parliament, but in the end, after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] it never passed through.<ref>Géza Vasas – A ruszin autonómia válaszútjain (1939. március-szeptember) – On  the crossroads of Ruthenian autonomy (March–September 1939), [http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/40971/1/aetas_2000_004_064-088.pdf]</ref> However, in the corresponding territory the Governorate of Subcarpathia was formed which was divided into three, the ''administrative branch offices'' of Ung ({{lang-hu|Ungi közigazgatási kirendeltség}}), Bereg ({{lang-hu|Beregi közigazgatási kirendeltség}}) and Máramaros ({{lang-hu|Máramarosi közigazgatási kirendeltség}}), having [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Rusyn language]] as official languages.

==Military campaigns==
===Invasion of Yugoslavia===
{{Main article|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}
On 20 November 1940, under pressure from Germany, Hungarian prime Minister [[Pál Teleki]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. In December 1940, Teleki also signed an ephemeral \"[[Treaty of Eternal Friendship (1940)|Treaty of Eternal Friendship]]\" with the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. At that time, Yugoslavia was under a [[Regent]], [[Pavle Karadjordjevic|Prince Paul]] who was also under German pressure.

On 25 March 1941, Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact on behalf of Yugoslavia. Two days later, a Yugoslavian ''[[coup d'état]]'' removed Prince Paul, replaced him with pro-[[United Kingdom|British]] [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]], and threatened the success of the planned [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]].

Hitler asked the Hungarians to support his invasion of Yugoslavia. He promised to return some territory to Hungary in exchange for military cooperation. On 3 April 1941, unable to prevent Hungary's participation in the war alongside Germany, Teleki committed suicide. The right-wing radical [[László Bárdossy]] succeeded him as Prime Minister.

Three days after Teleki's death, the [[Luftwaffe]] [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|bombed Belgrade]] without warning. The German Army invaded Yugoslavia and quickly crushed Yugoslavian armed resistance. Horthy dispatched the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Third Army]] to [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|occupy Vojvodina]].

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===
[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank used during the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.]]
Hungary did not immediately participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. The invasion began on 22 June 1941, but Hitler did not directly ask for Hungarian assistance. Nonetheless, many Hungarian officials argued for participation in the war in order to encourage Hitler not to favour Romania in the event of border revisions in Transylvania. On 26 June 1941, the Soviet air force [[Bombing of Kassa|bombed Košice]] (Kassa). Some speculation exists that this was a \"[[false-flag operation|false-flag]]\" attack instigated by Germany (possibly in cooperation with Romania) to give Hungary  a ''[[casus belli]]'' for joining [[Operation Barbarossa]] and the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dreisziger|first=N.F.|year=1972 |title=New Twist to an Old Riddle: The Bombing of Kassa (Košice), June 26, 1941|journal=The Journal of Modern History| publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=44|issue=2|doi= 10.1086/240751|pages=232–242}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/history/av2ww/axis/koshice/koshice.html|title=Бомбежка Кошице|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015050353/http://airwar.ru/history/av2ww/axis/koshice/koshice.html|archivedate=15 October 2011|language=ru}}</ref> Hungary declared war against the Soviets on 27 June 1941.

On 1 July 1941, under German instruction, the Hungarian \"Carpathian Group\" (''[[Gyors-hadtest|Karpat Group]]'') attacked the [[12th Army (Soviet Union)|12th Soviet Army]]. Attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]], the Karpat Group advanced far into Soviet Ukraine, and, later, southern Russia. At the [[Battle of Uman]], fought between 3 and 8 August, the Karpat Group's mechanized corps acted as one half of a pincer that encircled the [[6th Army (Soviet Union)|6th Soviet Army]] and the 12th Soviet Army. Twenty Soviet divisions were captured or destroyed in this action.

In July 1941, the Hungarian government transferred responsibility for 18,000 Jews from Carpato-Ruthenian Hungary to the German armed forces. These Jews, without Hungarian citizenship, were sent to a location near [[Kamenets-Podolski]], where in one of the first acts of mass killing of Jews during World War II, all but [[Kamianets-Podilskyi Massacre|two thousand of these individuals were shot]] by [[Einsatzgruppe|Nazi mobile killing units]].<ref name=\"HDKE\">[http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070101&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=b39689db307eea957accaa1d04e4c330The Holocaust in Hungary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609154602/http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070101&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=b39689db307eea957accaa1d04e4c330The |date=9 June 2011 }} Holocaust Memorial Centre.</ref><ref name=holocaust>{{cite web|title=Hungary Before the German Occupation|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?ModuleId=10005457|accessdate=22 September 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65s7Q60Wf?url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005457|archivedate=2 March 2012}}</ref> Bárdossy then passed the \"Third Jewish Law\" in August 1941, prohibiting marriage and sexual intercourse of Hungarians with Jews.

Six months after the mass murder at Kamianets-Podilskyi in January 1942, Hungarian troops [[Novi Sad raid|massacred]] 3,000 Serbian and Jewish hostages near [[Novi Sad]], Yugoslavia.

Worried about Hungary's increasing reliance on Germany, Admiral Horthy forced Bárdossy to resign and replaced him with [[Miklós Kállay]], a veteran conservative of Bethlen's government. Kállay continued Bárdossy's policy of supporting Germany against the Red Army while also initiating negotiations with the Western Allies. Hungarian participation in Operation Barbarossa during 1941 was limited in part because the country had no real large army before 1939, and time to train and equip troops had been short. But by 1942, tens of thousands of Hungarians were fighting on the eastern front in the [[Royal Hungarian Army]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-680-8283A-12A, Budapest, marschierende Pfeilkreuzler und Panzer VI.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hungarian Arrow Cross army/militia and a German [[Tiger II]] tank in Budapest, October 1944.]]
During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]] suffered terrible losses. The Soviet breakthrough at the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] sliced directly through the Hungarian units. Shortly after the fall of Stalingrad in January 1943, the Hungarian 2nd Army was crushed by the Soviets at the [[Battle of Voronezh (1943)|Battle of Voronezh]]. Ignoring German orders to stand and fight to the death, the bewildered Hungarian troops, fighting without antitank weaponry or armored support, turned and fled. Harassed by partisan groups and Soviet air attacks, and having to endure the Russian winter weather, they tried in vain to retreat. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner by the Soviet army, and total casualties numbered more than 100,000 men. The [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian army]] ceased to exist as an effective fighting force, and the Germans pulled them from the front.

While Kállay was Prime Minister, the Jews endured increased economic and [[political repression]], although many, particularly those in Budapest, were temporarily protected from the [[final solution]]. For most of the war, the Hungarian Jews lived an uneasy existence. They were deprived of most freedoms, but were not subjected to physical harm, and Horthy tried to contain anti-Semitic groups like the Arrow Cross. Secret negotiations with the British and Americans continued. As per the request of the Western Allies, there were no connections made with the Soviets.

===German occupation of Hungary===
[[File:Hungary, Budapest Fortepan 72907.jpg|thumb|Propaganda posters in Budapest, 1944]]
Aware of Kállay's deceit and fearing that Hungary might conclude a separate peace, in March 1944, Hitler launched [[Operation Margarethe]] and ordered Nazi troops to occupy Hungary. Horthy was confined to a castle, in essence, placed under [[house arrest]]. [[Döme Sztójay]], an avid supporter of the National Socialists, became the new Prime Minister.  Sztójay governed with the aid of a National Socialist military governor, [[Edmund Veesenmayer]]. The Hungarian populace was not happy with their nation being reduced in effect to a German protectorate, but Berlin threatened to occupy Hungary with [[Slovak Republic (1939–45)|Slovak]], [[NDH|Croat]], and Romanian troops if they did not comply. The thought of these ancestral enemies on Hungarian soil was seen as far worse than German control. Ironically, Hungary still kept whole divisions on the border with Romania even as the troops of both nations were fighting and dying together in the Russian winter.

As the Soviets pushed westward, Sztojay's government proceeded to muster new armies. The Hungarian troops again suffered terrible losses, but now had a motive to protect their homeland from Soviet occupation.

In August 1944, Horthy replaced Sztójay with the anti-Fascist General [[Géza Lakatos]]. Under the Lakatos regime, acting Interior Minister [[Béla Horváth]] ordered Hungarian [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] to prevent any Hungarian citizens from being deported. The Germans were unhappy with the situation, but could not do a great deal about it. Horthy's actions thus bought the Jews of Budapest a few months of time.

===Soviet occupation of Hungary===
[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|right|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in 1944.]]
{{details|Siege of Budapest}}
In September 1944, Soviet forces crossed the Hungarian border. On 15 October, Horthy announced that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. The Hungarian army ignored the armistice, fighting desperately to keep the Soviets out. The Germans launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and, by kidnapping his son [[Miklós Horthy Jr.]], forced Horthy to abrogate the armistice, depose the Lakatos government, and name the leader of the [[Arrow Cross Party]], [[Ferenc Szálasi]], as Prime Minister.  Horthy resigned and Szálasi became Prime Minister of a new \"[[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]]\" (''Nemzeti Összefogás Kormánya'') controlled by the Germans. Horthy himself was taken to Germany as a prisoner. He ultimately survived the war and spent his last years exiled in Portugal, dying in 1957.

In cooperation with the Nazis, Szálasi attempted to resume deportations of Jews, but Germany's fast-disintegrating communications largely prevented this from happening. Nonetheless, the Arrow Cross launched a reign of terror against the Jews of Budapest. Thousands were tortured, raped and murdered in the last months of the war, and their property looted or destroyed. Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] saved thousands of Budapest Jews using Swedish protective passports. He was ultimately taken prisoner by the Soviets and died some years later in a labor camp. Other foreign diplomats like [[Nuncio]] [[Angelo Rotta]], [[Giorgio Perlasca]], [[Carl Lutz]], [[Friedrich Born]], [[Harald Feller]], [[Angel Sanz Briz]] and [[George Mandel-Mantello]] also organized false papers and safe houses for Jews in Budapest. Of the approximately 800,000 Jews residing within Hungary's expanded borders of 1941, only 200,000 (about 25%) survived [[the Holocaust]].<ref>[http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070102&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=41e4d6b481e6ac01d487afa1b38b615c Victims of Holocaust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311005711/http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070102&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=41e4d6b481e6ac01d487afa1b38b615c |date=11 March 2008 }} – Holocaust Memorial Centre. </ref> An estimated 28,000 Hungarian Roma were also killed as part of the [[Porajmos]].

Soon Hungary itself became a battlefield. Szálasi promised [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|a Greater Hungary]] and prosperity for the peasants, but in reality Hungary was crumbling and its armies were slowly being destroyed. As an integral part of German General [[Maximilian Fretter-Pico]]'s ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'', the re-formed [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]] enjoyed a modest level of combat success.  From 6 to 29 October 1944, during the [[Battle of Debrecen]], ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'' managed to achieve a major win on the battlefield. Avoiding encirclement itself, ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'' encircled and severely mauled three Soviet tank corps serving under the Mobile Group of [[Issa Pliyev]]. Earlier in the same battle, Mobile Group Pliyev had sliced through the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Third Army]]. But success was costly and, unable to replace lost armor and heavy artillery munitions, the Hungarian Second Army was defeated on 1 December 1944.  The remnants of the Second Army were incorporated into the Third Army.

In October 1944, the [[First Army (Hungary)|Hungarian First Army]] was attached to the German [[1st Panzer Army]], participating defensively against the Red Army's advance towards [[Budapest]]. On 28 December 1944, a provisional government was formed in Hungary under acting Prime Minister [[Béla Miklós]]. Miklós and Szálasi each claimed to be the legitimate Head of government. The Germans and pro-German Hungarians loyal to Szálasi fought on.

The Soviets and Romanians completed the encirclement of Budapest on 29 December 1944. The battle for the city turned into the [[Siege of Budapest]]. During the fight, most of what remained of the Hungarian First Army was destroyed about {{convert|200|km}} north of Budapest in a running battle from 1 January to 16 February 1945. On 20 January 1945, representatives of the Miklós provisional government signed an armistice in Moscow. In January 1945, 32,000 ethnic Germans from within Hungary were arrested and transported to the Soviet Union as forced laborers. In some villages, the entire adult population were taken to labor camps in the [[Donets Basin]].<ref name=Wasserstein>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/refugees_01.shtml#two |title=European Refugee Movements After World War Two |last=Wasserstein |first=Bernard |date=17 February 2011 |website=[[BBC]]history |accessdate=5 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719052812/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/refugees_01.shtml#two |archivedate=19 July 2013 }}

The remaining German and Hungarian units within Budapest surrendered on 13 February 1945. Although the German forces in Hungary were generally defeated, the Germans had one more surprise for the Soviets. On 6 March 1945, the Germans launched the [[Operation Frühlingserwachen|Lake Balaton Offensive]], attempting to hold on to the Axis' last source of oil. It was their final operation of the war and it quickly failed. By 19 March 1945, Soviet troops had recaptured all the territory lost during the 13-day German offensive.<ref name=\"dollinger\">''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan'', Hans Dollinger, Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 67-27047</ref>{{rp|182}}

After the failed offensive, the Germans in Hungary were eliminated. Most of what remained of the Hungarian Third Army was destroyed about {{convert|50|km}} west of Budapest between 16 and 25 March 1945. From 26 March and 15 April, the Soviets and Bulgarians launched the [[Nagykanizsa–Körmend Offensive]] and more Hungarian remnants were destroyed as part of [[Army Group South]] fighting alongside the [[2nd Panzer Army]]. By the start of April, the Germans, with the Arrow Cross in tow, had completely vacated Hungarian soil.

===Retreat into Germany===
[[File:Hungarian soldies in Denmark 2. World War.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Hungarian soldiers in Denmark, April 1945.]]
Officially, Soviet operations in Hungary ended on 4 April 1945, when the last German troops were expelled. Some pro-Fascist Hungarians like Szálasi escaped—for a time—with the Germans.  A few pro-German Hungarian units fought on until the end of the war. Units like the [[Szent László Infantry Division]] ended the war in southern [[Austria]].

On 8 May 1945, at 4:10&nbsp;p.m. Major General [[Stanley Eric Reinhart]]'s 259th Infantry Regiment was authorized to accept the surrender of the 1st Hungarian Cavalry Division and of the 1st Hungarian Panzer Division. Surrender and movement across the [[Enns (river)|Enns River]] had to be completed prior to midnight.

In the town of [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]] in [[Bavaria]], a Hungarian garrison stood in parade formation to surrender as the Americans advanced through the area very late in the war.<ref>Stafford, ''Endgame, 1945'', p. 242.</ref> A few Hungarian soldiers ended the war in [[Denmark]] in some of the last Nazi territory not yet occupied.

===The Holocaust===
{{further|The Holocaust in Hungary}}
On 19 March 1944 German troops occupied Hungary, prime minister Miklós Kállay was deposed and soon mass deportations of Jews to German [[death camps]] in [[occupied Poland]] began. SS-[[Obersturmbannführer]] [[Adolf Eichmann]] went to Hungary to oversee the large-scale deportations. Between 15 May and 9 July, Hungarian authorities deported 437,402 Jews. All but 15,000 of these Jews were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]],<ref name=\"HDKE\"/> and 90% of those were immediately killed. It has been estimated that one-third of the murdered victims at Auschwitz were Hungarian.<ref>Gábor Kádár – Zoltán Vági: Magyarok Auschwitzban. (Hungarians in Auschwitz) In Holocaust Füzetek 12. Budapest, 1999, Magyar Auschwitz Alapítvány-Holocaust Dokumentációs Központ, pp. 92–123.</ref> Sztojay, unlike previous prime ministers, answered mostly to Berlin and was thus able to act independently of Horthy. However, reports of the conditions in the concentration camps led the admiral to resist his policies.

In early July 1944, Horthy stopped the deportations, and after the failed attempt on Hitler's life, the Germans backed off from pressing Horthy's regime to continue further, large-scale deportations, although some smaller groups continued to be deported by train. In late August, Horthy refused Eichmann's request to restart the deportations. Himmler ordered Eichmann to leave Budapest.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robert J.

===Forced labor===
The [[Labour service (Hungary)|forced labor service]] system was introduced in Hungary in 1939. The system affected primarily the Jewish population, but many people belonging to minorities, sectarians, leftists and Roma were also inducted.

Thirty-five thousand to 40,000 forced laborers, mostly Jews or of Jewish origin, served in the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]], which fought in the USSR (see below). Eighty percent of them—28,000 to 32,000 people—never returned; they died either on the battlefield or in captivity.

Approximately half of the 6,000 Jewish forced laborers working in the copper mines in [[Bor, Serbia|Bor]], Yugoslavia (now [[Serbia]]) were executed by the Germans during the [[death march]] from Bor to Győr in August–October 1944, including the 35-year-old poet [[Miklós Radnóti]], shot at the Hungarian village of [[Abda, Hungary|Abda]] for being too weak to continue after a savage beating.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Martin |title=Atlas of the Holocaust |year=1988 |publisher=Lester Publishing Limited |location=Toronto |isbn=1-895555-37-X |pages=10, 206}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.m30afilms.com/page2/page8/page8.html |title=Neither Memory Nor Magic: The Life and Times of Miklos Radnoti |last=Perez |first=Hugo |year=2008 |publisher=M30A Films |accessdate=5 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009164804/http://m30afilms.com/page2/page8/page8.html |archivedate=9 October 2013 }}</ref>

==Resistance movement==
In autumn of 1941 anti-German demonstrations took place in Hungary. On 15 March 1942, the anniversary of the outbreak of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|1848–49 War of Independence]], a crowd of 8,000 people gathered at the [[Sándor Petőfi]] monument in Budapest to demand an \"independent democratic Hungary\". The underground [[Hungarian Communist Party]] published newspaper and leaflets, 500 communist activists were arrested and the party's leaders [[Ferenc Rózsa]] and [[Zoltán Schönherz]] were executed.

The Hungarian underground opposition contributed little to the military defeat of National Socialism. In July 1943 the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Smallholders Party]] adopted [[Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky]]'s policy of working more closely with [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]]
and the Communists and on 31 July demanded from the government an end to hostilities and joining the Allies even at the price of armed conflict with Germany. At the beginning of August 1943 a programme of action was formally concluded with the Social Democrats and on 11 September they issued a joint declaration against the war on the side of Germany.

Various opposition groups deprived of their leaders most of whom had been arrested by the [[Gestapo]] after the German occupation in March 1944 joined forces in May 1944 in the Communist-inspired [[Hungarian Front]] (Magyar Front). They demanded a \"new struggle of liberation\" against the German occupation forces and their collaborators and called for the creation of a new democratic Hungary after the war. The representatives of the Hungarian Front, being informed by Horthy of plans for an armistice on 11 October, founded the [[Committee of Liberation of the Hungarian National Uprising]] on 11 November 1944. Although immediately weakened by the arrest and execution of its leaders, it called for an armed uprising against the German forces which took the form of limited isolated partisan actions and attacks on German military installations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Ungarn/modhunhist_IV.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF HUNGARY|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506034034/http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Ungarn/modhunhist_IV.htm|archivedate=6 May 2016}}</ref>

==Peace treaty==
{{See also|End of World War II in Europe|Beneš decrees}}
By 2 May 1945, Hitler was dead and [[Berlin]] surrendered. On 7 May, General [[Alfred Jodl]], the German Chief of Staff, signed the [[surrender of Germany]]. On 23 May, the \"[[Flensburg government|Flensburg Government]]\" was dissolved. On 11 June, the Allies agreed to make 8 May 1945 the official \"[[Victory in Europe Day|Victory in Europe]]\" day.<ref name=\"dollinger\"/>{{rp|298}}

Two thirds of the ethnic German minority (202,000 people) was deported to Germany in 1946–48, and there was a forced \"[[Czechoslovak-Hungarian population exchange|population exchange]]\" between Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

On 1 February 1946, the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] was formally abolished and replaced by the [[Second Republic of Hungary]]. Post-war Hungary was eventually taken over by a Soviet-allied government and became part of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The [[People's Republic of Hungary]] was declared in 1949 and lasted until the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[End of Communism in Hungary (1989)|End of Communism in Hungary]].

Hungarian politics and foreign policy had become more stridently nationalistic by 1938, and Hungary adopted an [[Irredentism|irredentist]] policy similar to Germany's, attempting to incorporate ethnic Hungarian areas in neighboring countries into Hungary. Hungary benefited territorially from its relationship with the Axis. Settlements were negotiated regarding territorial disputes with the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]], and the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. In 1940, Hungary joined the Axis powers. The following year, Hungarian forces participated in the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Their participation was noted by German observers for its particular cruelty, with occupied peoples subjected to arbitrary violence. Hungarian volunteers were sometimes referred to as engaging in \"murder tourism.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ungváry|first=Krisztián|date=2007-03-23|title=Hungarian Occupation Forces in the Ukraine 1941–1942: The Historiographical Context|journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=81–120|doi=10.1080/13518040701205480|issn=1351-8046}}</ref>

While waging war against the [[Soviet Union]], Hungary engaged in [[armistice]] negotiations with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Hitler discovered this betrayal, and in March 1944, [[Operation Margarethe|German forces occupied Hungary]]. When Soviet forces began threatening Hungary, an armistice was signed between Hungary and the USSR by Regent [[Miklós Horthy]]. Soon afterward, Horthy's son was kidnapped by German commandos and Horthy was forced to revoke the armistice. The Regent was then deposed from power, while Hungarian fascist leader [[Ferenc Szálasi]] established a new government, with German backing. In 1945, Hungarian and German forces in Hungary were defeated by advancing Soviet armies.

Approximately 300,000 Hungarian soldiers and more than 600,000 civilians died during World War II, including among them more than 400,000 [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jews]] and 28,000 [[Roma in Hungary|Roma]]. Many cities were damaged, most notably the capital [[Budapest]]. Most Jews in Hungary were protected from deportation to German [[extermination camp]]s for the first few years of the war, although they had for a longer period been subjected to a series of anti-Jewish laws which imposed limits on Jewish participation in Hungary's public and economic life.<ref>Pogany, Istvan, ''Righting Wrongs in Eastern Europe'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pp.26–39, 80–94.</ref> From the start of the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, Jews and Roma were deported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

==Movement to the right==
[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|left|The partition of [[Hungary]] in accordance with the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. This unwelcome political division dominated the political life of Hungary during the [[Interwar period|period]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]]]
In [[Hungary]], the joint effect of the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] resulted in shifting the political mood of the country towards the [[Right-wing politics|right]]. In 1932, the regent [[Miklós Horthy]] appointed a new Prime Minister, [[Gyula Gömbös]]. Gömbös was identified with the [[Hungarian National Defence Association]] (''Magyar Országos Véderő Egylet'', or MOVE). He led Hungarian international policy towards closer cooperation with Germany, and started an [[Magyarization|effort to assimilate minorities]] in Hungary. Gömbös signed a trade agreement with Germany (21 February 1934)<ref>'2. Zusatzvertrag zum deutsch-ungarischen Wirtschaftsabkommen von 1931 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=lefKBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155 Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104081226/https://books.google.de/books?id=lefKBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155 |date=4 November 2016 }})</ref> that led to fast expansion of the economy, drawing Hungary out of the Great Depression but making the country dependent on the German economy for both raw materials<!--which ?--> and export revenues.

Gömbös advocated a number of social reforms, [[One-party state|one-party government]]{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}, revision of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], and Hungary's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]. Although he assembled a strong political machine, his efforts to achieve his vision and reforms were frustrated by a parliament composed mostly of [[István Bethlen]]'s supporters and by Hungary's creditors, who forced Gömbös to follow conventional policies in dealing with the economic and financial crisis. The result of the 1935 elections gave Gömbös more solid support in [[Parliament of Hungary|parliament]]. He succeeded in gaining control of the ministries of finance, industry, and defense and in replacing several key military officers with his supporters. In October 1936, he died due to kidney problems without realizing his goals.

Hungary used its relationship with Germany to attempt to revise the Treaty of Trianon. In 1938, Hungary openly repudiated the treaty's restrictions on its armed forces. [[Adolf Hitler]] gave promises to return lost territories and threats of military intervention and economic pressure to encourage the Hungarian Government to support the policies and goals of Nazi Germany. In 1935, a Hungarian fascist party, the [[Arrow Cross Party]], led by [[Ferenc Szálasi]] was founded. Gömbös' successor, [[Kálmán Darányi]], attempted to appease both Nazis and Hungarian [[antisemitism|antisemites]] by passing the First Jewish Law, which set quotas limiting Jews to 20% of positions in several professions. The law satisfied neither the Nazis nor Hungary's own radicals, and when Darányi resigned in May 1938 [[Béla Imrédy]] was appointed Prime Minister.

[[File:Pál Teleki 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pál Teleki]], prime minister of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1921 and 1939–1941)]]
Imrédy's attempts to improve Hungary's diplomatic relations with the [[United Kingdom]] initially made him very unpopular with Germany and Italy. Aware of Germany's [[Anschluss]] with Austria in March, he realized that he could not afford to alienate Germany and Italy on a long term basis: in the autumn of 1938 his foreign policy became very much pro-German and pro-Italian.<ref name=\"Montgomery\" /> Intent on amassing a powerbase in Hungarian right wing politics, Imrédy started to suppress political rivals, so the increasingly influential Arrow Cross Party was harassed, and eventually banned by Imrédy's administration. As Imrédy drifted further to the right, he proposed that the government be reorganized along [[totalitarian]] lines and drafted a harsher Second Jewish Law. Imrédy's political opponents, however, forced his resignation in February 1939 by presenting documents showing that his grandfather was a Jew. Nevertheless, the new government of Count [[Pál Teleki]] approved the Second Jewish Law, which cut the quotas on Jews permitted in the professions and in business. Furthermore, the new law defined Jews by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] instead of just religion, thus altering the status of those who had formerly [[religious conversion|converted]] from [[Judaism]] to [[Christianity]].

==Territorial expansion==
[[File:TeritorialGainsHungary1920-41.svg|235px|thumb|Territories that Hungary gained back with the Vienna Awards and military occupation (1938–1941)]]
[[File:Hungary 1941 ethnic.svg|thumb|235px|Ethnic make-up of post-1941 Hungary]]
[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] sought to peacefully enforce the claims of Hungarians on territories Hungary had lost with the signing of the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Two significant territorial awards were made. These awards were known as the [[First Vienna Award]] and the [[Second Vienna Award]].

In October 1938, the [[Munich Agreement]] caused the dissolution of the [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1938)|Czechoslovak Republic]] and the creation of the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czech-Slovak Republic]] (also known as the \"Second Czechoslovak Republic\"). Some autonomy was granted to Slovakia and to [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] in the new republic. On 5 October, about 500 members of the Hungarian [[Rongyos Gárda|Ragged Guard]] infiltrated Slovakia and Ruthenia as \"[[guerrillas]]\". On 9 October, the Kingdom of Hungary started talks with the Czecho-Slovak Republic over Magyar-populated regions of southern Slovakia and southern Ruthenia. On 11 October, the Hungarian guards were defeated by Czecho-Slovak troops at [[Berehove|Berehovo]] and Borzsava in Ruthenia. The Hungarians suffered approximately 350 casualties and, by 29 October, the talks were deadlocked.<ref name=\"Thomas, pg. 11\">Thomas, ''The Royal Hungarian Army in World War II'', pg. 11</ref>

===First Vienna Award===
On 2 November 1938, the [[First Vienna Award]] transferred to Hungary parts of southern Slovakia and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] from Czechoslovakia, an area amounting to 11,927&nbsp;km² and a population of 869,299 (86.5% of which were Hungarians<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/2vhSzakkonyv-magyarok-a-ii-vilaghaboruban-2/a-delvideki-hadmuvelet-1941-aprilis-874/tendenciak-a-ket-vilaghaboru-kozott-88B/az-elso-becsi-dontes-szovege-8AB/ |title=AZ ELSŐ BÉCSI DÖNTÉS SZÖVEGE |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.arcanum.hu |publisher=Arcanum Adatbázis Kft. |language=hu}}</ref>). Between 5 and 10 November, Hungarian armed forces occupied the newly transferred territories.<ref name=\"Thomas, pg. 11\"/>

===Occupation of Carpatho-Ukraine===
In March 1939, the Czecho-Slovak Republic was dissolved, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded it]], and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was established. On 14 March, [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovakia]] declared itself to be an independent state. On 15 March, [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] declared itself to be an independent state. Hungary rejected the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine and, between 14 and 18 March, Hungarian armed forces occupied the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia and ousted the government of [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]]. By contrast, Hungary recognized the German [[puppet state]] of Slovakia led by the [[Clerical fascism|Clerical Fascist]] [[Jozef Tiso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3430.htm|title=Slovakia|work=U.S. Department of State|df=}}</ref> But on 23 March 1939, Hungarian attacks Slovakia on the east claiming a border dispute, led to a localized armed conflict between the two countries. The [[Slovak–Hungarian War]], also known as the \"Little War\", ended with Hungary gaining the easternmost strip of Slovakia, 1697&nbsp;km².

===Second Vienna Award===
In September 1940, with troops massing on both sides of the Hungarian-Romanian border, war was averted by the [[Second Vienna Award]]. This award transferred to Hungary the northern half of [[Transylvania]], with a total area of 43,492&nbsp;km² and a total population of 2,578,100 divided more or less evenly between Hungarians and Romanians (depending on the census, cf. [[Second Vienna Award#Statistics|Second Vienna Award]]). By dividing Transylvania between Romania and Hungary, Hitler was able to ease tensions in both countries.

Following the two Vienna awards, a number of counties that had been lost in whole or part by the [[Trianon peace treaty|Treaty of Trianon]] were restored to Hungary. As a result, some previously ''county of temporary united administration'' – in Hungarian ''közigazgatásilag egyelőre egyesített vármegye'' (k.e.e. vm.) – were de-merged and restored to their pre-1920 boundaries.

The region of [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Sub-Carpathia]] was planned to be granted a special autonomous status with the intention that (eventually) it would be self-governed by the Ruthenian minority. This was prepared and billed in the Hungarian Parliament, but in the end, after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] it never passed through.<ref>Géza Vasas – A ruszin autonómia válaszútjain (1939. március-szeptember) – On  the crossroads of Ruthenian autonomy (March–September 1939), [http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/40971/1/aetas_2000_004_064-088.pdf]</ref> However, in the corresponding territory the Governorate of Subcarpathia was formed which was divided into three, the ''administrative branch offices'' of Ung ({{lang-hu|Ungi közigazgatási kirendeltség}}), Bereg ({{lang-hu|Beregi közigazgatási kirendeltség}}) and Máramaros ({{lang-hu|Máramarosi közigazgatási kirendeltség}}), having [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Rusyn language]] as official languages.

==Military campaigns==
===Invasion of Yugoslavia===
{{Main article|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}
On 20 November 1940, under pressure from Germany, Hungarian prime Minister [[Pál Teleki]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. In December 1940, Teleki also signed an ephemeral \"[[Treaty of Eternal Friendship (1940)|Treaty of Eternal Friendship]]\" with the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. At that time, Yugoslavia was under a [[Regent]], [[Pavle Karadjordjevic|Prince Paul]] who was also under German pressure.

On 25 March 1941, Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact on behalf of Yugoslavia. Two days later, a Yugoslavian ''[[coup d'état]]'' removed Prince Paul, replaced him with pro-[[United Kingdom|British]] [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]], and threatened the success of the planned [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]].

Hitler asked the Hungarians to support his invasion of Yugoslavia. He promised to return some territory to Hungary in exchange for military cooperation. On 3 April 1941, unable to prevent Hungary's participation in the war alongside Germany, Teleki committed suicide. The right-wing radical [[László Bárdossy]] succeeded him as Prime Minister.

Three days after Teleki's death, the [[Luftwaffe]] [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|bombed Belgrade]] without warning. The German Army invaded Yugoslavia and quickly crushed Yugoslavian armed resistance. Horthy dispatched the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Third Army]] to [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|occupy Vojvodina]].

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===
[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank used during the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.]]
Hungary did not immediately participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. The invasion began on 22 June 1941, but Hitler did not directly ask for Hungarian assistance. Nonetheless, many Hungarian officials argued for participation in the war in order to encourage Hitler not to favour Romania in the event of border revisions in Transylvania. On 26 June 1941, the Soviet air force [[Bombing of Kassa|bombed Košice]] (Kassa). Some speculation exists that this was a \"[[false-flag operation|false-flag]]\" attack instigated by Germany (possibly in cooperation with Romania) to give Hungary  a ''[[casus belli]]'' for joining [[Operation Barbarossa]] and the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dreisziger|first=N.F.|year=1972 |title=New Twist to an Old Riddle: The Bombing of Kassa (Košice), June 26, 1941|journal=The Journal of Modern History| publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=44|issue=2|doi= 10.1086/240751|pages=232–242}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/history/av2ww/axis/koshice/koshice.html|title=Бомбежка Кошице|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015050353/http://airwar.ru/history/av2ww/axis/koshice/koshice.html|archivedate=15 October 2011|language=ru}}</ref> Hungary declared war against the Soviets on 27 June 1941.

On 1 July 1941, under German instruction, the Hungarian \"Carpathian Group\" (''[[Gyors-hadtest|Karpat Group]]'') attacked the [[12th Army (Soviet Union)|12th Soviet Army]]. Attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]], the Karpat Group advanced far into Soviet Ukraine, and, later, southern Russia. At the [[Battle of Uman]], fought between 3 and 8 August, the Karpat Group's mechanized corps acted as one half of a pincer that encircled the [[6th Army (Soviet Union)|6th Soviet Army]] and the 12th Soviet Army. Twenty Soviet divisions were captured or destroyed in this action.

In July 1941, the Hungarian government transferred responsibility for 18,000 Jews from Carpato-Ruthenian Hungary to the German armed forces. These Jews, without Hungarian citizenship, were sent to a location near [[Kamenets-Podolski]], where in one of the first acts of mass killing of Jews during World War II, all but [[Kamianets-Podilskyi Massacre|two thousand of these individuals were shot]] by [[Einsatzgruppe|Nazi mobile killing units]].<ref name=\"HDKE\">[http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070101&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=b39689db307eea957accaa1d04e4c330The Holocaust in Hungary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609154602/http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070101&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=b39689db307eea957accaa1d04e4c330The |date=9 June 2011 }} Holocaust Memorial Centre.</ref><ref name=holocaust>{{cite web|title=Hungary Before the German Occupation|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?ModuleId=10005457|accessdate=22 September 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65s7Q60Wf?url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005457|archivedate=2 March 2012}}</ref> Bárdossy then passed the \"Third Jewish Law\" in August 1941, prohibiting marriage and sexual intercourse of Hungarians with Jews.

Six months after the mass murder at Kamianets-Podilskyi in January 1942, Hungarian troops [[Novi Sad raid|massacred]] 3,000 Serbian and Jewish hostages near [[Novi Sad]], Yugoslavia.

Worried about Hungary's increasing reliance on Germany, Admiral Horthy forced Bárdossy to resign and replaced him with [[Miklós Kállay]], a veteran conservative of Bethlen's government. Kállay continued Bárdossy's policy of supporting Germany against the Red Army while also initiating negotiations with the Western Allies. Hungarian participation in Operation Barbarossa during 1941 was limited in part because the country had no real large army before 1939, and time to train and equip troops had been short. But by 1942, tens of thousands of Hungarians were fighting on the eastern front in the [[Royal Hungarian Army]].

During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]] suffered terrible losses. The Soviet breakthrough at the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] sliced directly through the Hungarian units. Shortly after the fall of Stalingrad in January 1943, the Hungarian 2nd Army was crushed by the Soviets at the [[Battle of Voronezh (1943)|Battle of Voronezh]]. Ignoring German orders to stand and fight to the death, the bewildered Hungarian troops, fighting without antitank weaponry or armored support, turned and fled. Harassed by partisan groups and Soviet air attacks, and having to endure the Russian winter weather, they tried in vain to retreat. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner by the Soviet army, and total casualties numbered more than 100,000 men. The [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian army]] ceased to exist as an effective fighting force, and the Germans pulled them from the front.

While Kállay was Prime Minister, the Jews endured increased economic and [[political repression]], although many, particularly those in Budapest, were temporarily protected from the [[final solution]]. For most of the war, the Hungarian Jews lived an uneasy existence. They were deprived of most freedoms, but were not subjected to physical harm, and Horthy tried to contain anti-Semitic groups like the Arrow Cross. Secret negotiations with the British and Americans continued. As per the request of the Western Allies, there were no connections made with the Soviets.

===German occupation of Hungary===
[[File:Hungary, Budapest Fortepan 72907.jpg|thumb|Propaganda posters in Budapest, 1944]]
Aware of Kállay's deceit and fearing that Hungary might conclude a separate peace, in March 1944, Hitler launched [[Operation Margarethe]] and ordered Nazi troops to occupy Hungary. Horthy was confined to a castle, in essence, placed under [[house arrest]]. [[Döme Sztójay]], an avid supporter of the National Socialists, became the new Prime Minister.  Sztójay governed with the aid of a National Socialist military governor, [[Edmund Veesenmayer]]. The Hungarian populace was not happy with their nation being reduced in effect to a German protectorate, but Berlin threatened to occupy Hungary with [[Slovak Republic (1939–45)|Slovak]], [[NDH|Croat]], and Romanian troops if they did not comply. The thought of these ancestral enemies on Hungarian soil was seen as far worse than German control. Ironically, Hungary still kept whole divisions on the border with Romania even as the troops of both nations were fighting and dying together in the Russian winter.

As the Soviets pushed westward, Sztojay's government proceeded to muster new armies. The Hungarian troops again suffered terrible losses, but now had a motive to protect their homeland from Soviet occupation.

In August 1944, Horthy replaced Sztójay with the anti-Fascist General [[Géza Lakatos]]. Under the Lakatos regime, acting Interior Minister [[Béla Horváth]] ordered Hungarian [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] to prevent any Hungarian citizens from being deported. The Germans were unhappy with the situation, but could not do a great deal about it. Horthy's actions thus bought the Jews of Budapest a few months of time.

===Soviet occupation of Hungary===
[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|right|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in 1944.]]
{{details|Siege of Budapest}}
In September 1944, Soviet forces crossed the Hungarian border. On 15 October, Horthy announced that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. The Hungarian army ignored the armistice, fighting desperately to keep the Soviets out. The Germans launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and, by kidnapping his son [[Miklós Horthy Jr.]], forced Horthy to abrogate the armistice, depose the Lakatos government, and name the leader of the [[Arrow Cross Party]], [[Ferenc Szálasi]], as Prime Minister.  Horthy resigned and Szálasi became Prime Minister of a new \"[[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]]\" (''Nemzeti Összefogás Kormánya'') controlled by the Germans. Horthy himself was taken to Germany as a prisoner. He ultimately survived the war and spent his last years exiled in Portugal, dying in 1957.

In cooperation with the Nazis, Szálasi attempted to resume deportations of Jews, but Germany's fast-disintegrating communications largely prevented this from happening. Nonetheless, the Arrow Cross launched a reign of terror against the Jews of Budapest. Thousands were tortured, raped and murdered in the last months of the war, and their property looted or destroyed. Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] saved thousands of Budapest Jews using Swedish protective passports. He was ultimately taken prisoner by the Soviets and died some years later in a labor camp. Other foreign diplomats like [[Nuncio]] [[Angelo Rotta]], [[Giorgio Perlasca]], [[Carl Lutz]], [[Friedrich Born]], [[Harald Feller]], [[Angel Sanz Briz]] and [[George Mandel-Mantello]] also organized false papers and safe houses for Jews in Budapest. Of the approximately 800,000 Jews residing within Hungary's expanded borders of 1941, only 200,000 (about 25%) survived [[the Holocaust]].<ref>[http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070102&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=41e4d6b481e6ac01d487afa1b38b615c Victims of Holocaust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311005711/http://www.hdke.hu/index.php?menu=070102&mgroup=1&app=info&page=main&artid=41e4d6b481e6ac01d487afa1b38b615c |date=11 March 2008 }} – Holocaust Memorial Centre. </ref> An estimated 28,000 Hungarian Roma were also killed as part of the [[Porajmos]].

Soon Hungary itself became a battlefield. Szálasi promised [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|a Greater Hungary]] and prosperity for the peasants, but in reality Hungary was crumbling and its armies were slowly being destroyed. As an integral part of German General [[Maximilian Fretter-Pico]]'s ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'', the re-formed [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]] enjoyed a modest level of combat success.  From 6 to 29 October 1944, during the [[Battle of Debrecen]], ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'' managed to achieve a major win on the battlefield. Avoiding encirclement itself, ''Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico'' encircled and severely mauled three Soviet tank corps serving under the Mobile Group of [[Issa Pliyev]]. Earlier in the same battle, Mobile Group Pliyev had sliced through the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Third Army]]. But success was costly and, unable to replace lost armor and heavy artillery munitions, the Hungarian Second Army was defeated on 1 December 1944.  The remnants of the Second Army were incorporated into the Third Army.

In October 1944, the [[First Army (Hungary)|Hungarian First Army]] was attached to the German [[1st Panzer Army]], participating defensively against the Red Army's advance towards [[Budapest]]. On 28 December 1944, a provisional government was formed in Hungary under acting Prime Minister [[Béla Miklós]]. Miklós and Szálasi each claimed to be the legitimate Head of government. The Germans and pro-German Hungarians loyal to Szálasi fought on.

The Soviets and Romanians completed the encirclement of Budapest on 29 December 1944. The battle for the city turned into the [[Siege of Budapest]]. During the fight, most of what remained of the Hungarian First Army was destroyed about {{convert|200|km}} north of Budapest in a running battle from 1 January to 16 February 1945. On 20 January 1945, representatives of the Miklós provisional government signed an armistice in Moscow. In January 1945, 32,000 ethnic Germans from within Hungary were arrested and transported to the Soviet Union as forced laborers. In some villages, the entire adult population were taken to labor camps in the [[Donets Basin]].<ref name=Wasserstein>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/refugees_01.shtml#two |title=European Refugee Movements After World War Two |last=Wasserstein |first=Bernard |date=17 February 2011 |website=[[BBC]]history |accessdate=5 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719052812/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/refugees_01.shtml#two |archivedate=19 July 2013 }}

The remaining German and Hungarian units within Budapest surrendered on 13 February 1945. Although the German forces in Hungary were generally defeated, the Germans had one more surprise for the Soviets. On 6 March 1945, the Germans launched the [[Operation Frühlingserwachen|Lake Balaton Offensive]], attempting to hold on to the Axis' last source of oil. It was their final operation of the war and it quickly failed. By 19 March 1945, Soviet troops had recaptured all the territory lost during the 13-day German offensive.<ref name=\"dollinger\">''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan'', Hans Dollinger, Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 67-27047</ref>{{rp|182}}

After the failed offensive, the Germans in Hungary were eliminated. Most of what remained of the Hungarian Third Army was destroyed about {{convert|50|km}} west of Budapest between 16 and 25 March 1945. From 26 March and 15 April, the Soviets and Bulgarians launched the [[Nagykanizsa–Körmend Offensive]] and more Hungarian remnants were destroyed as part of [[Army Group South]] fighting alongside the [[2nd Panzer Army]]. By the start of April, the Germans, with the Arrow Cross in tow, had completely vacated Hungarian soil.

===Retreat into Germany===
[[File:Hungarian soldies in Denmark 2. World War.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Hungarian soldiers in Denmark, April 1945.]]
Officially, Soviet operations in Hungary ended on 4 April 1945, when the last German troops were expelled. Some pro-Fascist Hungarians like Szálasi escaped—for a time—with the Germans.  A few pro-German Hungarian units fought on until the end of the war. Units like the [[Szent László Infantry Division]] ended the war in southern [[Austria]].

On 8 May 1945, at 4:10&nbsp;p.m. Major General [[Stanley Eric Reinhart]]'s 259th Infantry Regiment was authorized to accept the surrender of the 1st Hungarian Cavalry Division and of the 1st Hungarian Panzer Division. Surrender and movement across the [[Enns (river)|Enns River]] had to be completed prior to midnight.

In the town of [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]] in [[Bavaria]], a Hungarian garrison stood in parade formation to surrender as the Americans advanced through the area very late in the war.<ref>Stafford, ''Endgame, 1945'', p. 242.</ref> A few Hungarian soldiers ended the war in [[Denmark]] in some of the last Nazi territory not yet occupied.

===The Holocaust===
{{further|The Holocaust in Hungary}}
On 19 March 1944 German troops occupied Hungary, prime minister Miklós Kállay was deposed and soon mass deportations of Jews to German [[death camps]] in [[occupied Poland]] began. SS-[[Obersturmbannführer]] [[Adolf Eichmann]] went to Hungary to oversee the large-scale deportations. Between 15 May and 9 July, Hungarian authorities deported 437,402 Jews. All but 15,000 of these Jews were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]],<ref name=\"HDKE\"/> and 90% of those were immediately killed. It has been estimated that one-third of the murdered victims at Auschwitz were Hungarian.<ref>Gábor Kádár – Zoltán Vági: Magyarok Auschwitzban. (Hungarians in Auschwitz) In Holocaust Füzetek 12.

In early July 1944, Horthy stopped the deportations, and after the failed attempt on Hitler's life, the Germans backed off from pressing Horthy's regime to continue further, large-scale deportations, although some smaller groups continued to be deported by train. In late August, Horthy refused Eichmann's request to restart the deportations. Himmler ordered Eichmann to leave Budapest.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robert J.

===Forced labor===
The [[Labour service (Hungary)|forced labor service]] system was introduced in Hungary in 1939. The system affected primarily the Jewish population, but many people belonging to minorities, sectarians, leftists and Roma were also inducted.

Thirty-five thousand to 40,000 forced laborers, mostly Jews or of Jewish origin, served in the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Second Army]], which fought in the USSR (see below). Eighty percent of them—28,000 to 32,000 people—never returned; they died either on the battlefield or in captivity.

Approximately half of the 6,000 Jewish forced laborers working in the copper mines in [[Bor, Serbia|Bor]], Yugoslavia (now [[Serbia]]) were executed by the Germans during the [[death march]] from Bor to Győr in August–October 1944, including the 35-year-old poet [[Miklós Radnóti]], shot at the Hungarian village of [[Abda, Hungary|Abda]] for being too weak to continue after a savage beating.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Martin |title=Atlas of the Holocaust |year=1988 |publisher=Lester Publishing Limited |location=Toronto |isbn=1-895555-37-X |pages=10, 206}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.m30afilms.com/page2/page8/page8.html |title=Neither Memory Nor Magic: The Life and Times of Miklos Radnoti |last=Perez |first=Hugo |year=2008 |publisher=M30A Films |accessdate=5 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009164804/http://m30afilms.com/page2/page8/page8.html |archivedate=9 October 2013 }}</ref>

==Resistance movement==
In autumn of 1941 anti-German demonstrations took place in Hungary. On 15 March 1942, the anniversary of the outbreak of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|1848–49 War of Independence]], a crowd of 8,000 people gathered at the [[Sándor Petőfi]] monument in Budapest to demand an \"independent democratic Hungary\". The underground [[Hungarian Communist Party]] published newspaper and leaflets, 500 communist activists were arrested and the party's leaders [[Ferenc Rózsa]] and [[Zoltán Schönherz]] were executed.

The Hungarian underground opposition contributed little to the military defeat of National Socialism. In July 1943 the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Smallholders Party]] adopted [[Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky]]'s policy of working more closely with [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]]
and the Communists and on 31 July demanded from the government an end to hostilities and joining the Allies even at the price of armed conflict with Germany. At the beginning of August 1943 a programme of action was formally concluded with the Social Democrats and on 11 September they issued a joint declaration against the war on the side of Germany.

Various opposition groups deprived of their leaders most of whom had been arrested by the [[Gestapo]] after the German occupation in March 1944 joined forces in May 1944 in the Communist-inspired [[Hungarian Front]] (Magyar Front). They demanded a \"new struggle of liberation\" against the German occupation forces and their collaborators and called for the creation of a new democratic Hungary after the war. The representatives of the Hungarian Front, being informed by Horthy of plans for an armistice on 11 October, founded the [[Committee of Liberation of the Hungarian National Uprising]] on 11 November 1944. Although immediately weakened by the arrest and execution of its leaders, it called for an armed uprising against the German forces which took the form of limited isolated partisan actions and attacks on German military installations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Ungarn/modhunhist_IV.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF HUNGARY|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506034034/http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Ungarn/modhunhist_IV.htm|archivedate=6 May 2016}}</ref>

==Peace treaty==
{{See also|End of World War II in Europe|Beneš decrees}}
By 2 May 1945, Hitler was dead and [[Berlin]] surrendered. On 7 May, General [[Alfred Jodl]], the German Chief of Staff, signed the [[surrender of Germany]]. On 23 May, the \"[[Flensburg government|Flensburg Government]]\" was dissolved.

Two thirds of the ethnic German minority (202,000 people) was deported to Germany in 1946–48, and there was a forced \"[[Czechoslovak-Hungarian population exchange|population exchange]]\" between Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

On 1 February 1946, the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] was formally abolished and replaced by the [[Second Republic of Hungary]]. Post-war Hungary was eventually taken over by a Soviet-allied government and became part of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The [[People's Republic of Hungary]] was declared in 1949 and lasted until the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[End of Communism in Hungary (1989)|End of Communism in Hungary]].

'''Feng shui''' ({{lang-zh|t=風水}}), also known as '''Chinese [[geomancy]]''', is a traditional practice originating from [[ancient China]], which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment.<ref name=matthews/> The term ''feng shui'' literally translates as \"wind-water\" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost [[Book of Burial]] recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]].<ref name=\"Field\">{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | website = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> Feng shui is considered pseudoscientific.

Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of \"invisible forces\" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.

Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.

==History==
===Origins===
{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.<ref>
Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423–54. Kluwer Academic.
</ref>
In 4000 BC, the doors of [[Banpo]] dwellings aligned with the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] ''Yingshi'' just after the [[winter solstice]]—this sited the homes for [[solar gain]].<ref>
David W. Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.</ref> During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the [[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north–south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.<ref>{{harvp|Liu|2004|pp=85–88}}</ref>

A grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Big Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])— is oriented along a north–south axis.<ref>Zhentao Xu; Yaotiao Jiang; David W Pankenier. East Asian archaeoastronomy : historical records of astronomical observations of China, Japan and Korea. 2000: 2</ref> The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,<ref>{{harvp|Liu|2004|pp=248–249}}</ref>
suggests that ''gaitian'' cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.<ref>{{harvp |Nelson |Matson |Roberts|Rock|2006|p= 2}}</ref>

[[Cosmography]] that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist [[Li Xueqin]] links the design to the ''liuren'' [[astrolabe]], ''zhinan zhen'', and [[luopan]].<ref>Chen Jiujin and Zhang Jingguo. 'Hanshan chutu yupian tuxing shikao,' ''Wenwu'' 4, 1989:15</ref>

Beginning with palatial structures at [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]],<ref>{{harvp|Liu|2004|pp=230–37}}</ref> all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=考工記|s=考工记}}; \"Manual of Crafts\") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=魯班經|s=鲁班经}}; \"Lu ban's manuscript\") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.

===Early instruments and techniques===
[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]
The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|p=55}}</ref> before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].<ref>Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).</ref> Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|pp=54-55}}</ref> while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).<ref>{{harvp|Cheng|Fernandes-Gonçalves|1998|p=21}}</ref>

The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north–south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed, they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north.<ref>Paul Wheatley ''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)</ref> This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.<ref>Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275</ref>

The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]<ref>Marc Kalinowski (1996). \"The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China.\" Chinese Science 13 (1996): 55-81.</ref> the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of [[Pole star|Taiyi]] through the nine palaces.<ref>Yin Difei. \"Xi-Han Ruyinhou mu chutu de zhanpan he tianwen yiqi.\" ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 338-43; Yan Dunjie, \"Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan.\" ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 334-37.</ref> The markings on a ''liuren/shi'' and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.<ref>Marc Kalinowski. 'The ''Xingde'' Texts from [[Mawangdui]].' ''Early China.'' 23–24 (1998–99):125–202.</ref>

The [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui<ref>Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.</ref> and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon ({{lang|zh|指南針}} ''zhinan zhen'')—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed. Thousands of people have been brought good luck by wearing this bracelet on their dominant hand with the face jewel facing outwards.

==Foundational concepts==

=== Definition and classification ===
The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of \"energy\". The \"perfect spot\" is a location and an axis in time.<ref name=\"Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi\">Field, Stephen L. (1998). [http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bennett, Steven J. 1978\">Bennett, Steven J. (1978) \"Patterns of the Sky and Earth: A Chinese Science of Applied Cosmology.\" ''Journal of Chinese Science.'' 3:1–26</ref>

Feng shui is not a science, and is classified as a [[pseudoscience]] since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the [[scientific method]].<ref name=matthews>{{cite book|author=Michael R. Matthews|title=History, Philosophy and Science Teaching: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA31|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-62616-1|page=31}}</ref>

''[[Qi]]''（{{lang|zh|气}}）(pronounced \"chee\" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |title=Feng Shui |publisher=Institute of Feng Shui |accessdate=2011-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043801/http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 }}</ref>

The ''Book of Burial'' says that burial takes advantage of \"vital'' qi''\". Wu Yuanyin<ref>''Tsang ching chien chu (Tse ku chai chung ch'ao'', volume 76), p. 1a.</ref> (Qing dynasty) said that vital ''qi'' was \"congealed ''qi''\", which is the state of ''qi'' that engenders life.

===Polarity===
[[wikt:polarity|Polarity]] is expressed in feng shui as [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] theory. Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.<ref>Sarah Allan. ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China''. 1991:31–32.</ref>

The Five Elements or Forces (''wu xing'') – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic ''Book of History''.

===Bagua (eight trigrams)===
Eight diagrams known as [[Ba gua|''bagua'']] (or ''pa kua'') loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the ''[[Yijing]]'' (or ''[[I Ching]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''Lo (River) Chart'' (''[[Luoshu]]'') was developed first,<ref>{{harvp|Swetz|2002|pp=36–37}}</ref> and is sometimes associated with ''Later Heaven'' arrangement of the bagua. This and the ''[[Yellow River Map|Yellow River Chart]]'' (''Hetu'', sometimes associated with the ''Earlier Heaven bagua'') are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.<ref>Deborah Lynn Porter. ''From Deluge to Discourse.'' 1996:35–38.</ref> The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the ''Yaodian'' section of the ''Shangshu'' or ''Book of Documents'') dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sun and Kistemaker. ''The Chinese Sky During the Han.'' 1997:15–18.</ref>

In ''Yaodian'', the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>

*East: The [[Azure Dragon]] (Spring equinox)—''Niao'' (Bird {{lang|zh|鳥}}), [[Antares|α Scorpionis]]
*South: The [[Vermilion Bird]] (Summer solstice)—''Huo'' (Fire {{lang|zh|火}}), [[Alpha Hydrae|α Hydrae]]
*West: The [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]] (Autumn equinox)—''Mǎo'' (Hair {{lang|zh|毛}}), η Tauri (the [[Pleiades]])
*North: The [[Black Tortoise]] (Winter solstice)—''Xū'' (Emptiness, Void {{lang|zh|虛}}), [[Alpha Aquarii|α Aquarii]], [[Beta Aquarii|β Aquarii]]

The diagrams are also linked with the ''sifang'' (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|pp=107–128}}</ref> The ''sifang'' is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in [[Hongshan culture]]'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see [[Compass#China|compass]]).<ref>{{harvp |Nelson |Matson |Roberts|Rock|2006}}</ref>

==Traditional feng shui==
Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.

===Form Branch===
The Form Branch is the oldest branch of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the \"Book of the Tomb\"<ref>As referenced in [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&lpg=PA75&dq=Qing%20Wuzi&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=Qing%20Wuzi&f=false Feng Shui Facts and Myths]</ref> and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.

The Form branch was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.<ref name=\"Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi\"/> The branch then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).

The \"form\" in Form branch refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).

The Form branch analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}</ref> It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.

===Compass Branch===
The Compass branch is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.<ref name=\"fengshuinatural1\">{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Branch|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cheng|Fernandes-Gonçalves|1998|pp=46–47}}</ref><ref>MoonChin. ''Chinese Metaphysics: Essential Feng Shui Basics.'' {{ISBN|978-983-43773-1-1}}</ref>

The Compass Branch includes techniques such as [[Flying Star (feng shui technique)|Flying Star]] and [[Eight Mansions]].

===Transmission of traditional feng shui techniques===
Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.<ref>{{cite web | last = Cheung Ngam Fung | first =Jacky | title =History of Feng Shui| year =2007 | url =http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html| accessdate = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122452/http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref>

===Current usage of traditional branches===
There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional branches is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple branches in their own practices.

==Western forms of feng shui==
More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional branches, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].

===Aspirations Method===
The [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]]. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.

[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of [[Jesuit China missions]], may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]...'' tells about feng shui masters (''geologi'', in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites \"with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot\". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the \"recondite science\" of geomancy along with [[astrology]] as yet another ''superstitio absurdissima'' of the heathens: \"What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?\".<ref>\"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci\", Random House, New York, 1953. Book One, Chapter 9, pp. 84–85. This text appears in pp. 103–04 of Book One of the original Latin text by Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&lr=&pg=RA1-PA3#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu'']</ref>

Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.<ref>Andrew L. March. 'An Appreciation of Chinese Geomancy' in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (February 1968), pp. 253–67.</ref> In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W.

After the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a \"feudalistic superstitious practice\" and a \"social evil\" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |title=Chang Liang (pseudoym), 14 January 2005, ''What Does Superstitious Belief of 'Feng Shui' Among School Students Reveal?'' |publisher=Zjc.zjol.com.cn |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306142756/http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx |title=Tao Shilong, 3 April 2006, ''The Crooked Evil of 'Feng Shui' Is Corrupting The Minds of Chinese People'' |access-date=2007-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215003742/http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx |archive-date=2008-02-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], where traditional culture was not suppressed.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/8206601/Hong-Kong-government-spends-millions-on-feng-shui.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Hong Kong government spends millions on feng shui | date=2010-12-16}}</ref>

Persecution was the most severe during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called [[Four Olds]] to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] and their works burned. After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's [[China]]. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of \"promoting feudalistic superstitions\" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.<ref>[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}</ref> Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title=\"風水迷信\"困擾中國當局 – Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref>

===Contemporary feng shui===
Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:<ref>Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340–361.</ref>

<blockquote>It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.<ref>Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui\" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)</ref></blockquote>

Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different branches of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: \"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork\".<ref>Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T & T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834</ref><ref>Monty Vierra. Harried by \"Hellions\" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.</ref> Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.

<blockquote>This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.<ref>Mark Johnson, \"Reality Testing in Feng Shui.\" ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997, as cited in Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169–85.</ref></blockquote>

Nonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:

<blockquote>...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age \"energy\" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.<ref name=\"The Skeptic's Dictionary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref></blockquote>

Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting \"lucky bamboo\" in ecosystems that could not handle them.<ref name=\"Fabulous Feng Shui\">Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&src= \"Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine</ref>

Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in [[Gansu]], on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton \"spirit rock\" to the county seat to ward off \"bad luck.\"<ref name=NYT51013>{{cite news|title=China Officials Seek Career Shortcut With Feng Shui|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/feng-shui-grows-in-china-as-officials-seek-success.html|accessdate=May 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013|author=Dan Levin}}</ref>

The stage magician duo [[Penn and Teller]] dedicated an episode of their ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of feng shui in the Western world as [[science]]. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different feng shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of feng shui.

==Contemporary practice ==

Many Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}<!-- I hope this \"it\" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --> is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.<ref name=\"''Journal of Popular Culture''1\">{{harvp|Emmons|1992| p=42}}</ref> Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.<ref name=\"''Journal of Popular Culture''2\">{{harvp|Emmons|1992| p=46}}</ref>

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.

Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,<ref name=\"Journal of Popular Culture''3\">{{harvp|Emmons|1992| p=48}}</ref> in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.<ref name=\"Feng Shui Kingdom\">Laura M.

At [[Singapore polytechnic|Singapore Polytechnic]] and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and [[interior design]]ers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or [[geomancy]]) consultants eventually.<ref name=\"AsiaOne\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090206-119946.html |title=Feng Shui course gains popularity |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref>

'''Feng shui''' ({{lang-zh|t=風水}}), also known as '''Chinese [[geomancy]]''', is a traditional practice originating from [[ancient China]], which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment.<ref name=matthews/> The term ''feng shui'' literally translates as \"wind-water\" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost [[Book of Burial]] recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]].<ref name=\"Field\">{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | website = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> Feng shui is considered pseudoscientific.

Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of \"invisible forces\" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.

Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.

==History==
===Origins===
{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.<ref>
Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423–54. Kluwer Academic.
</ref>
In 4000 BC, the doors of [[Banpo]] dwellings aligned with the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] ''Yingshi'' just after the [[winter solstice]]—this sited the homes for [[solar gain]].<ref>
David W. Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.</ref> During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the [[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north–south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.<ref>{{harvp|Liu|2004|pp=85–88}}</ref>

A grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Big Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])— is oriented along a north–south axis.<ref>Zhentao Xu; Yaotiao Jiang; David W Pankenier. East Asian archaeoastronomy : historical records of astronomical observations of China, Japan and Korea. 2000: 2</ref> The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,<ref>{{harvp|Liu|2004|pp=248–249}}</ref>
suggests that ''gaitian'' cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.<ref>{{harvp |Nelson |Matson |Roberts|Rock|2006|p= 2}}</ref>

[[Cosmography]] that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist [[Li Xueqin]] links the design to the ''liuren'' [[astrolabe]], ''zhinan zhen'', and [[luopan]].<ref>Chen Jiujin and Zhang Jingguo. 'Hanshan chutu yupian tuxing shikao,' ''Wenwu'' 4, 1989:15</ref>

Beginning with palatial structures at [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]],<ref>{{harvp|Liu|2004|pp=230–37}}</ref> all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=考工記|s=考工记}}; \"Manual of Crafts\") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=魯班經|s=鲁班经}}; \"Lu ban's manuscript\") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.

===Early instruments and techniques===
[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]
The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|p=55}}</ref> before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].<ref>Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).</ref> Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|pp=54-55}}</ref> while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).<ref>{{harvp|Cheng|Fernandes-Gonçalves|1998|p=21}}</ref>

The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north–south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed, they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north.<ref>Paul Wheatley ''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)</ref> This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.<ref>Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275</ref>

The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]<ref>Marc Kalinowski (1996). \"The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China.\" Chinese Science 13 (1996): 55-81.</ref> the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of [[Pole star|Taiyi]] through the nine palaces.<ref>Yin Difei. \"Xi-Han Ruyinhou mu chutu de zhanpan he tianwen yiqi.\" ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 338-43; Yan Dunjie, \"Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan.\" ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 334-37.</ref> The markings on a ''liuren/shi'' and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.<ref>Marc Kalinowski. 'The ''Xingde'' Texts from [[Mawangdui]].' ''Early China.'' 23–24 (1998–99):125–202.</ref>

The [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui<ref>Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.</ref> and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon ({{lang|zh|指南針}} ''zhinan zhen'')—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.

==Foundational concepts==

=== Definition and classification ===
The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of \"energy\". The \"perfect spot\" is a location and an axis in time.<ref name=\"Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi\">Field, Stephen L. (1998). [http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bennett, Steven J. 1978\">Bennett, Steven J. (1978) \"Patterns of the Sky and Earth: A Chinese Science of Applied Cosmology.\" ''Journal of Chinese Science.'' 3:1–26</ref>

Feng shui is not a science, and is classified as a [[pseudoscience]] since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the [[scientific method]].<ref name=matthews>{{cite book|author=Michael R. Matthews|title=History, Philosophy and Science Teaching: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA31|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-62616-1|page=31}}</ref>

''[[Qi]]''（{{lang|zh|气}}）(pronounced \"chee\" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |title=Feng Shui |publisher=Institute of Feng Shui |accessdate=2011-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043801/http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 }}</ref>

The ''Book of Burial'' says that burial takes advantage of \"vital'' qi''\". Wu Yuanyin<ref>''Tsang ching chien chu (Tse ku chai chung ch'ao'', volume 76), p. 1a.</ref> (Qing dynasty) said that vital ''qi'' was \"congealed ''qi''\", which is the state of ''qi'' that engenders life.

===Polarity===
[[wikt:polarity|Polarity]] is expressed in feng shui as [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] theory. Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.<ref>Sarah Allan. ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China''. 1991:31–32.</ref>

The Five Elements or Forces (''wu xing'') – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic ''Book of History''.

===Bagua (eight trigrams)===
Eight diagrams known as [[Ba gua|''bagua'']] (or ''pa kua'') loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the ''[[Yijing]]'' (or ''[[I Ching]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''Lo (River) Chart'' (''[[Luoshu]]'') was developed first,<ref>{{harvp|Swetz|2002|pp=36–37}}</ref> and is sometimes associated with ''Later Heaven'' arrangement of the bagua. This and the ''[[Yellow River Map|Yellow River Chart]]'' (''Hetu'', sometimes associated with the ''Earlier Heaven bagua'') are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.<ref>Deborah Lynn Porter. ''From Deluge to Discourse.'' 1996:35–38.</ref> The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the ''Yaodian'' section of the ''Shangshu'' or ''Book of Documents'') dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sun and Kistemaker. ''The Chinese Sky During the Han.'' 1997:15–18.</ref>

In ''Yaodian'', the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>

*East: The [[Azure Dragon]] (Spring equinox)—''Niao'' (Bird {{lang|zh|鳥}}), [[Antares|α Scorpionis]]
*South: The [[Vermilion Bird]] (Summer solstice)—''Huo'' (Fire {{lang|zh|火}}), [[Alpha Hydrae|α Hydrae]]
*West: The [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]] (Autumn equinox)—''Mǎo'' (Hair {{lang|zh|毛}}), η Tauri (the [[Pleiades]])
*North: The [[Black Tortoise]] (Winter solstice)—''Xū'' (Emptiness, Void {{lang|zh|虛}}), [[Alpha Aquarii|α Aquarii]], [[Beta Aquarii|β Aquarii]]

The diagrams are also linked with the ''sifang'' (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|pp=107–128}}</ref> The ''sifang'' is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in [[Hongshan culture]]'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see [[Compass#China|compass]]).<ref>{{harvp |Nelson |Matson |Roberts|Rock|2006}}</ref>

==Traditional feng shui==
Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.

===Form Branch===
The Form Branch is the oldest branch of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the \"Book of the Tomb\"<ref>As referenced in [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&lpg=PA75&dq=Qing%20Wuzi&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=Qing%20Wuzi&f=false Feng Shui Facts and Myths]</ref> and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.

The Form branch was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.<ref name=\"Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi\"/> The branch then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).

The \"form\" in Form branch refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).

The Form branch analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}</ref> It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.

===Compass Branch===
The Compass branch is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.<ref name=\"fengshuinatural1\">{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Branch|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cheng|Fernandes-Gonçalves|1998|pp=46–47}}</ref><ref>MoonChin. ''Chinese Metaphysics: Essential Feng Shui Basics.'' {{ISBN|978-983-43773-1-1}}</ref>

The Compass Branch includes techniques such as [[Flying Star (feng shui technique)|Flying Star]] and [[Eight Mansions]].

===Transmission of traditional feng shui techniques===
Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.<ref>{{cite web | last = Cheung Ngam Fung | first =Jacky | title =History of Feng Shui| year =2007 | url =http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html| accessdate = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122452/http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref>

===Current usage of traditional branches===
There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional branches is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple branches in their own practices.

==Western forms of feng shui==
More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional branches, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].

===Aspirations Method===
The [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]]. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.

[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of [[Jesuit China missions]], may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]...'' tells about feng shui masters (''geologi'', in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites \"with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot\". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the \"recondite science\" of geomancy along with [[astrology]] as yet another ''superstitio absurdissima'' of the heathens: \"What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?\".<ref>\"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci\", Random House, New York, 1953. Book One, Chapter 9, pp. 84–85. This text appears in pp. 103–04 of Book One of the original Latin text by Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&lr=&pg=RA1-PA3#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu'']</ref>

Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.<ref>Andrew L. March. 'An Appreciation of Chinese Geomancy' in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (February 1968), pp. 253–67.</ref> In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W.

After the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a \"feudalistic superstitious practice\" and a \"social evil\" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |title=Chang Liang (pseudoym), 14 January 2005, ''What Does Superstitious Belief of 'Feng Shui' Among School Students Reveal?'' |publisher=Zjc.zjol.com.cn |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306142756/http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx |title=Tao Shilong, 3 April 2006, ''The Crooked Evil of 'Feng Shui' Is Corrupting The Minds of Chinese People'' |access-date=2007-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215003742/http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx |archive-date=2008-02-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], where traditional culture was not suppressed.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/8206601/Hong-Kong-government-spends-millions-on-feng-shui.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Hong Kong government spends millions on feng shui | date=2010-12-16}}</ref>

Persecution was the most severe during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called [[Four Olds]] to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] and their works burned. After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's [[China]]. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of \"promoting feudalistic superstitions\" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.<ref>[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}</ref> Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title=\"風水迷信\"困擾中國當局 – Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref>

===Contemporary feng shui===
Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:<ref>Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340–361.</ref>

<blockquote>It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.<ref>Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui\" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)</ref></blockquote>

Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different branches of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: \"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork\".<ref>Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T & T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834</ref><ref>Monty Vierra. Harried by \"Hellions\" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.</ref> Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.

<blockquote>This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.<ref>Mark Johnson, \"Reality Testing in Feng Shui.\" ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997, as cited in Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169–85.</ref></blockquote>

Nonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:

<blockquote>...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age \"energy\" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.<ref name=\"The Skeptic's Dictionary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref></blockquote>

Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting \"lucky bamboo\" in ecosystems that could not handle them.<ref name=\"Fabulous Feng Shui\">Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&src= \"Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine</ref>

Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in [[Gansu]], on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton \"spirit rock\" to the county seat to ward off \"bad luck.\"<ref name=NYT51013>{{cite news|title=China Officials Seek Career Shortcut With Feng Shui|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/feng-shui-grows-in-china-as-officials-seek-success.html|accessdate=May 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013|author=Dan Levin}}</ref>

The stage magician duo [[Penn and Teller]] dedicated an episode of their ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of feng shui in the Western world as [[science]]. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different feng shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of feng shui.

==Contemporary practice ==

Many Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}<!-- I hope this \"it\" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --> is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.<ref name=\"''Journal of Popular Culture''1\">{{harvp|Emmons|1992| p=42}}</ref> Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.<ref name=\"''Journal of Popular Culture''2\">{{harvp|Emmons|1992| p=46}}</ref>

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.

Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,<ref name=\"Journal of Popular Culture''3\">{{harvp|Emmons|1992| p=48}}</ref> in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.<ref name=\"Feng Shui Kingdom\">Laura M.

At [[Singapore polytechnic|Singapore Polytechnic]] and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and [[interior design]]ers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or [[geomancy]]) consultants eventually.<ref name=\"AsiaOne\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090206-119946.html |title=Feng Shui course gains popularity |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref>

Since the first incarnation, the Bowie knife has come to incorporate several recognizable and characteristic design features, although in common usage the term refers to any large [[sheath knife]] with a [[crossguard]] and a [[clip point]].<ref>Todd, Frederick P., ''American Military Equipage, 1851–1872'', Scribners (1980), pp. 180–181: \"The American fighting knife of the mid-19th century was par excellence the 'bowie knife'. The term itself defied definition in those days as it does today, but a rough description would be a large sheath knife, usually with a small cross guard and a clipped point, whose story began in the American Southwest about 1830.\"</ref> The knife pattern is still popular with collectors; in addition to various knife manufacturing companies there are hundreds of custom knife makers producing Bowie knives with different types of steel<ref>{{cite web | title = Damascus Steel Bowie Knives | url = https://esaleknives.com/product-category/damascus-bowie-knives/ | publisher = eSaleKnives | accessdate = 14 April 2020}}</ref>  and variations.

==Historical complications==
The early history of the Bowie knife is complicated by murky definitions, limited supporting documentation, and conflicting claims. The Bowie knife is not well defined. By the mid-20th century most would include some combination of blade length and blade shape. In the mid-19th century, when the popularity of the knife was at its peak, the term was applied to a wide range of blades.<ref>{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Howard L. | title = American Knives; The First History and Collector's Guide | publisher = Gun Room Press | location = Highland Park, N. J. | year = 1958 | page = 26}} Four definitions of \"Bowie\" knives had supporters (in the mid-20th century). All agree that they are sheath knives (basically short swords with a handle and a blade optionally separated by a guard). Some require a blade length; some require a clipped blade; some require both; some require neither for knives produced between 1830 and 1890.</ref>  Absent a consensus definition, it is impossible to clearly define the origin of the knife. To complicate matters, some American blades that meet the modern definition of the Bowie knife may pre-date Bowie.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | page = 345}} \"Nor was the \"clip point\" unknown in America, pre-Jim Bowie.\"  (Accompanied by examples and references.)</ref>

The Bowie knife derives part of its name and reputation from [[James Bowie]], a notorious [[knife fight]]er, who died at the Alamo. James Bowie left a very thin paper trail; in the absence of verifiable facts, his history was buried in unverifiable knife-fighting legend. Historians seriously entertain the possibility that Bowie only fought one personal knife fight<ref>{{cite book | last = Davis | first = William C. | authorlink= William C. Davis (historian)| title = Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis | publisher = HarperCollins | location = New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-06-017334-3 | page = 638}} \"More nonsense has been written over the last century and a half about James Bowie and the Bowie knife than any other episode in his heavily mythologized life.\"  \"However, there is no verifiable account of him ever using any knife in a fight except once, in the Sandbar brawl, and there is no reason at all to doubt the statement of Rezin Bowie{{nbsp}}...\"</ref> (and that was not fought with a blade meeting the modern definition if Rezin Bowie's account is true). That [[Sandbar Fight]] received national publicity (accounts in Philadelphia, New York, and the ''Niles' Register'' of Washington, D.C.) within months of the event. James Bowie prominently wore a large knife after the Sandbar fight.

The Bowie family provided a variety of conflicting knife histories. James Bowie left nothing. His brother [[Rezin Bowie]] provided a terse history two years after James' death. Sixteen years after James' death someone (assumed to be James' brother John) slightly amended Rezin's explanation to include a blacksmith. Rezin's grandchildren named a different blacksmith. A later Bowie claimed that the information attributed to John was a lie and that John probably never saw the document, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J. R. | title = The Alamo story from early history to current conflicts | publisher = Republic of Texas Press | location = Plano, Tex | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1556226786 | pages = 121–123 }} \"If James Bowie ever wrote a single word about the original Bowie knife, that document has not surfaced. Unfortunately, even those who saw the knife could not agree about its dimensions.\" (Descriptions)  \"Curiously, Rezin's grandchildren contradicted their grandfather by asserting that Rezin's blacksmith, Jesse Clifft, actually forged the knife under Rezin's supervision. John Bowie and Caiaphas Ham both credited the knife to a blacksmith from Kentucky named Lovell Snowden.\"</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | pages = 68–69}}  Rezin Bowie's account is given in full and termed the \"most important letter in Bowiedom\".</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | page = 71}} Quotes of the later Bowie on John's presumed work: \"...{{nbsp}}every statement I find untrue.\"  \"It is probable that John J. Bowie never knew of the article.\"</ref>

In the mid-20th century, a Bowie knife book author took liberties with the historical facts. Some documents were misquoted, some reported facts cannot be confirmed, etc. Others incorporated the errors into their accounts of both Bowie and his knives.<ref name=Davis>{{cite book | last = Davis | first = William C. | authorlink= William C.

With no solid definition and conflicting accounts of knife history, many were credited with the invention or improvement of the blade.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J. R. | title = The Alamo story from early history to current conflicts | publisher = Republic of Texas Press | location = Plano, Tex | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1556226786 | pages = 121–123}}  \"More than a dozen men have been credited with its invention; accordingly there exist a broad diversity of descriptions and dimensions; and at least as many men claimed to have acquired the knife.\"</ref>

==Origin and description==
[[File:Fowlerkn.JPG|thumb|right|An early Bowie of the type made for Rezin Bowie and commissioned by the Bowies to Searles and Constable. This is a copy of the Fowler Bowie currently displayed at the Alamo.]]

The historical Bowie knife was not a single design, but was a series of knives improved several times by Jim Bowie over the years.<ref name =\"walker\">Walker, Greg (1993). ''Battle Blades: A Professional's Guide to Combat/Fighting Knives'' (Hardcover), pages 210 {{ISBN|0-87364-732-7}}</ref>  The earliest such knife, made by Jesse Clift at Bowie's brother Rezin's request resembled Spanish hunting knives of the day, and differed little from a common [[butcher knife]].<ref name =\"walker\"/> The blade, as later described by Rezin Bowie, was {{cvt|9+1/2|in|cm}} long, {{cvt|1/4|in|mm|1}} thick and {{cvt|1+1/2|in|cm}} wide. It was straight-backed, described by witnesses as \"a large butcher knife\", and having no clip-point nor any [[handguard]], with a simple [[rivet]]ed wood scale handle.<ref name =\"MC\"/>

Bernard Levine has reported that the first known Bowie knife showed a strong [[Mediterranean]] influence insofar as general lines were concerned, particularly the shape of the traditional Spanish folding knife, then often carried by immigrants to Mexico and other territories of the [[Old Southwest]].<ref>Levine, Bernard. (2002).''Knives and their Values'', p. 64</ref>  In an 1828 account of the capture of a pirate schooner carrying a mixed group of Spanish and South American pirates, the carrying of knives similar to the early Bowie knife is mentioned:

{{quote|Amongst these [weapons], were a large number of long knives – weapons which the Spaniards use very dexterously. They are about the size of a common English carving knife, but for several inches up the blade cut both sides.<ref>Wood, Enoch, ''An Account of the Pirates Executed at St. Christopher's, in the West Indies, in 1828'', London: John Mason (1830)</ref>}}

After the Vidalia Sandbar fight, Bowie was a famous man, and the Bowie brothers received many requests for knives of the same design. Bowie and his brothers would later commission more ornate custom blades from various knife makers including Daniel Searles and John Constable.<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite journal |last = Cumpston|first= Mike|title = The American Excalibur: Jim Bowie's lethal legacy | journal = Guns Magazine| date = 2007-04-01|volume=57|issue=4}}</ref>   [[George William Featherstonhaugh]] described them as, \"These formidable instruments ... are the pride of an Arkansas blood, and got their name of Bowie knives from a conspicuous person of this fiery climate.\"<ref name=\"Featherstonhaugh\">{{Cite journal | last = Featherstonhaugh | first = George William | authorlink = George William Featherstonhaugh | title = Excursion Through The Slave States, From Washington On The Potomac To The Frontier Of Mexico | year = 1844 }}</ref>

According to an 1847 article, the Bowie knife was originally designed to fill the need for a wearable, convenient, close-combat weapon -  a short sword much shorter than the [[saber]] or other swords of the day, yet still possessing a heavy blade. This cleaver-like blade had enough weight to give the blade sufficient force in a slashing attack, while permitting the use of cut-and-thrust sword fighting tactics.<ref name=\"ROB\"/>  By this time the 'Bowie knife' was already being made in a variety of sizes, with the optimum blade length similar to \"that of a carving knife\".<ref name=\"ROB\">[[Joseph Clinton Robertson|Robertson, J. C.]], (ed.), ''The Bowie Knife and its Inventor'', The Mechanic's Magazine, Museum, Register, and Gazette, Vol. 46, No. 1231 London: Robertson & Co.

Most later versions of the Bowie knife had a [[blade]] of at least {{convert|8|in|cm}} in length, some reaching {{convert|12|in|cm}} or more, with a relatively broad blade that was {{convert|1+1/2|to|2|in|cm|spell=in}} wide and made of [[steel]] usually between {{convert|3/16|to|1/4|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} thick. The back of the blade sometimes had a strip of soft metal (normally [[brass]] or [[copper]]) inlaid which some believe was intended to catch an opponent's blade while others hold it was intended to provide support and absorb shock to help prevent breaking of poor quality steel or poorly heat treated blades. (A brass back is an indication of modern construction.<ref>{{cite book| last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | pages = 464–466}}  \"[N]o authenticated brass back Bowie has yet to be accepted in all quarters as genuine{{nbsp}}...\".</ref>)  Bowie knives often had an upper guard that bent forward at an angle (an [[S-guard]]) intended to catch an opponent's blade or provide protection to the owner's hand during parries and corps-a-corps.

Some Bowie knives had a notch on the bottom of the blade near the [[hilt]] known as a \"Spanish Notch\". The Spanish Notch is often cited as a mechanism for catching an opponent's blade; however, some Bowie researchers hold that the Spanish Notch is ill-suited to this function and frequently fails to achieve the desired results. These researchers, instead, hold that the Spanish Notch has the much more mundane function as a tool for stripping [[sinew]] and repairing [[rope]] and nets, as a guide to assist in sharpening the blade (assuring that the sharpening process starts at a specific point and not further up the edge), or as a point to relieve stress on the blade during use.

One characteristic of Bowie knives is the [[clip point]] at the top of the blade, which brings the tip of the blade lower than the spine and in line with the handle for better control during thrusting attacks. As the goal is to produce a sharp, stabbing point, most Bowie knives have a bevel ground along the clip, typically 1/4 of the way, but sometimes much further running the entire top-edge. This is referred to as a false [[edge]] as from a distance it looks sharpened, although it may or may not be. Regardless of whether or not the false edge is sharp, it serves to take metal away from the point, streamlining the tip and thus enhancing the penetration capability of the blade during a stab. The version attributed to blacksmith James Black had this false edge fully sharpened in order to allow someone trained in European techniques of [[Sabre (fencing)|saber fencing]] to execute the maneuver called the \"back cut\" or \"back slash\"..<ref name=\"MC\"/>  A brass [[quillon]], usually cast in a mold, was attached to protect the hand.

The Bowie knife's design also lends itself to use as a hunting knife for skinning or butchering game. The curved top clip bevel of the blade, when suitably sharpened, may be used to remove the skin from a [[Cadaver|carcass]], while the straight portion of the blade edge, toward the guard, can be used for cutting meat. Arkansas culturalist and researcher Russell T. Johnson describes the [[James Black]] knife in the following manner and at the same time captures the quintessence of the Bowie Knife: \"It must be long enough to use as a sword, sharp enough to use as a razor, wide enough to use as a paddle, and heavy enough to use as a hatchet.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/><ref name=\"RJ\"/>  Most such knives intended for hunting are only sharpened on one edge, to reduce the danger of cutting oneself while butchering and [[skinning]] the carcass.

== History ==
=== The Vidalia Sandbar Fight ===
[[File:Coffin handle bowie knife.jpg|thumb|right|A coffin-handled Bowie knife]]
{{Main|Sandbar Fight}}

The first knife, with which Bowie became famous, allegedly was designed by Jim Bowie's brother Rezin in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana]] and smithed by blacksmith Jesse Clifft out of an old file.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Period court documents indicate that [[Rezin Bowie]] and Clifft were well acquainted with one another. Rezin's granddaughter claimed in an 1885 letter to [[Louisiana State University]] that she personally witnessed Clifft make the knife for her grandfather.

This knife became famous as the knife used by Bowie at the [[Sandbar Fight]], a famous 1827 [[duel]] between Bowie and several men including a Major Norris Wright of [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  The fight took place on a [[sandbar]] in the [[Mississippi River]] across from [[Natchez, Mississippi]], and is the only documented fight in which Bowie was known to have employed his Bowie knife design. In this battle Bowie was stabbed, shot, and beaten half to death but managed to win the fight using the large knife.<ref name =\"MC\"/>

Jim Bowie's older brother John would later claim that the knife at the Sandbar Fight was not Clifft's knife, but a knife specifically made for Bowie by a blacksmith named Snowden.<ref name=\"Shackleford2010\">{{cite book|last=Shackleford|first=Steve |title=Blade's Guide to Knives & Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6NZd17WtWoC&pg=PA307|accessdate=27 January 2012|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-0387-9|page=307}}</ref>

The most famous version of the Bowie knife was designed by Jim Bowie and presented to [[Arkansas]] [[blacksmith]] [[James Black (blacksmith)|James Black]] in the form of a carved wooden model in December 1830.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Black produced the knife ordered by Bowie, and at the same time created another based on Bowie's original design but with a sharpened edge on the curved top edge of the blade.

The fate of the original Bowie knife is unknown; however, a knife bearing the engraving \"Bowie No. 1\" has been acquired by the [[Historic Arkansas Museum]] from a Texas collector and has been attributed to Black through scientific analysis.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

Black soon had a booming business making and selling these knives out of his shop in [[Washington, Arkansas]]. Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife's death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade.

Black's knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true [[Damascus steel]].<ref name=\"RJ\"/>

In 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, [[Daniel Webster Jones (governor)|Daniel Webster Jones]]. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.

The birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the [[Old Washington Historic State Park]] which has over 40 restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black's shop. The park is known as \"The [[Colonial Williamsburg]] of Arkansas\". The [[American Bladesmith Society]] established the [[William F. Moran]] School of Bladesmithing at this site to instruct new apprentices as well as journeyman, and mastersmiths in the art of bladesmithing.<ref name=ark>{{cite web|title=Bill Moran Jr. (1925–2006)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4057|work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|accessdate=2011-03-08|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723115729/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4057|archivedate=2011-07-23}}</ref>

The term \"Bowie knife\" appeared in advertising (multiple places) by 1835, about 8 years after the sandbar brawl, while James Bowie was still alive. From context, \"Bowie knife\" needed no description then, but the spelling was variable. Among the first mentions was a plan to combine a Bowie knife and pistol. Cutlers were shipping sheath knives from Sheffield England by the early 1830s. By 1838 a writer in a Baltimore newspaper (posted from New Orleans) suggested that every reader had seen a Bowie knife.<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>

The Bowie knife found its greatest popularity in the [[Old Southwest]] of the mid-19th century. However, accounts of Bowie knife fighting schools are based on fiction; newspapers of the era in the region contained advertisements for classes in fencing and self-defense.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-931464-12-3 | pages = 312 }}  Chapter 11: \"Bowie Knife Duels, Rules, Manuals ... and Schools - Dueling in American Folkways and Folklore\"  \"... &nbsp;the evidence for \"knife schools in all the major cities\" fails to support or corroborate their presence.\"  [[Charles Dickens]]' fictional [[Great Expectations]] was quoted as proof of the existence of knife fighting schools.</ref>

Bowie knives had a role in the American conflicts of the nineteenth century. They are historically mentioned in the independence of Texas, in the Mexican War, the California gold rush, the [[Bleeding Kansas|civil strife in Kansas]], the Civil War and later conflicts with the American Indians.  [[John Brown (abolitionist)]] carried a Bowie (which was taken by [[J. E. B. Stuart]]). (p 117)  [[John Wilkes Booth]] (assassin of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) dropped a large Bowie knife as he escaped. (p 158)  \"[[Buffalo Bill]]\" Cody ''reportedly'' scalped a sub-chief in 1876 in revenge for Custer (the [[Battle of Warbonnet Creek]]). An illustration of the reputed event showed a Bowie knife. (p 171)<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>

The popularity of the Bowie knife declined late in the nineteenth century. Large-caliber and reliable [[revolver]]s were available by the mid-1870s, reducing a knife advantage. Prior to the Civil War most handguns were single- or double-barrel muzzle-loaders, and the [[percussion cap]] was considered a great leap forward in reliability even then; multiple shot [[pepperbox]]es and crude revolvers were available, but often in small caliber, highly unreliable, and expensive. The Civil War popularized six-shot [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Smith & Wesson]]-type revolvers which contained a sufficient number of lethal shot to make it possible to carry the firearm alone, without a major backup weapon, unlike earlier pistols which left the user defenseless once they had been fired. The frontier rapidly vanished, reducing the number of hunters and trappers. Large knives had limited utility, so Bowies shrunk.

The [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Ka-Bar]] of [[World War II]] fame is based on the Bowie design.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Walker  | first = Greg  | title = KA-BAR: The Next Generation of the Ultimate Fighting Knife  | place = Boulder, Colorado  | publisher = Paladin Press   | year = 2001  | isbn = 1-58160-120-4}}</ref>

Since the 1960s, Bowie knives with sawteeth machined into the back side of the blade appeared inspired by the [[Aircrew Survival Egress Knife|United States Air Force survival knife]] (NSN 7340-00-098-4327). The sawteeth were intended to cut through the [[acrylic glass]] canopy of a downed aircraft. During the [[Vietnam War]] the [[United States Army]] issued them to [[helicopter]] crews for the same purpose.

On July 27, 1969, [[Manson Family|Manson associate]] [[Bobby Beausoleil]] murdered Gary Hinman by stabbing him with a Bowie knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/photo-archive/beausoleil-hinman-murder-knife-01.php|title=Bobby Beausoleil's Bowie Knife and Buckskin Sheath - Charles Manson Family and Sharon Tate-Labianca Murders - Cielodrive.com|author=|date=|website=www.cielodrive.com|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>

== Variations, collecting and portrayal in popular culture ==
Jim Bowie was posthumously inducted into the [[Blade (magazine)|Blade Magazine]] Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in recognition for the impact that his design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.

[[File:Krag Bowie Bayonet.JPG|thumb|Krag Bowie bayonet US stamped, on the reverse date 1900]]

Custom knife maker [[Ernest Emerson]] originally used a Bowie knife in his logo and manufactures a folding Bowie known in his line-up as the CQC13.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Norman | first=Chris| title=Ernest Emerson | journal=Knives Illustrated |volume=10 |issue=4| year=1995 | pages=104–108 }}</ref>

A Bowie knife appears on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the [[39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]], headquartered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].

===Variations===
Among the many variations on Bowie knives (discussed or shown by Flayderman or Peterson) are Bowies with interchangeable blades, push daggers, double-ended Bowies, folding Bowies, Bowies with a cork screw or other accessories, Bowie bayonets, combination Bowie/pistols, a Bowie with a saw-toothed back and Confederate Bowies with D-guards. Some were works of fine art. A giant folding Bowie, almost {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length and weighing {{convert|34|lb|kg}} was made for presentation to an American congressman who ''offered'' to engage in a knife duel (a dispute between [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]] and [[John F. Potter]]). A few huge Bowies up to {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long were created for exhibition.

Over the years many knives have been called Bowie knives and the term has almost become a generic term for any large sheath knife. During the early days of the [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers carried immense knives called [[D-Guard Bowie knives]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Many of these knives could have qualified as short [[sword]]s and were often made from old saw or [[scythe]] blades.

The Bowie knife is sometimes confused with the \"[[Arkansas toothpick]],\" possibly due to the interchangeable use of the names \"Arkansas toothpick\", \"Bowie knife\", and \"Arkansas knife\" in the antebellum period.<ref name=ark/>  The Arkansas toothpick is essentially a heavy [[dagger]] with a straight {{convert|15|-|25|in|cm}} blade. While balanced and weighted for throwing, the toothpick can be used for thrusting and slashing. Although James Black is popularly credited with inventing the \"Arkansas Toothpick\", no firm evidence exists for this claim.<ref name=\"RJ\"/>

Knives made in [[Sheffield]], England, were quick to enter the market with \"Bowie Knives\" of a distinctive pattern that most modern users identify with the true form Bowie. The Sheffield pattern blade is thinner than the Black/Musso knives, while the false edge is often longer, with a more oblique and less pronounced clip edge.<ref name=\"MC\"/>  While the Bowie is often considered a uniquely American knife, most blades were produced in Sheffield England.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J.

===Collecting===
During the late 19th and 20th centuries, the Bowie knife served usefully as a camp and hunting tool as well as a weapon, and is still popular with some hunters and trappers in the present day.<ref name=\"MC\"/>  However, as today's campers and backpackers generally rely on prepared lightweight foods, and have little or no use for a large knife as a weapon or for butchering wild game animals, the traditional Bowie pattern knife is today mostly purchased by collectors or edged weapon enthusiasts.<ref name =\"Miracle\">Miracle, Leonard, ''Complete Book of Camping'', HarperCollins (2000), {{ISBN|978-0-06-071230-3}}, p. 160.</ref>

===Portrayal in popular culture===
The Bowie knife has been present in popular culture throughout the ages, ranging from the days of the Western dime novels and pulps, to Literary Fiction such as the 1897 classic vampire novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by Irish author Bram Stoker. Despite the popular image of Count Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of the story, Dracula is actually killed by his heart being pierced by Quincey Morris's Bowie knife and his throat being sliced by Jonathan Harker's [[kukri]] knife. Bowie knives appeared in the classic works of Americans [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and [[Mark Twain]], Englishman [[Charles Dickens]], and Frenchman [[Jules Verne]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | pages = 72–73}}</ref>

The Bowie knife has also appeared in television and cinema such as the largely fictional 1952 film ''[[The Iron Mistress]]'' (directed by Alan Ladd, and loosely based on the life of James Bowie) and the 1950s television series ''[[The Adventures of Jim Bowie]]''. At the end of [[John Ford]]’s film ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956), [[John Wayne]]’s character Ethan Edwards uses a Bowie knife to scalp the Comanche Indian chief 'Scar' he has been hunting throughout the film.

The Bowie knife was a staple in ''The Alamo'' movies of [[The Alamo (1960 film)|1960]] and [[The Alamo (2004 film)|2004]]; the first three Rambo movies, ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982), ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), and ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988); the film ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' (1986) and its sequel ''[[Crocodile Dundee II]]'' (1988); and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980).<ref name=\"HOF\">{{cite news |title = Bowie Inducted into the Hall of Fame| work = Blade Magazine| date = 1988-08-01}}</ref>

<blockquote>That if any person carrying any knife or weapon known as a Bowie knife ... or any knife or weapon that shall in form, shape, or size resemble a Bowie knife, on a sudden encounter, shall cut or stab another person with such knife or weapon, whether death ensues or not, such person so stabbing or cutting shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be confined in the jail and penitentiary house of this State, for a period of time not less than three years, nor more than fifteen years.<ref name=\"CRA\"/><ref>Cramer, pp. 111–112: So great was public pressure to clamp down on use of the Bowie knife that the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the law two years later (''Aymette v.

In modern-day [[Texas]], the state Jim Bowie died defending, the carrying of a Bowie knife \"on or about one's person\" in public places was specifically regulated under state law until 2017.<ref name=\"TEX46\"/> This law has been changed effective September 1, 2017.

It is argued that the terms \"Bowie Knife\" and \"Arkansas Toothpick\" are too subjective to form the basis of sound legislation.<ref>{{cite web | title = AKTI Approved Knife Definitions | url = http://www.akti.org/resources/akti-approved-knife-definitions | publisher = American Knife and Tool Institute | accessdate = 29 July 2019 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206074033/http://www.akti.org/resources/akti-approved-knife-definitions/ | archivedate = 2015-02-06 }}  \"In the intervening 170 or so years since the Natchez Sandbar duel, the label 'Bowie Knife' has been applied to a wide variety of styles.

Since the first incarnation, the Bowie knife has come to incorporate several recognizable and characteristic design features, although in common usage the term refers to any large [[sheath knife]] with a [[crossguard]] and a [[clip point]].<ref>Todd, Frederick P., ''American Military Equipage, 1851–1872'', Scribners (1980), pp. 180–181: \"The American fighting knife of the mid-19th century was par excellence the 'bowie knife'. The term itself defied definition in those days as it does today, but a rough description would be a large sheath knife, usually with a small cross guard and a clipped point, whose story began in the American Southwest about 1830.\"</ref> The knife pattern is still popular with collectors; in addition to various knife manufacturing companies there are hundreds of custom knife makers producing Bowies and variations.

==Historical complications==
The early history of the Bowie knife is complicated by murky definitions, limited supporting documentation, and conflicting claims. The Bowie knife is not well defined. By the mid-20th century most would include some combination of blade length and blade shape. In the mid-19th century, when the popularity of the knife was at its peak, the term was applied to a wide range of blades.<ref>{{cite book | last = Peterson | first = Howard L. | title = American Knives; The First History and Collector's Guide | publisher = Gun Room Press | location = Highland Park, N. J. | year = 1958 | page = 26}} Four definitions of \"Bowie\" knives had supporters (in the mid-20th century). All agree that they are sheath knives (basically short swords with a handle and a blade optionally separated by a guard). Some require a blade length; some require a clipped blade; some require both; some require neither for knives produced between 1830 and 1890.</ref>  Absent a consensus definition, it is impossible to clearly define the origin of the knife. To complicate matters, some American blades that meet the modern definition of the Bowie knife may pre-date Bowie.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | page = 345}} \"Nor was the \"clip point\" unknown in America, pre-Jim Bowie.\"  (Accompanied by examples and references.)</ref>

The Bowie knife derives part of its name and reputation from [[James Bowie]], a notorious [[knife fight]]er, who died at the Alamo. James Bowie left a very thin paper trail; in the absence of verifiable facts, his history was buried in unverifiable knife-fighting legend. Historians seriously entertain the possibility that Bowie only fought one personal knife fight<ref>{{cite book | last = Davis | first = William C. | authorlink= William C. Davis (historian)| title = Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis | publisher = HarperCollins | location = New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-06-017334-3 | page = 638}} \"More nonsense has been written over the last century and a half about James Bowie and the Bowie knife than any other episode in his heavily mythologized life.\"  \"However, there is no verifiable account of him ever using any knife in a fight except once, in the Sandbar brawl, and there is no reason at all to doubt the statement of Rezin Bowie{{nbsp}}...\"</ref> (and that was not fought with a blade meeting the modern definition if Rezin Bowie's account is true). That [[Sandbar Fight]] received national publicity (accounts in Philadelphia, New York, and the ''Niles' Register'' of Washington, D.C.) within months of the event. James Bowie prominently wore a large knife after the Sandbar fight.

The Bowie family provided a variety of conflicting knife histories. James Bowie left nothing. His brother [[Rezin Bowie]] provided a terse history two years after James' death. Sixteen years after James' death someone (assumed to be James' brother John) slightly amended Rezin's explanation to include a blacksmith. Rezin's grandchildren named a different blacksmith. A later Bowie claimed that the information attributed to John was a lie and that John probably never saw the document, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J. R. | title = The Alamo story from early history to current conflicts | publisher = Republic of Texas Press | location = Plano, Tex | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1556226786 | pages = 121–123 }} \"If James Bowie ever wrote a single word about the original Bowie knife, that document has not surfaced. Unfortunately, even those who saw the knife could not agree about its dimensions.\" (Descriptions)  \"Curiously, Rezin's grandchildren contradicted their grandfather by asserting that Rezin's blacksmith, Jesse Clifft, actually forged the knife under Rezin's supervision.

In the mid-20th century, a Bowie knife book author took liberties with the historical facts. Some documents were misquoted, some reported facts cannot be confirmed, etc. Others incorporated the errors into their accounts of both Bowie and his knives.<ref name=Davis>{{cite book | last = Davis | first = William C. | authorlink= William C.

With no solid definition and conflicting accounts of knife history, many were credited with the invention or improvement of the blade.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J.

==Origin and description==
[[File:Fowlerkn.JPG|thumb|right|An early Bowie of the type made for Rezin Bowie and commissioned by the Bowies to Searles and Constable. This is a copy of the Fowler Bowie currently displayed at the Alamo.]]

The historical Bowie knife was not a single design, but was a series of knives improved several times by Jim Bowie over the years.<ref name =\"walker\">Walker, Greg (1993). ''Battle Blades: A Professional's Guide to Combat/Fighting Knives'' (Hardcover), pages 210 {{ISBN|0-87364-732-7}}</ref>  The earliest such knife, made by Jesse Clift at Bowie's brother Rezin's request resembled Spanish hunting knives of the day, and differed little from a common [[butcher knife]].<ref name =\"walker\"/> The blade, as later described by Rezin Bowie, was {{cvt|9+1/2|in|cm}} long, {{cvt|1/4|in|mm|1}} thick and {{cvt|1+1/2|in|cm}} wide. It was straight-backed, described by witnesses as \"a large butcher knife\", and having no clip-point nor any [[handguard]], with a simple [[rivet]]ed wood scale handle.<ref name =\"MC\"/>

Bernard Levine has reported that the first known Bowie knife showed a strong [[Mediterranean]] influence insofar as general lines were concerned, particularly the shape of the traditional Spanish folding knife, then often carried by immigrants to Mexico and other territories of the [[Old Southwest]].<ref>Levine, Bernard. (2002).''Knives and their Values'', p. 64</ref>  In an 1828 account of the capture of a pirate schooner carrying a mixed group of Spanish and South American pirates, the carrying of knives similar to the early Bowie knife is mentioned:

{{quote|Amongst these [weapons], were a large number of long knives – weapons which the Spaniards use very dexterously. They are about the size of a common English carving knife, but for several inches up the blade cut both sides.<ref>Wood, Enoch, ''An Account of the Pirates Executed at St. Christopher's, in the West Indies, in 1828'', London: John Mason (1830)</ref>}}

After the Vidalia Sandbar fight, Bowie was a famous man, and the Bowie brothers received many requests for knives of the same design. Bowie and his brothers would later commission more ornate custom blades from various knife makers including Daniel Searles and John Constable.<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite journal |last = Cumpston|first= Mike|title = The American Excalibur: Jim Bowie's lethal legacy | journal = Guns Magazine| date = 2007-04-01|volume=57|issue=4}}</ref>   [[George William Featherstonhaugh]] described them as, \"These formidable instruments ... are the pride of an Arkansas blood, and got their name of Bowie knives from a conspicuous person of this fiery climate.\"<ref name=\"Featherstonhaugh\">{{Cite journal | last = Featherstonhaugh | first = George William | authorlink = George William Featherstonhaugh | title = Excursion Through The Slave States, From Washington On The Potomac To The Frontier Of Mexico | year = 1844 }}</ref>

According to an 1847 article, the Bowie knife was originally designed to fill the need for a wearable, convenient, close-combat weapon -  a short sword much shorter than the [[saber]] or other swords of the day, yet still possessing a heavy blade. This cleaver-like blade had enough weight to give the blade sufficient force in a slashing attack, while permitting the use of cut-and-thrust sword fighting tactics.<ref name=\"ROB\"/>  By this time the 'Bowie knife' was already being made in a variety of sizes, with the optimum blade length similar to \"that of a carving knife\".<ref name=\"ROB\">[[Joseph Clinton Robertson|Robertson, J. C.]], (ed.), ''The Bowie Knife and its Inventor'', The Mechanic's Magazine, Museum, Register, and Gazette, Vol. 46, No. 1231 London: Robertson & Co.

Most later versions of the Bowie knife had a [[blade]] of at least {{convert|8|in|cm}} in length, some reaching {{convert|12|in|cm}} or more, with a relatively broad blade that was {{convert|1+1/2|to|2|in|cm|spell=in}} wide and made of [[steel]] usually between {{convert|3/16|to|1/4|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} thick. The back of the blade sometimes had a strip of soft metal (normally [[brass]] or [[copper]]) inlaid which some believe was intended to catch an opponent's blade while others hold it was intended to provide support and absorb shock to help prevent breaking of poor quality steel or poorly heat treated blades. (A brass back is an indication of modern construction.<ref>{{cite book| last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | pages = 464–466}}  \"[N]o authenticated brass back Bowie has yet to be accepted in all quarters as genuine{{nbsp}}...\".</ref>)  Bowie knives often had an upper guard that bent forward at an angle (an [[S-guard]]) intended to catch an opponent's blade or provide protection to the owner's hand during parries and corps-a-corps.

Some Bowie knives had a notch on the bottom of the blade near the [[hilt]] known as a \"Spanish Notch\". The Spanish Notch is often cited as a mechanism for catching an opponent's blade; however, some Bowie researchers hold that the Spanish Notch is ill-suited to this function and frequently fails to achieve the desired results. These researchers, instead, hold that the Spanish Notch has the much more mundane function as a tool for stripping [[sinew]] and repairing [[rope]] and nets, as a guide to assist in sharpening the blade (assuring that the sharpening process starts at a specific point and not further up the edge), or as a point to relieve stress on the blade during use.

One characteristic of Bowie knives is the [[clip point]] at the top of the blade, which brings the tip of the blade lower than the spine and in line with the handle for better control during thrusting attacks. As the goal is to produce a sharp, stabbing point, most Bowie knives have a bevel ground along the clip, typically 1/4 of the way, but sometimes much further running the entire top-edge. This is referred to as a [[false edge]] as from a distance it looks sharpened, although it may or may not be. Regardless of whether or not the false edge is sharp, it serves to take metal away from the point, streamlining the tip and thus enhancing the penetration capability of the blade during a stab. The version attributed to blacksmith James Black had this false edge fully sharpened in order to allow someone trained in European techniques of [[Sabre (fencing)|saber fencing]] to execute the maneuver called the \"back cut\" or \"back slash\"..<ref name=\"MC\"/>  A brass [[quillon]], usually cast in a mold, was attached to protect the hand.

The Bowie knife's design also lends itself to use as a hunting knife for skinning or butchering game. The curved top clip bevel of the blade, when suitably sharpened, may be used to remove the skin from a [[Cadaver|carcass]], while the straight portion of the blade edge, toward the guard, can be used for cutting meat. Arkansas culturalist and researcher Russell T. Johnson describes the [[James Black knife]] in the following manner and at the same time captures the quintessence of the Bowie Knife: \"It must be long enough to use as a sword, sharp enough to use as a razor, wide enough to use as a paddle, and heavy enough to use as a hatchet.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/><ref name=\"RJ\"/>  Most such knives intended for hunting are only sharpened on one edge, to reduce the danger of cutting oneself while butchering and [[skinning]] the carcass.

== History ==
=== The Vidalia Sandbar Fight ===
[[File:Coffin handle bowie knife.jpg|thumb|right|A coffin-handled Bowie knife]]
{{Main|Sandbar Fight}}

The first knife, with which Bowie became famous, allegedly was designed by Jim Bowie's brother Rezin in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana]] and smithed by blacksmith Jesse Clifft out of an old file.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Period court documents indicate that [[Rezin Bowie]] and Clifft were well acquainted with one another. Rezin's granddaughter claimed in an 1885 letter to [[Louisiana State University]] that she personally witnessed Clifft make the knife for her grandfather.

This knife became famous as the knife used by Bowie at the [[Sandbar Fight]], a famous 1827 [[duel]] between Bowie and several men including a Major Norris Wright of [[Alexandria, Louisiana]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  The fight took place on a [[sandbar]] in the [[Mississippi River]] across from [[Natchez, Mississippi]], and is the only documented fight in which Bowie was known to have employed his Bowie knife design. In this battle Bowie was stabbed, shot, and beaten half to death but managed to win the fight using the large knife.<ref name =\"MC\"/>

Jim Bowie's older brother John would later claim that the knife at the Sandbar Fight was not Clifft's knife, but a knife specifically made for Bowie by a blacksmith named Snowden.<ref name=\"Shackleford2010\">{{cite book|last=Shackleford|first=Steve |title=Blade's Guide to Knives & Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6NZd17WtWoC&pg=PA307|accessdate=27 January 2012|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-0387-9|page=307}}</ref>

=== James Black's Bowie knife ===
The most famous version of the Bowie knife was designed by Jim Bowie and presented to [[Arkansas]] [[blacksmith]] [[James Black (blacksmith)|James Black]] in the form of a carved wooden model in December 1830.<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Black produced the knife ordered by Bowie, and at the same time created another based on Bowie's original design but with a sharpened edge on the curved top edge of the blade.

The fate of the original Bowie knife is unknown; however, a knife bearing the engraving \"Bowie No. 1\" has been acquired by the [[Historic Arkansas Museum]] from a Texas collector and has been attributed to Black through scientific analysis.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

Black soon had a booming business making and selling these knives out of his shop in [[Washington, Arkansas]]. Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife's death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade.

Black's knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true [[Damascus steel]].<ref name=\"RJ\"/>

In 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, [[Daniel Webster Jones (governor)|Daniel Webster Jones]]. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.

The birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the [[Old Washington Historic State Park]] which has over 40 restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black's shop. The park is known as \"The [[Colonial Williamsburg]] of Arkansas\". The [[American Bladesmith Society]] established the [[William F. Moran]] School of Bladesmithing at this site to instruct new apprentices as well as journeyman, and mastersmiths in the art of bladesmithing.<ref name=ark>{{cite web|title=Bill Moran Jr. (1925–2006)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4057|work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|accessdate=2011-03-08|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723115729/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4057|archivedate=2011-07-23}}</ref>

===Later history===
[[File:The Photographic History of The Civil War Volume 05 Page 171.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Two members of the 25th Va Cavalry armed with Bowie knives: left Captain E. Spootswood Bishop;  right Daniel Caudill served with the 25th Virginia Cavalry and the 10th Kentucky Cavalry]]

[[File:confederateshotgun.jpg|thumb|[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cavalryman John Duponte of Dartmouth, Alabama with muzzle-loading shotgun and a \"Square D\" handle Bowie knife]]

The term \"Bowie knife\" appeared in advertising (multiple places) by 1835, about 8 years after the sandbar brawl, while James Bowie was still alive. From context, \"Bowie knife\" needed no description then, but the spelling was variable. Among the first mentions was a plan to combine a Bowie knife and pistol. Cutlers were shipping sheath knives from Sheffield England by the early 1830s. By 1838 a writer in a Baltimore newspaper (posted from New Orleans) suggested that every reader had seen a Bowie knife.<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>

The Bowie knife found its greatest popularity in the [[Old Southwest]] of the mid-19th century. However, accounts of Bowie knife fighting schools are based on fiction; newspapers of the era in the region contained advertisements for classes in fencing and self-defense.<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-931464-12-3 | pages = 312 }}  Chapter 11: \"Bowie Knife Duels, Rules, Manuals ... and Schools - Dueling in American Folkways and Folklore\"  \"... &nbsp;the evidence for \"knife schools in all the major cities\" fails to support or corroborate their presence.\"  [[Charles Dickens]]' fictional [[Great Expectations]] was quoted as proof of the existence of knife fighting schools.</ref>

Bowie knives had a role in the American conflicts of the nineteenth century. They are historically mentioned in the independence of Texas, in the Mexican War, the California gold rush, the [[Bleeding Kansas|civil strife in Kansas]], the Civil War and later conflicts with the American Indians.  [[John Brown (abolitionist)]] carried a Bowie (which was taken by [[J. E. B. Stuart]]). (p 117)  [[John Wilkes Booth]] (assassin of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) dropped a large Bowie knife as he escaped. (p 158)  \"[[Buffalo Bill]]\" Cody ''reportedly'' scalped a sub-chief in 1876 in revenge for Custer (the [[Battle of Warbonnet Creek]]). An illustration of the reputed event showed a Bowie knife. (p 171)<ref name=\"Flayderman 2004\"/>

The popularity of the Bowie knife declined late in the nineteenth century. Large-caliber and reliable [[revolver]]s were available by the mid-1870s, reducing a knife advantage. Prior to the Civil War most handguns were single- or double-barrel muzzle-loaders, and the [[percussion cap]] was considered a great leap forward in reliability even then; multiple shot [[pepperbox]]es and crude revolvers were available, but often in small caliber, highly unreliable, and expensive. The Civil War popularized six-shot [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Smith & Wesson]]-type revolvers which contained a sufficient number of lethal shot to make it possible to carry the firearm alone, without a major backup weapon, unlike earlier pistols which left the user defenseless once they had been fired. The frontier rapidly vanished, reducing the number of hunters and trappers. Large knives had limited utility, so Bowies shrunk.

The [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Ka-Bar]] of [[World War II]] fame is based on the Bowie design.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Walker  | first = Greg  | title = KA-BAR: The Next Generation of the Ultimate Fighting Knife  | place = Boulder, Colorado  | publisher = Paladin Press   | year = 2001  | isbn = 1-58160-120-4}}</ref>

Since the 1960s, Bowie knives with sawteeth machined into the back side of the blade appeared inspired by the [[Aircrew Survival Egress Knife|United States Air Force survival knife]] (NSN 7340-00-098-4327). The sawteeth were intended to cut through the [[acrylic glass]] canopy of a downed aircraft. During the [[Vietnam War]] the [[United States Army]] issued them to [[helicopter]] crews for the same purpose.

On July 27, 1969, [[Manson Family|Manson associate]] [[Bobby Beausoleil]] murdered Gary Hinman by stabbing him with a Bowie knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/photo-archive/beausoleil-hinman-murder-knife-01.php|title=Bobby Beausoleil's Bowie Knife and Buckskin Sheath - Charles Manson Family and Sharon Tate-Labianca Murders - Cielodrive.com|author=|date=|website=www.cielodrive.com|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>

== Variations, collecting and portrayal in popular culture ==
Jim Bowie was posthumously inducted into the [[Blade (magazine)|Blade Magazine]] Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 Blade Show in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in recognition for the impact that his design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.

[[File:Krag Bowie Bayonet.JPG|thumb|Krag Bowie bayonet US stamped, on the reverse date 1900]]

Custom knife maker [[Ernest Emerson]] originally used a Bowie knife in his logo and manufactures a folding Bowie known in his line-up as the CQC13.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Norman | first=Chris| title=Ernest Emerson | journal=Knives Illustrated |volume=10 |issue=4| year=1995 | pages=104–108 }}</ref>

A Bowie knife appears on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the [[39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States)|39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]], headquartered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].

===Variations===
Among the many variations on Bowie knives (discussed or shown by Flayderman or Peterson) are Bowies with interchangeable blades, push daggers, double-ended Bowies, folding Bowies, Bowies with a cork screw or other accessories, Bowie bayonets, combination Bowie/pistols, a Bowie with a saw-toothed back and Confederate Bowies with D-guards. Some were works of fine art. A giant folding Bowie, almost {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length and weighing {{convert|34|lb|kg}} was made for presentation to an American congressman who ''offered'' to engage in a knife duel (a dispute between [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]] and [[John F. Potter]]). A few huge Bowies up to {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long were created for exhibition.

Over the years many knives have been called Bowie knives and the term has almost become a generic term for any large sheath knife. During the early days of the [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers carried immense knives called [[D-Guard Bowie knives]].<ref name =\"MC\"/>  Many of these knives could have qualified as short [[sword]]s and were often made from old saw or [[scythe]] blades.

The Bowie knife is sometimes confused with the \"[[Arkansas toothpick]],\" possibly due to the interchangeable use of the names \"Arkansas toothpick\", \"Bowie knife\", and \"Arkansas knife\" in the antebellum period.<ref name=ark/>  The Arkansas toothpick is essentially a heavy [[dagger]] with a straight {{convert|15|-|25|in|cm}} blade. While balanced and weighted for throwing, the toothpick can be used for thrusting and slashing. Although James Black is popularly credited with inventing the \"Arkansas Toothpick\", no firm evidence exists for this claim.<ref name=\"RJ\"/>

Knives made in [[Sheffield]], England, were quick to enter the market with \"Bowie Knives\" of a distinctive pattern that most modern users identify with the true form Bowie. The Sheffield pattern blade is thinner than the Black/Musso knives, while the false edge is often longer, with a more oblique and less pronounced clip edge.<ref name=\"MC\"/>  While the Bowie is often considered a uniquely American knife, most blades were produced in Sheffield England.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edmondson | first = J.

===Collecting===
During the late 19th and 20th centuries, the Bowie knife served usefully as a camp and hunting tool as well as a weapon, and is still popular with some hunters and trappers in the present day.<ref name=\"MC\"/>  However, as today's campers and backpackers generally rely on prepared lightweight foods, and have little or no use for a large knife as a weapon or for butchering wild game animals, the traditional Bowie pattern knife is today mostly purchased by collectors or edged weapon enthusiasts.<ref name =\"Miracle\">Miracle, Leonard, ''Complete Book of Camping'', HarperCollins (2000), {{ISBN|978-0-06-071230-3}}, p. 160.</ref>

===Portrayal in popular culture===
The Bowie knife has been present in popular culture throughout the ages, ranging from the days of the Western dime novels and pulps, to Literary Fiction such as the 1897 classic vampire novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by Irish author Bram Stoker. Despite the popular image of Count Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of the story, Dracula is actually killed by his heart being pierced by Quincey Morris's Bowie knife and his throat being sliced by Jonathan Harker's [[kukri]] knife. Bowie knives appeared in the classic works of Americans [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and [[Mark Twain]], Englishman [[Charles Dickens]], and Frenchman [[Jules Verne]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Flayderman | first = Norm | title = The Bowie knife : unsheathing an American legend | publisher = Andrew Mowbray | location = Lincoln, R.I. | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781931464123 | pages = 72–73}}</ref>

The Bowie knife has also appeared in television and cinema such as the largely fictional 1952 film ''[[The Iron Mistress]]'' (directed by Alan Ladd, and loosely based on the life of James Bowie) and the 1950s television series ''[[The Adventures of Jim Bowie]]''. At the end of [[John Ford]]’s film ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956), [[John Wayne]]’s character Ethan Edwards uses a Bowie knife to scalp the Comanche Indian chief 'Scar' he has been hunting throughout the film.

The Bowie knife was a staple in ''The Alamo'' movies of [[The Alamo (1960 film)|1960]] and [[The Alamo (2004 film)|2004]]; the first three Rambo movies, ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982), ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), and ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988); the film ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' (1986) and its sequel ''[[Crocodile Dundee II]]'' (1988); and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980).<ref name=\"HOF\">{{cite news |title = Bowie Inducted into the Hall of Fame| work = Blade Magazine| date = 1988-08-01}}</ref>

<blockquote>That if any person carrying any knife or weapon known as a Bowie knife ... or any knife or weapon that shall in form, shape, or size resemble a Bowie knife, on a sudden encounter, shall cut or stab another person with such knife or weapon, whether death ensues or not, such person so stabbing or cutting shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be confined in the jail and penitentiary house of this State, for a period of time not less than three years, nor more than fifteen years.<ref name=\"CRA\"/><ref>Cramer, pp. 111–112: So great was public pressure to clamp down on use of the Bowie knife that the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the law two years later (''Aymette v.

'''Pope Leo XIII''' ({{lang-it|Leone XIII}}; born '''Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi Pecci'''{{efn|{{IPAc-it|v|i|n|ˈ|c|E|n|z|o|_|gi|o|a|q|ˈ|ch|i|ː|n|o|_|r|a|ff|a|ˈ|E|ː|l|e|_|l|u|ˈ|i|ː|g|i|_|ˈ|p|e|cc|i|}}; English: '''Vincent Joachim Raphael Lewis Pecci'''}}; 2 March 1810 – 20 July 1903) was the visible head of the [[Catholic Church]] from 20 February 1878 to his death. He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].

He is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].

Leo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].

== Early life and education, 1810–1836 ==
[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]
Born in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.

In 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].

In 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.

==Provincial administrator, 1837–1843==
[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]
On 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />

The main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=31}}

Pecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=37}}

==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==
[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]
In 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.

On 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].

In 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=52}}

In Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>

==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846–1878==

===Papal assistant===
[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]
In 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>Kühne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.

===Provincial council===
Pecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.

===Charitable activities===
[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]
Pecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Pietà,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].

===Defending the papacy===
Pecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=105}}

===Organizing the First Vatican Council===
On 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.

During the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=129}}

In August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard. '' Life of Leo XIII'', Charles L. Webster & Company, New York, 1887]</ref>

===Papal conclave, 1878===
{{Main|Papal conclave, 1878}}
Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878,<ref name=Oreilly /> and during his closing years, the Liberal press had often insinuated that the [[Kingdom of Italy]] should take a hand in the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] and occupy the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the sudden death of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] (9 January 1878) distracted the government's attention.

In the conclave, the cardinals faced varied questions and discussed issues like [[church-state relations (Catholic Church)|church–state relations]] in Europe, specifically Italy, divisions in the church, and the status of the First Vatican Council. It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.

(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)

==Papacy, 1878–1903==
{{Social teachings of the popes}}

[[File:XIII.Leopápa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]

As soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.  When he firmly re-asserted the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrine that science and religion co-exist, he required the study of [[Thomas Aquinas]]<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |title=Aeterni Patris&nbsp;– On the Restoration of Christian Philosophy |publisher=Catholic forum |type=encyclical |date=4 August 1879 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225040233/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |archivedate=25 February 2007 }}.</ref> and opened the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to qualified researchers, among whom was the noted historian of the Papacy [[Ludwig von Pastor]]. He also re-founded the [[Vatican Observatory]]
\"so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |title=Ut Mysticam |language=Latin |date=14 March 1891}}.</ref>

Leo XIII was the first Pope of whose voice a [[sound recording]] was made. The recording can be found on a compact disc of [[Alessandro Moreschi]]'s singing; a recording of his praying of the [[Ave Maria (musical settings)|Ave Maria]] is available on the Web.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://archive.org/details/PopeLeoXIII1810-1903 |publisher=Archive |title=Pope Leo XIII, 1810–1910}}.</ref> He was also the first Pope to be filmed by a motion picture camera. He was filmed by its inventor, [[W. K. Dickson]], and blessed the camera while being filmed.<ref>{{Citation |title=Encyclopedia of early cinema |first=Richard |last=Abel |isbn=978-0-415-23440-5 |page=266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&pg=PA266|date=2004-08-01}}.</ref>

Leo XIII brought normality back to the Church after the tumultuous years of Pius IX. Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.

While Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.

Pope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>

Leo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

===Foreign relations===
[[File:The story of the greatest nations, from the dawn of history to the twentieth century - a comprehensive history, founded upon the leading authorities, including a complete chronology of the world, and (14775157511).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Depiction of Leo XIII's papal coronation – image circa 1900.]]

====Russia====
{{Main |Pope Leo XIII and Russia|Pope Leo XIII and Poland}}
Pope Leo XIII began his pontificate with a friendly letter to Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], in which he reminded the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] monarch of the millions of Catholics living in his empire who would like to be good Russian subjects if their dignity were respected.

After the assassination of Alexander II, the Pope sent a high ranking representative to the coronation of his successor. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was grateful and asked for all religious forces to unify. He asked the Pope to ensure that his bishops abstain from political [[agitator|agitation]]. Relations improved further, when Pope Leo XIII, due to Italian considerations, distanced the Vatican from the Rome-Vienna-Berlin alliance and helped to facilitate a rapprochement between Paris and St. Petersburg.

====Germany====
Under [[Otto von Bismarck]], the [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in Prussia led to significant restrictions on the Catholic Church in Imperial Germany, including the [[Jesuits Law (1872)|Jesuits Law]] of 1872. During Leo's papacy compromises were informally reached and the anti-Catholic attacks subsided.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald J. |last=Ross |title=The failure of Bismarck's Kulturkampf: Catholicism and state power in imperial Germany, 1871–1887 |year=1998 |location= Washington |publisher= Catholic University of America Press |isbn= 978-0-81320894-7}}</ref>

The [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] in Germany represented Catholic interests and was a positive force for social change. It was encouraged by Leo's support for social welfare legislation and the rights of working people. Leo's forward-looking approach encouraged Catholic Action in other European countries where the social teachings of the Church were incorporated into the agenda of Catholic parties, particularly the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties, which became an acceptable alternative to socialist parties. Leo's social teachings were reiterated throughout the 20th century by his successors.

In his ''Memoirs''<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywZoAAAAMAAJ&dq=kaiser+%22My+Memoirs |title=Memoirs |pp=204–07 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |last1=Emperor) |first1=William I.I. (German |year=1922}}</ref> [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] discussed the \"friendly, trustful relationship that existed between me and Pope Leo XIII.\" During Wilhelm's third visit to Leo: \"It was of interest to me that the Pope said on this occasion that Germany must be the sword of the Catholic Church. I remarked that the old Roman Empire of the German nation no longer existed, and that conditions had changed. But he adhered to his words.\"

====France====
Leo XIII was the first pope to come out strongly in favour of the [[French Republic]], upsetting many French [[monarchist]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1878/2/20/count-vincenzo-pecci-leo-xiii-elected-pope|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

====Italy====
In the light of a climate hostile to the Church, Leo continued the policies of Pius IX towards Italy, without major modifications.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=409}}  In his relations with the Italian state, Leo XIII continued the Papacy's self-imposed [[Prisoner in the Vatican|incarceration in the Vatican]] stance and continued to insist that Italian Catholics should not vote in Italian elections or hold elected office. In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}

====United Kingdom====
Among the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878. In the following year, on 12 May 1879, he raised to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] the convert clergyman [[John Henry Newman]],<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Martire |first=Egilberto |date=1951 |title=Enciclopedia Cattolica |trans-title=Catholic Encyclopedia |language=Italian|location=Firenze |publisher=Casa Editrice G. C. Sansoni |volume=7}}</ref>  who would eventually be [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2010 and [[canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Francis]] in 2019. In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=Sæpe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops. Of outstanding significance, not least for the English-speaking world, was Leo's encyclical ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'' on the invalidity of the Anglican orders, published in 1896.

====United States====
[[File:PapaleoXIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|In 1889, Pope Leo XIII authorized the founding of [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, D.C., and granted it Papal degrees in theology]]
The United States at many moments in time attracted the attention and admiration of Pope Leo. He confirmed the decrees of the [[Third Plenary Council of Baltimore]] (1884), and raised [[James Gibbons]], archbishop of that city, to the cardinalate in 1886.

On 10 April 1887, a pontifical charter from Pope Leo XIII founded The Catholic University of America, establishing the national university of the Catholic Church in the United States.

American newspapers criticized Pope Leo because they claimed that he was attempting to gain control of American public schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} One cartoonist drew Leo as a fox unable to reach grapes that were labeled for American schools; the caption read \"Sour grapes!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criaimages.com/detail.aspx?img=0000037708c|title=CRIA: Commercial Research Image Archives|first=CRIA|last=LLC|website=www.criaimages.com}}</ref>

====Brazil====
Pope Leo XIII is also remembered for the ''First Plenary Council of Latin America'' held at Rome in 1899, and his encyclical of 1888 to the bishops of [[Brazil]], ''[[In plurimis]]'', on the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]]. In 1897, he published the [[Apostolic Letter]] ''Trans Oceanum'', which dealt with the privileges and ecclesiastical structure of the Catholic Church in Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/apost_letters/documents/hf_l-xiii_apl_18970418_trans-oceanum_lt.html |language=Latin |trans-title=Over the Ocean, Apostolic letter on Latin American privileges |title=Trans Oceanum, Litterae apostolicae, De privilegiis Americae Latinae |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=Vatican |date=1897-04-18 |place=Rome, IT |accessdate= 23 June 2013}}</ref>

====Chile====
During the [[War of the Pacific]] he gave the papal blessing to the [[Chile]]an troops on the eve of the [[Battle of Chorrillos]] in January 1881; after the battle, in the resulting chaos, there was extensive looting in the city, both from Chilean troops as well as Peruvians, with the Chileans carrying many old Bibles to their churches.<ref>{{Citation |first=Tomas |last=Caivano |title=Historia de la guerra de América entre Chile, Perú y Bolivia |year=1907 |language=Spanish|trans-title=History of the American war between Chile, Peru and Bolivia}}.</ref> Despite this, one year later, the Chilean President [[Domingo Santa María]], member of the [[Liberal Party (Chile, 1849)|Liberal Party]] in defiance of the opposition, the fiercely catholic [[Conservative Party (Chile)|Conservative Party]], issued the ''Leyes Laicas'' (Laic Laws), which reduced the faculties of the Catholic Church over the State and Society, though it was not until 1925 when President [[Arturo Alessandri]], also from the Liberal Party separated the Church from the State.

====Evangelization====
Pope Leo XIII sanctioned the missions to eastern Africa beginning in 1884.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In 1879 Catholic missionaries associated with the [[White Fathers|White Father Congregation (Society of the Missionaries of Africa)]] came to Uganda and others went to Tanganyika (present day Tanzania) and Rwanda.
In 1887 he approved the foundation of [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo]] which was organized by the [[Bishop of Piacenza]], [[Giovanni Battista Scalabrini]]. The missionaries were sent to North and South America to do pastoral care for Italian immigrants.

===Theology===
{{Main|Theology of Pope Leo XIII}}
[[File:GiuseppePecciLeoXIII.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[Giuseppe Pecci]] in 1872. At the urgent requests of the [[College of Cardinals]], Leo XIII in 1879 elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, a [[Jesuit]] and prominent [[Thomist]] theologian, into their ranks.<ref>{{Citation |first=Benno |last=Kühne |title=Unser Heiliger Vater Papst Leo XIII in seinem Leben und wirken |place=Benzinger |publisher=Einsiedeln |year=1880 |page=247}}.</ref>]]
{{Further|List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}
The pontificate of Leo XIII was theologically influenced by the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–1870), which had ended only eight years earlier. Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev. Anthony |date=1992 |website= |publisher=TraditionalMass.org |access-date=29 September 2017 |quote=}}</ref>

Leo XIII also approved a number of Scapulars. In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>

====Thomism====
As pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism—the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas—as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.

Following this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.

====Consecrations====
[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863–1899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]
Pope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.

The encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.

====Scriptures====
In his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1–12}}.</ref>

====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====
Pope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"

====Theological research====
[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]
Leo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>

====Mariology====
{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}
His predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].

====Social teachings====
{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}

=====Church and state=====
Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=====''Rerum novarum''=====
[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1900]]
His encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].

===Canonizations and beatifications===

He also approved the cult of [[Cosmas of Aphrodisia]]. He also beatified several of the English martyrs in 1895.<ref>{{cite web|newspaper=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=2748 |title=St. Cosmas&nbsp;— Saints & Angels |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>

====Doctors of the Church====
Leo XIII named four individuals as [[Doctors of the Church]]:
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (1883)
* [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (1883)
* [[John of Damascus]] (1890)
* [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] (13 November 1899)

===Audiences===
[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|165px|left|In 1901, Pope Leo XIII welcomed Eugenio Pacelli, later [[Pope Pius XII]], on his first day of fifty-seven years of service in the Vatican (1901–1958).]]
One of the first audiences Leo XIII granted was to the professors and students of the [[Collegio Capranica]], where in the first row knelt in front of him a young seminarian, [[Giacomo Della Chiesa]], the future [[Pope Benedict XV]], who would reign from 1914 to 1922.

While on a pilgrimage with her father and sister in 1887, the future [[Saint Thérèse of Lisieux]] attended a general audience with Pope Leo XIII and asked him to allow her to enter the [[Carmelite order]]. Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Thérèse replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Thérèse (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15.

==Death==
[[File:TOMB LEO xiii.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The monument and tomb to Leo XIII in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.]]
Leo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903,<ref>John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 98.</ref> the longest-lived pope ever ({{as of|2020|lc=y}}). At the time of his death, Leo XIII was the second-longest reigning pope, exceeded only by his immediate predecessor, Pius IX.

[[Charles A. Finn]], a priest of the [[Archdiocese of Boston]] and at his own death the oldest priest in the United States, served as a mass officer at his funeral.<ref name=upi>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/03/08/Monsignor-Charles-A-Finn-the-oldest-Roman-Catholic-priest/8775384411600/ |title=Monsignor Charles A. Finn, the oldest Roman Catholic priest... |date=8 March 1982 |accessdate=30 January 2019 |publisher=UPI}}</ref> Leo XIII was entombed in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] only very briefly after his funeral, but was later moved instead to the very ancient [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]], his cathedral church as the Bishop of Rome, and a church in which he took a particular interest. He was moved there in late 1924.

'''Pope Leo XIII''' ({{lang-it|Leone XIII}}; born '''Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi Pecci'''{{efn|{{IPAc-it|v|i|n|ˈ|c|E|n|z|o|_|gi|o|a|q|ˈ|ch|i|ː|n|o|_|r|a|ff|a|ˈ|E|ː|l|e|_|l|u|ˈ|i|ː|g|i|_|ˈ|p|e|cc|i|}}; English: '''Vincent Joachim Raphael Lewis Pecci'''}}; 2 March 1810 – 20 July 1903) was head of the [[Catholic Church]] on Earth from 20 February 1878 to his death. He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].

He is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].

Leo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].

== Early life and education, 1810–1836 ==
[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]
Born in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.

In 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].

In 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.

==Provincial administrator, 1837–1843==
[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]
On 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />

The main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=31}}

Pecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=37}}

==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==
[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]
In 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.

On 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].

In 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=52}}

In Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>

==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846–1878==

===Papal assistant===
[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]
In 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>Kühne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.

===Provincial council===
Pecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.

===Charitable activities===
[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]
Pecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Pietà,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].

===Defending the papacy===
Pecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=105}}

===Organizing the First Vatican Council===
On 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.

During the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=129}}

In August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard. '' Life of Leo XIII'', Charles L. Webster & Company, New York, 1887]</ref>

===Papal conclave, 1878===
{{Main|Papal conclave, 1878}}
Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878,<ref name=Oreilly /> and during his closing years, the Liberal press had often insinuated that the [[Kingdom of Italy]] should take a hand in the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] and occupy the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the sudden death of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] (9 January 1878) distracted the government's attention.

In the conclave, the cardinals faced varied questions and discussed issues like [[church-state relations (Catholic Church)|church–state relations]] in Europe, specifically Italy, divisions in the church, and the status of the First Vatican Council. It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.

(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)

==Papacy, 1878–1903==

[[File:XIII.Leopápa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]

As soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.  When he firmly re-asserted the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrine that science and religion co-exist, he required the study of [[Thomas Aquinas]]<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |title=Aeterni Patris&nbsp;– On the Restoration of Christian Philosophy |publisher=Catholic forum |type=encyclical |date=4 August 1879 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225040233/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |archivedate=25 February 2007 }}.</ref> and opened the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to qualified researchers, among whom was the noted historian of the Papacy [[Ludwig von Pastor]]. He also re-founded the [[Vatican Observatory]]
\"so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |title=Ut Mysticam |language=Latin |date=14 March 1891}}.</ref>

Leo XIII was the first Pope of whose voice a [[sound recording]] was made. The recording can be found on a compact disc of [[Alessandro Moreschi]]'s singing; a recording of his praying of the [[Ave Maria (musical settings)|Ave Maria]] is available on the Web.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://archive.org/details/PopeLeoXIII1810-1903 |publisher=Archive |title=Pope Leo XIII, 1810–1910}}.</ref> He was also the first Pope to be filmed by a motion picture camera. He was filmed by its inventor, [[W. K. Dickson]], and blessed the camera while being filmed.<ref>{{Citation |title=Encyclopedia of early cinema |first=Richard |last=Abel |isbn=978-0-415-23440-5 |page=266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&pg=PA266|date=2004-08-01}}.</ref>

Leo XIII brought normality back to the Church after the tumultuous years of Pius IX. Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.

While Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.

Pope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>

Leo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

====Russia====
{{Main |Pope Leo XIII and Russia|Pope Leo XIII and Poland}}
Pope Leo XIII began his pontificate with a friendly letter to Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], in which he reminded the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] monarch of the millions of Catholics living in his empire who would like to be good Russian subjects if their dignity were respected.

After the assassination of Alexander II, the Pope sent a high ranking representative to the coronation of his successor. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was grateful and asked for all religious forces to unify. He asked the Pope to ensure that his bishops abstain from political [[agitator|agitation]]. Relations improved further, when Pope Leo XIII, due to Italian considerations, distanced the Vatican from the Rome-Vienna-Berlin alliance and helped to facilitate a rapprochement between Paris and St. Petersburg.

====Germany====
Under [[Otto von Bismarck]], the [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in Prussia led to significant restrictions on the Catholic Church in Imperial Germany, including the [[Jesuits Law (1872)|Jesuits Law]] of 1872. During Leo's papacy compromises were informally reached and the anti-Catholic attacks subsided.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald J. |last=Ross |title=The failure of Bismarck's Kulturkampf: Catholicism and state power in imperial Germany, 1871–1887 |year=1998 |location= Washington |publisher= Catholic University of America Press |isbn= 978-0-81320894-7}}</ref>

The [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] in Germany represented Catholic interests and was a positive force for social change. It was encouraged by Leo's support for social welfare legislation and the rights of working people. Leo's forward-looking approach encouraged Catholic Action in other European countries where the social teachings of the Church were incorporated into the agenda of Catholic parties, particularly the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties, which became an acceptable alternative to socialist parties. Leo's social teachings were reiterated throughout the 20th century by his successors.

In his ''Memoirs''<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywZoAAAAMAAJ&dq=kaiser+%22My+Memoirs |title=Memoirs |pp=204–07 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |last1=Emperor) |first1=William I.I. (German |year=1922}}</ref> [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] discussed the \"friendly, trustful relationship that existed between me and Pope Leo XIII.\" During Wilhelm's third visit to Leo: \"It was of interest to me that the Pope said on this occasion that Germany must be the sword of the Catholic Church. I remarked that the old Roman Empire of the German nation no longer existed, and that conditions had changed. But he adhered to his words.\"

====France====
Leo XIII was the first pope to come out strongly in favour of the [[French Republic]], upsetting many French [[monarchist]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1878/2/20/count-vincenzo-pecci-leo-xiii-elected-pope|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

====Italy====
In the light of a climate hostile to the Church, Leo continued the policies of Pius IX towards Italy, without major modifications.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=409}}  In his relations with the Italian state, Leo XIII continued the Papacy's self-imposed [[Prisoner in the Vatican|incarceration in the Vatican]] stance and continued to insist that Italian Catholics should not vote in Italian elections or hold elected office. In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}

====United Kingdom====
Among the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878. In the following year, on 12 May 1879, he raised to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] the convert clergyman [[John Henry Newman]],<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Martire |first=Egilberto |date=1951 |title=Enciclopedia Cattolica |trans-title=Catholic Encyclopedia |language=Italian|location=Firenze |publisher=Casa Editrice G. C. Sansoni |volume=7}}</ref>  who would eventually be [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2010 and [[canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Francis]] in 2019. In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=Sæpe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops. Of outstanding significance, not least for the English-speaking world, was Leo's encyclical ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'' on the invalidity of the Anglican orders, published in 1896.

====United States====
[[File:PapaleoXIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|In 1889, Pope Leo XIII authorized the founding of [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, D.C., and granted it Papal degrees in theology]]
The United States at many moments in time attracted the attention and admiration of Pope Leo. He confirmed the decrees of the [[Third Plenary Council of Baltimore]] (1884), and raised [[James Gibbons]], archbishop of that city, to the cardinalate in 1886.

On 10 April 1887, a pontifical charter from Pope Leo XIII founded The Catholic University of America, establishing the national university of the Catholic Church in the United States.

American newspapers criticized Pope Leo because they claimed that he was attempting to gain control of American public schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} One cartoonist drew Leo as a fox unable to reach grapes that were labeled for American schools; the caption read \"Sour grapes!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criaimages.com/detail.aspx?img=0000037708c|title=CRIA: Commercial Research Image Archives|first=CRIA|last=LLC|website=www.criaimages.com}}</ref>

====Brazil====
Pope Leo XIII is also remembered for the ''First Plenary Council of Latin America'' held at Rome in 1899, and his encyclical of 1888 to the bishops of [[Brazil]], ''[[In plurimis]]'', on the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]]. In 1897, he published the [[Apostolic Letter]] ''Trans Oceanum'', which dealt with the privileges and ecclesiastical structure of the Catholic Church in Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/apost_letters/documents/hf_l-xiii_apl_18970418_trans-oceanum_lt.html |language=Latin |trans-title=Over the Ocean, Apostolic letter on Latin American privileges |title=Trans Oceanum, Litterae apostolicae, De privilegiis Americae Latinae |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=Vatican |date=1897-04-18 |place=Rome, IT |accessdate= 23 June 2013}}</ref>

====Chile====
During the [[War of the Pacific]] he gave the papal blessing to the [[Chile]]an troops on the eve of the [[Battle of Chorrillos]] in January 1881; after the battle, in the resulting chaos, there was extensive looting in the city, both from Chilean troops as well as Peruvians, with the Chileans carrying many old Bibles to their churches.<ref>{{Citation |first=Tomas |last=Caivano |title=Historia de la guerra de América entre Chile, Perú y Bolivia |year=1907 |language=Spanish|trans-title=History of the American war between Chile, Peru and Bolivia}}.</ref> Despite this, one year later, the Chilean President [[Domingo Santa María]], member of the [[Liberal Party (Chile, 1849)|Liberal Party]] in defiance of the opposition, the fiercely catholic [[Conservative Party (Chile)|Conservative Party]], issued the ''Leyes Laicas'' (Laic Laws), which reduced the faculties of the Catholic Church over the State and Society, though it was not until 1925 when President [[Arturo Alessandri]], also from the Liberal Party separated the Church from the State.

====Evangelization====
Pope Leo XIII sanctioned the missions to eastern Africa beginning in 1884.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In 1879 Catholic missionaries associated with the [[White Fathers|White Father Congregation (Society of the Missionaries of Africa)]] came to Uganda and others went to Tanganyika (present day Tanzania) and Rwanda.
In 1887 he approved the foundation of [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo]] which was organized by the [[Bishop of Piacenza]], [[Giovanni Battista Scalabrini]]. The missionaries were sent to North and South America to do pastoral care for Italian immigrants.

===Theology===
{{Main|Theology of Pope Leo XIII}}
[[File:GiuseppePecciLeoXIII.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[Giuseppe Pecci]] in 1872. At the urgent requests of the [[College of Cardinals]], Leo XIII in 1879 elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, a [[Jesuit]] and prominent [[Thomist]] theologian, into their ranks.<ref>{{Citation |first=Benno |last=Kühne |title=Unser Heiliger Vater Papst Leo XIII in seinem Leben und wirken |place=Benzinger |publisher=Einsiedeln |year=1880 |page=247}}.</ref>]]
{{Further|List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}
The pontificate of Leo XIII was theologically influenced by the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–1870), which had ended only eight years earlier. Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev. Anthony |date=1992 |website= |publisher=TraditionalMass.org |access-date=29 September 2017 |quote=}}</ref>

Leo XIII also approved a number of Scapulars. In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>

====Thomism====
As pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism—the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas—as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.

Following this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.

====Consecrations====
[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863–1899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]
Pope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.

The encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.

====Scriptures====
In his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1–12}}.</ref>

====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====
Pope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"

====Theological research====
[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]
Leo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>

====Mariology====
{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}
His predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].

====Social teachings====
{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}

=====Church and state=====
Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=====''Rerum novarum''=====
[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1900]]
His encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].

===Canonizations and beatifications===

====Doctors of the Church====
Leo XIII named four individuals as [[Doctors of the Church]]:
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (1883)
* [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (1883)
* [[John of Damascus]] (1890)
* [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] (13 November 1899)

===Audiences===
[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|165px|left|In 1901, Pope Leo XIII welcomed Eugenio Pacelli, later [[Pope Pius XII]], on his first day of fifty-seven years of service in the Vatican (1901–1958).]]
One of the first audiences Leo XIII granted was to the professors and students of the [[Collegio Capranica]], where in the first row knelt in front of him a young seminarian, [[Giacomo Della Chiesa]], the future [[Pope Benedict XV]], who would reign from 1914 to 1922.

While on a pilgrimage with her father and sister in 1887, the future [[Saint Thérèse of Lisieux]] attended a general audience with Pope Leo XIII and asked him to allow her to enter the [[Carmelite order]]. Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Thérèse replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Thérèse (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15.

==Death==
[[File:TOMB LEO xiii.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The monument and tomb to Leo XIII in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.]]
Leo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903,<ref>John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 98.</ref> the longest-lived pope ever ({{as of|2020|lc=y}}). At the time of his death, Leo XIII was the second-longest reigning pope, exceeded only by his immediate predecessor, Pius IX.

[[Charles A. Finn]], a priest of the [[Archdiocese of Boston]] and at his own death the oldest priest in the United States, served as a mass officer at his funeral.<ref name=upi>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/03/08/Monsignor-Charles-A-Finn-the-oldest-Roman-Catholic-priest/8775384411600/ |title=Monsignor Charles A. Finn, the oldest Roman Catholic priest... |date=8 March 1982 |accessdate=30 January 2019 |publisher=UPI}}</ref> Leo XIII was entombed in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] only very briefly after his funeral, but was later moved instead to the very ancient [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]], his cathedral church as the Bishop of Rome, and a church in which he took a particular interest. He was moved there in late 1924.

'''Pope Leo XIII''' ({{lang-it|Leone XIII}}; born '''Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi Pecci'''{{efn|{{IPAc-it|v|i|n|ˈ|c|E|n|z|o|_|gi|o|a|q|ˈ|ch|i|ː|n|o|_|r|a|ff|a|ˈ|E|ː|l|e|_|l|u|ˈ|i|ː|g|i|_|ˈ|p|e|cc|i|}}; English: '''Vincent Joachim Raphael Lewis Pecci'''}}; 2 March 1810 – 20 July 1903) was head of the [[Catholic Church]] from 20 February 1878 to his death. He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].

He is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].

Leo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].

== Early life and education, 1810–1836 ==
[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]
Born in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.

In 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].

In 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.

==Provincial administrator, 1837–1843==
[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]
On 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />

The main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=31}}

Pecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=37}}

==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==
[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]
In 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.

On 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].

In 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=52}}

In Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>

==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846–1878==

===Papal assistant===
[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]
In 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>Kühne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.

===Provincial council===
Pecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.

===Charitable activities===
[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]
Pecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Pietà,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].

===Defending the papacy===
Pecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=105}}

===Organizing the First Vatican Council===
On 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.

During the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=129}}

In August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard. '' Life of Leo XIII'', Charles L. Webster & Company, New York, 1887]</ref>

===Papal conclave, 1878===
{{Main|Papal conclave, 1878}}
Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878,<ref name=Oreilly /> and during his closing years, the Liberal press had often insinuated that the [[Kingdom of Italy]] should take a hand in the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] and occupy the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the sudden death of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] (9 January 1878) distracted the government's attention.

In the conclave, the cardinals faced varied questions and discussed issues like [[church-state relations (Catholic Church)|church–state relations]] in Europe, specifically Italy, divisions in the church, and the status of the First Vatican Council. It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.

(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)

==Papacy, 1878–1903==

[[File:XIII.Leopápa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]

As soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.  When he firmly re-asserted the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrine that science and religion co-exist, he required the study of [[Thomas Aquinas]]<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |title=Aeterni Patris&nbsp;– On the Restoration of Christian Philosophy |publisher=Catholic forum |type=encyclical |date=4 August 1879 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225040233/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |archivedate=25 February 2007 }}.</ref> and opened the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to qualified researchers, among whom was the noted historian of the Papacy [[Ludwig von Pastor]]. He also re-founded the [[Vatican Observatory]]
\"so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |title=Ut Mysticam |language=Latin |date=14 March 1891}}.</ref>

Leo XIII was the first Pope of whose voice a [[sound recording]] was made. The recording can be found on a compact disc of [[Alessandro Moreschi]]'s singing; a recording of his praying of the [[Ave Maria (musical settings)|Ave Maria]] is available on the Web.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://archive.org/details/PopeLeoXIII1810-1903 |publisher=Archive |title=Pope Leo XIII, 1810–1910}}.</ref> He was also the first Pope to be filmed by a motion picture camera. He was filmed by its inventor, [[W. K. Dickson]], and blessed the camera while being filmed.<ref>{{Citation |title=Encyclopedia of early cinema |first=Richard |last=Abel |isbn=978-0-415-23440-5 |page=266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&pg=PA266|date=2004-08-01}}.</ref>

Leo XIII brought normality back to the Church after the tumultuous years of Pius IX. Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.

While Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.

Pope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>

Leo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

====Russia====
{{Main |Pope Leo XIII and Russia|Pope Leo XIII and Poland}}
Pope Leo XIII began his pontificate with a friendly letter to Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], in which he reminded the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] monarch of the millions of Catholics living in his empire who would like to be good Russian subjects if their dignity were respected.

After the assassination of Alexander II, the Pope sent a high ranking representative to the coronation of his successor. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was grateful and asked for all religious forces to unify. He asked the Pope to ensure that his bishops abstain from political [[agitator|agitation]]. Relations improved further, when Pope Leo XIII, due to Italian considerations, distanced the Vatican from the Rome-Vienna-Berlin alliance and helped to facilitate a rapprochement between Paris and St. Petersburg.

====Germany====
Under [[Otto von Bismarck]], the [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in Prussia led to significant restrictions on the Catholic Church in Imperial Germany, including the [[Jesuits Law (1872)|Jesuits Law]] of 1872. During Leo's papacy compromises were informally reached and the anti-Catholic attacks subsided.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald J. |last=Ross |title=The failure of Bismarck's Kulturkampf: Catholicism and state power in imperial Germany, 1871–1887 |year=1998 |location= Washington |publisher= Catholic University of America Press |isbn= 978-0-81320894-7}}</ref>

The [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] in Germany represented Catholic interests and was a positive force for social change. It was encouraged by Leo's support for social welfare legislation and the rights of working people. Leo's forward-looking approach encouraged Catholic Action in other European countries where the social teachings of the Church were incorporated into the agenda of Catholic parties, particularly the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties, which became an acceptable alternative to socialist parties. Leo's social teachings were reiterated throughout the 20th century by his successors.

In his ''Memoirs''<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywZoAAAAMAAJ&dq=kaiser+%22My+Memoirs |title=Memoirs |pp=204–07 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |last1=Emperor) |first1=William I.I. (German |year=1922}}</ref> [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] discussed the \"friendly, trustful relationship that existed between me and Pope Leo XIII.\" During Wilhelm's third visit to Leo: \"It was of interest to me that the Pope said on this occasion that Germany must be the sword of the Catholic Church. I remarked that the old Roman Empire of the German nation no longer existed, and that conditions had changed. But he adhered to his words.\"

====France====
Leo XIII was the first pope to come out strongly in favour of the [[French Republic]], upsetting many French [[monarchist]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1878/2/20/count-vincenzo-pecci-leo-xiii-elected-pope|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

====Italy====
In the light of a climate hostile to the Church, Leo continued the policies of Pius IX towards Italy, without major modifications.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=409}}  In his relations with the Italian state, Leo XIII continued the Papacy's self-imposed [[Prisoner in the Vatican|incarceration in the Vatican]] stance and continued to insist that Italian Catholics should not vote in Italian elections or hold elected office. In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}

====United Kingdom====
Among the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878. In the following year, on 12 May 1879, he raised to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] the convert clergyman [[John Henry Newman]],<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Martire |first=Egilberto |date=1951 |title=Enciclopedia Cattolica |trans-title=Catholic Encyclopedia |language=Italian|location=Firenze |publisher=Casa Editrice G. C. Sansoni |volume=7}}</ref>  who would eventually be [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2010 and [[canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Francis]] in 2019. In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=Sæpe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops. Of outstanding significance, not least for the English-speaking world, was Leo's encyclical ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'' on the invalidity of the Anglican orders, published in 1896.

====United States====
[[File:PapaleoXIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|In 1889, Pope Leo XIII authorized the founding of [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, D.C., and granted it Papal degrees in theology]]
The United States at many moments in time attracted the attention and admiration of Pope Leo. He confirmed the decrees of the [[Third Plenary Council of Baltimore]] (1884), and raised [[James Gibbons]], archbishop of that city, to the cardinalate in 1886.

On 10 April 1887, a pontifical charter from Pope Leo XIII founded The Catholic University of America, establishing the national university of the Catholic Church in the United States.

American newspapers criticized Pope Leo because they claimed that he was attempting to gain control of American public schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} One cartoonist drew Leo as a fox unable to reach grapes that were labeled for American schools; the caption read \"Sour grapes!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criaimages.com/detail.aspx?img=0000037708c|title=CRIA: Commercial Research Image Archives|first=CRIA|last=LLC|website=www.criaimages.com}}</ref>

====Brazil====
Pope Leo XIII is also remembered for the ''First Plenary Council of Latin America'' held at Rome in 1899, and his encyclical of 1888 to the bishops of [[Brazil]], ''[[In plurimis]]'', on the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]]. In 1897, he published the [[Apostolic Letter]] ''Trans Oceanum'', which dealt with the privileges and ecclesiastical structure of the Catholic Church in Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/apost_letters/documents/hf_l-xiii_apl_18970418_trans-oceanum_lt.html |language=Latin |trans-title=Over the Ocean, Apostolic letter on Latin American privileges |title=Trans Oceanum, Litterae apostolicae, De privilegiis Americae Latinae |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=Vatican |date=1897-04-18 |place=Rome, IT |accessdate= 23 June 2013}}</ref>

====Chile====
During the [[War of the Pacific]] he gave the papal blessing to the [[Chile]]an troops on the eve of the [[Battle of Chorrillos]] in January 1881; after the battle, in the resulting chaos, there was extensive looting in the city, both from Chilean troops as well as Peruvians, with the Chileans carrying many old Bibles to their churches.<ref>{{Citation |first=Tomas |last=Caivano |title=Historia de la guerra de América entre Chile, Perú y Bolivia |year=1907 |language=Spanish|trans-title=History of the American war between Chile, Peru and Bolivia}}.</ref> Despite this, one year later, the Chilean President [[Domingo Santa María]], member of the [[Liberal Party (Chile, 1849)|Liberal Party]] in defiance of the opposition, the fiercely catholic [[Conservative Party (Chile)|Conservative Party]], issued the ''Leyes Laicas'' (Laic Laws), which reduced the faculties of the Catholic Church over the State and Society, though it was not until 1925 when President [[Arturo Alessandri]], also from the Liberal Party separated the Church from the State.

====Evangelization====
Pope Leo XIII sanctioned the missions to eastern Africa beginning in 1884.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In 1879 Catholic missionaries associated with the [[White Fathers|White Father Congregation (Society of the Missionaries of Africa)]] came to Uganda and others went to Tanganyika (present day Tanzania) and Rwanda.
In 1887 he approved the foundation of [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo]] which was organized by the [[Bishop of Piacenza]], [[Giovanni Battista Scalabrini]]. The missionaries were sent to North and South America to do pastoral care for Italian immigrants.

At the urgent requests of the [[College of Cardinals]], Leo XIII in 1879 elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, a [[Jesuit]] and prominent [[Thomist]] theologian, into their ranks.<ref>{{Citation |first=Benno |last=Kühne |title=Unser Heiliger Vater Papst Leo XIII in seinem Leben und wirken |place=Benzinger |publisher=Einsiedeln |year=1880 |page=247}}.</ref>]]
{{Further|List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}
The pontificate of Leo XIII was theologically influenced by the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–1870), which had ended only eight years earlier. Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev. Anthony |date=1992 |website= |publisher=TraditionalMass.org |access-date=29 September 2017 |quote=}}</ref>

Leo XIII also approved a number of Scapulars. In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>

====Thomism====
As pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism—the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas—as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.

Following this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.

====Consecrations====
[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863–1899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]
Pope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.

The encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.

====Scriptures====
In his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1–12}}.</ref>

====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====
Pope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"

====Theological research====
[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]
Leo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>

====Mariology====
{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}
His predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].

====Social teachings====
{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}

=====Church and state=====
Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=====''Rerum novarum''=====
[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1900]]
His encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].

===Canonizations and beatifications===

====Doctors of the Church====
Leo XIII named four individuals as [[Doctors of the Church]]:
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (1883)
* [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (1883)
* [[John of Damascus]] (1890)
* [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] (13 November 1899)

===Audiences===
[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|165px|left|In 1901, Pope Leo XIII welcomed Eugenio Pacelli, later [[Pope Pius XII]], on his first day of fifty-seven years of service in the Vatican (1901–1958).]]
One of the first audiences Leo XIII granted was to the professors and students of the [[Collegio Capranica]], where in the first row knelt in front of him a young seminarian, [[Giacomo Della Chiesa]], the future [[Pope Benedict XV]], who would reign from 1914 to 1922.

While on a pilgrimage with her father and sister in 1887, the future [[Saint Thérèse of Lisieux]] attended a general audience with Pope Leo XIII and asked him to allow her to enter the [[Carmelite order]]. Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Thérèse replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Thérèse (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15.

==Death==
[[File:TOMB LEO xiii.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The monument and tomb to Leo XIII in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.]]
Leo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903,<ref>John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 98.</ref> the longest-lived pope ever ({{as of|2020|lc=y}}). At the time of his death, Leo XIII was the second-longest reigning pope, exceeded only by his immediate predecessor, Pius IX.

[[Charles A. Finn]], a priest of the [[Archdiocese of Boston]] and at his own death the oldest priest in the United States, served as a mass officer at his funeral.<ref name=upi>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/03/08/Monsignor-Charles-A-Finn-the-oldest-Roman-Catholic-priest/8775384411600/ |title=Monsignor Charles A. Finn, the oldest Roman Catholic priest... |date=8 March 1982 |accessdate=30 January 2019 |publisher=UPI}}</ref> Leo XIII was entombed in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] only very briefly after his funeral, but was later moved instead to the very ancient [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]], his cathedral church as the Bishop of Rome, and a church in which he took a particular interest. He was moved there in late 1924.

'''Pope Leo XIII''' ({{lang-it|Leone XIII}}; born '''Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi Pecci'''{{efn|{{IPAc-it|v|i|n|ˈ|c|E|n|z|o|_|gi|o|a|q|ˈ|ch|i|ː|n|o|_|r|a|ff|a|ˈ|E|ː|l|e|_|l|u|ˈ|i|ː|g|i|_|ˈ|p|e|cc|i|}}; English: '''Vincent Joachim Raphael Lewis Pecci'''}}; 2 March 1810 – 20 July 1903) was the visible head of the [[Catholic Church]] from 20 February 1878 to his death. He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].

He is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].

Leo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].

== Early life and education, 1810–1836 ==
[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]
Born in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.

In 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].

In 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.

==Provincial administrator, 1837–1843==
[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]
On 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />

The main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=31}}

Pecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=37}}

==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==
[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]
In 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.

On 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].

In 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=52}}

In Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>

==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846–1878==

===Papal assistant===
[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]
In 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>Kühne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.

===Provincial council===
Pecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.

===Charitable activities===
[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]
Pecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Pietà,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].

===Defending the papacy===
Pecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=105}}

===Organizing the First Vatican Council===
On 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.

During the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|Kühne|1880|p=129}}

In August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard. '' Life of Leo XIII'', Charles L. Webster & Company, New York, 1887]</ref>

===Papal conclave, 1878===
{{Main|Papal conclave, 1878}}
Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878,<ref name=Oreilly /> and during his closing years, the Liberal press had often insinuated that the [[Kingdom of Italy]] should take a hand in the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] and occupy the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the sudden death of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] (9 January 1878) distracted the government's attention.

In the conclave, the cardinals faced varied questions and discussed issues like [[church-state relations (Catholic Church)|church–state relations]] in Europe, specifically Italy, divisions in the church, and the status of the First Vatican Council. It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.

(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)

==Papacy, 1878–1903==

[[File:XIII.Leopápa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]

As soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.  When he firmly re-asserted the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrine that science and religion co-exist, he required the study of [[Thomas Aquinas]]<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |title=Aeterni Patris&nbsp;– On the Restoration of Christian Philosophy |publisher=Catholic forum |type=encyclical |date=4 August 1879 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225040233/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |archivedate=25 February 2007 }}.</ref> and opened the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to qualified researchers, among whom was the noted historian of the Papacy [[Ludwig von Pastor]]. He also re-founded the [[Vatican Observatory]]
\"so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |title=Ut Mysticam |language=Latin |date=14 March 1891}}.</ref>

Leo XIII was the first Pope of whose voice a [[sound recording]] was made. The recording can be found on a compact disc of [[Alessandro Moreschi]]'s singing; a recording of his praying of the [[Ave Maria (musical settings)|Ave Maria]] is available on the Web.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://archive.org/details/PopeLeoXIII1810-1903 |publisher=Archive |title=Pope Leo XIII, 1810–1910}}.</ref> He was also the first Pope to be filmed by a motion picture camera. He was filmed by its inventor, [[W. K. Dickson]], and blessed the camera while being filmed.<ref>{{Citation |title=Encyclopedia of early cinema |first=Richard |last=Abel |isbn=978-0-415-23440-5 |page=266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&pg=PA266|date=2004-08-01}}.</ref>

Leo XIII brought normality back to the Church after the tumultuous years of Pius IX. Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.

While Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.

Pope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>

Leo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

====Russia====
{{Main |Pope Leo XIII and Russia|Pope Leo XIII and Poland}}
Pope Leo XIII began his pontificate with a friendly letter to Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], in which he reminded the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] monarch of the millions of Catholics living in his empire who would like to be good Russian subjects if their dignity were respected.

After the assassination of Alexander II, the Pope sent a high ranking representative to the coronation of his successor. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was grateful and asked for all religious forces to unify. He asked the Pope to ensure that his bishops abstain from political [[agitator|agitation]]. Relations improved further, when Pope Leo XIII, due to Italian considerations, distanced the Vatican from the Rome-Vienna-Berlin alliance and helped to facilitate a rapprochement between Paris and St. Petersburg.

====Germany====
Under [[Otto von Bismarck]], the [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in Prussia led to significant restrictions on the Catholic Church in Imperial Germany, including the [[Jesuits Law (1872)|Jesuits Law]] of 1872. During Leo's papacy compromises were informally reached and the anti-Catholic attacks subsided.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald J. |last=Ross |title=The failure of Bismarck's Kulturkampf: Catholicism and state power in imperial Germany, 1871–1887 |year=1998 |location= Washington |publisher= Catholic University of America Press |isbn= 978-0-81320894-7}}</ref>

The [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] in Germany represented Catholic interests and was a positive force for social change. It was encouraged by Leo's support for social welfare legislation and the rights of working people. Leo's forward-looking approach encouraged Catholic Action in other European countries where the social teachings of the Church were incorporated into the agenda of Catholic parties, particularly the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties, which became an acceptable alternative to socialist parties. Leo's social teachings were reiterated throughout the 20th century by his successors.

In his ''Memoirs''<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywZoAAAAMAAJ&dq=kaiser+%22My+Memoirs |title=Memoirs |pp=204–07 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |last1=Emperor) |first1=William I.I. (German |year=1922}}</ref> [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] discussed the \"friendly, trustful relationship that existed between me and Pope Leo XIII.\" During Wilhelm's third visit to Leo: \"It was of interest to me that the Pope said on this occasion that Germany must be the sword of the Catholic Church. I remarked that the old Roman Empire of the German nation no longer existed, and that conditions had changed. But he adhered to his words.\"

====France====
Leo XIII was the first pope to come out strongly in favour of the [[French Republic]], upsetting many French [[monarchist]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1878/2/20/count-vincenzo-pecci-leo-xiii-elected-pope|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

====Italy====
In the light of a climate hostile to the Church, Leo continued the policies of Pius IX towards Italy, without major modifications.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=409}}  In his relations with the Italian state, Leo XIII continued the Papacy's self-imposed [[Prisoner in the Vatican|incarceration in the Vatican]] stance and continued to insist that Italian Catholics should not vote in Italian elections or hold elected office. In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}

====United Kingdom====
Among the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878. In the following year, on 12 May 1879, he raised to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] the convert clergyman [[John Henry Newman]],<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Martire |first=Egilberto |date=1951 |title=Enciclopedia Cattolica |trans-title=Catholic Encyclopedia |language=Italian|location=Firenze |publisher=Casa Editrice G. C. Sansoni |volume=7}}</ref>  who would eventually be [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2010 and [[canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Francis]] in 2019. In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=Sæpe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops. Of outstanding significance, not least for the English-speaking world, was Leo's encyclical ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'' on the invalidity of the Anglican orders, published in 1896.

====United States====
[[File:PapaleoXIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|In 1889, Pope Leo XIII authorized the founding of [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, D.C., and granted it Papal degrees in theology]]
The United States at many moments in time attracted the attention and admiration of Pope Leo. He confirmed the decrees of the [[Third Plenary Council of Baltimore]] (1884), and raised [[James Gibbons]], archbishop of that city, to the cardinalate in 1886.

On 10 April 1887, a pontifical charter from Pope Leo XIII founded The Catholic University of America, establishing the national university of the Catholic Church in the United States.

American newspapers criticized Pope Leo because they claimed that he was attempting to gain control of American public schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} One cartoonist drew Leo as a fox unable to reach grapes that were labeled for American schools; the caption read \"Sour grapes!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criaimages.com/detail.aspx?img=0000037708c|title=CRIA: Commercial Research Image Archives|first=CRIA|last=LLC|website=www.criaimages.com}}</ref>

====Brazil====
Pope Leo XIII is also remembered for the ''First Plenary Council of Latin America'' held at Rome in 1899, and his encyclical of 1888 to the bishops of [[Brazil]], ''[[In plurimis]]'', on the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]]. In 1897, he published the [[Apostolic Letter]] ''Trans Oceanum'', which dealt with the privileges and ecclesiastical structure of the Catholic Church in Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/apost_letters/documents/hf_l-xiii_apl_18970418_trans-oceanum_lt.html |language=Latin |trans-title=Over the Ocean, Apostolic letter on Latin American privileges |title=Trans Oceanum, Litterae apostolicae, De privilegiis Americae Latinae |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=Vatican |date=1897-04-18 |place=Rome, IT |accessdate= 23 June 2013}}</ref>

====Chile====
During the [[War of the Pacific]] he gave the papal blessing to the [[Chile]]an troops on the eve of the [[Battle of Chorrillos]] in January 1881; after the battle, in the resulting chaos, there was extensive looting in the city, both from Chilean troops as well as Peruvians, with the Chileans carrying many old Bibles to their churches.<ref>{{Citation |first=Tomas |last=Caivano |title=Historia de la guerra de América entre Chile, Perú y Bolivia |year=1907 |language=Spanish|trans-title=History of the American war between Chile, Peru and Bolivia}}.</ref> Despite this, one year later, the Chilean President [[Domingo Santa María]], member of the [[Liberal Party (Chile, 1849)|Liberal Party]] in defiance of the opposition, the fiercely catholic [[Conservative Party (Chile)|Conservative Party]], issued the ''Leyes Laicas'' (Laic Laws), which reduced the faculties of the Catholic Church over the State and Society, though it was not until 1925 when President [[Arturo Alessandri]], also from the Liberal Party separated the Church from the State.

====Evangelization====
Pope Leo XIII sanctioned the missions to eastern Africa beginning in 1884.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In 1879 Catholic missionaries associated with the [[White Fathers|White Father Congregation (Society of the Missionaries of Africa)]] came to Uganda and others went to Tanganyika (present day Tanzania) and Rwanda.
In 1887 he approved the foundation of [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo]] which was organized by the [[Bishop of Piacenza]], [[Giovanni Battista Scalabrini]]. The missionaries were sent to North and South America to do pastoral care for Italian immigrants.

===Theology===
{{Main|Theology of Pope Leo XIII}}
[[File:GiuseppePecciLeoXIII.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[Giuseppe Pecci]] in 1872. At the urgent requests of the [[College of Cardinals]], Leo XIII in 1879 elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, a [[Jesuit]] and prominent [[Thomist]] theologian, into their ranks.<ref>{{Citation |first=Benno |last=Kühne |title=Unser Heiliger Vater Papst Leo XIII in seinem Leben und wirken |place=Benzinger |publisher=Einsiedeln |year=1880 |page=247}}.</ref>]]
{{Further|List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}
The pontificate of Leo XIII was theologically influenced by the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–1870), which had ended only eight years earlier. Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev. Anthony |date=1992 |website= |publisher=TraditionalMass.org |access-date=29 September 2017 |quote=}}</ref>

Leo XIII also approved a number of Scapulars. In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>

====Thomism====
As pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism—the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas—as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.

Following this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.

====Consecrations====
[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863–1899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]
Pope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.

The encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.

====Scriptures====
In his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1–12}}.</ref>

====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====
Pope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"

====Theological research====
[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]
Leo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>

====Mariology====
{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}
His predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].

====Social teachings====
{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}

=====Church and state=====
Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=====''Rerum novarum''=====
[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1900]]
His encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].

====Doctors of the Church====
Leo XIII named four individuals as [[Doctors of the Church]]:
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (1883)
* [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (1883)
* [[John of Damascus]] (1890)
* [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] (13 November 1899)

===Audiences===
[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|165px|left|In 1901, Pope Leo XIII welcomed Eugenio Pacelli, later [[Pope Pius XII]], on his first day of fifty-seven years of service in the Vatican (1901–1958).]]
One of the first audiences Leo XIII granted was to the professors and students of the [[Collegio Capranica]], where in the first row knelt in front of him a young seminarian, [[Giacomo Della Chiesa]], the future [[Pope Benedict XV]], who would reign from 1914 to 1922.

While on a pilgrimage with her father and sister in 1887, the future [[Saint Thérèse of Lisieux]] attended a general audience with Pope Leo XIII and asked him to allow her to enter the [[Carmelite order]]. Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Thérèse replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Thérèse (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15.

==Death==
[[File:TOMB LEO xiii.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The monument and tomb to Leo XIII in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.]]
Leo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903,<ref>John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 98.</ref> the longest-lived pope ever ({{as of|2020|lc=y}}). At the time of his death, Leo XIII was the second-longest reigning pope, exceeded only by his immediate predecessor, Pius IX.

[[Charles A. Finn]], a priest of the [[Archdiocese of Boston]] and at his own death the oldest priest in the United States, served as a mass officer at his funeral.<ref name=upi>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/03/08/Monsignor-Charles-A-Finn-the-oldest-Roman-Catholic-priest/8775384411600/ |title=Monsignor Charles A. Finn, the oldest Roman Catholic priest... |date=8 March 1982 |accessdate=30 January 2019 |publisher=UPI}}</ref> Leo XIII was entombed in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] only very briefly after his funeral, but was later moved instead to the very ancient [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]], his cathedral church as the Bishop of Rome, and a church in which he took a particular interest. He was moved there in late 1924.

'''Samba''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈsɐ̃bɐ|-|Br-Samba.ogg}}) is a Brazilian [[music genre]] and [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|dance style]], with its roots in Africa via the West African slave trade and African religious traditions, particularly of Angola and the Congo, through the [[samba de roda]] genre of the northeastern Brazilian state of [[Bahia]], from which it derived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelanguagejournal.com/2012/02/samba-and-frenetic-rhythm-of-brazils.html|title=Samba and the Frenetic Rhythm of Brazil's Carnival|website=www.thelanguagejournal.com}}</ref> Although there were various forms of samba in Brazil with popular rhythms originated from African drumming and the African structures of polyrhythm of Beat and Off-Beat, Time-Line-Pattern and the elementary pulse, that are performed by different instruments of the ''bateria'' of the samba schools of the famous S''amba-Enredo'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=O Samba Enredo das Escolas de Samba do Rio de Janeiro; Dicionário do Samba Enredo e das Escolas de Samba; As Dicas do Cartola|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba Enredo|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> that has its origins in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

Samba is recognized around the world as a symbol of [[Brazil]] and the [[Brazilian Carnival]].

The modern samba that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century is predominantly in a 2/4 time signature varied with the conscious use of a sung chorus to a [[batucada]] rhythm, with various stanzas of declaratory verses. Traditionally, the samba is played by strings ([[cavaquinho]] and various types of guitar) and various percussion instruments such as [[tamborim]]. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the [[Second World War]] and the cultural impact of [[US music]] post-war, samba began to use [[trombone]]s, trumpets, [[choro]]s,{{clarification|date=February 2020}} [[flute]]s, and [[clarinet]]s.<ref>{{cite web |date=2017 |url=http://www.jazzaspensnowmass.org/the-history-of-samba-at-the-jas-cafe-corner_blog_8124.html  |title = The History of Samba at the JAS Cafe Corner}}</ref>

In addition to distinct rhythms and meters, samba brings a whole historical culture of food, varied dances (miudinho, coco, samba de roda, and pernada), parties, clothes such as linen shirts, and the [[Naïve art|Naif painting]] of established names such as [[Nelson Sargento]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], and [[Heitor dos Prazeres]]. Anonymous community artists, including painters, sculptors, designers, and stylists, make the clothes, costumes, carnival floats, and cars, opening the doors of schools of samba. There is also a great tradition of ballroom samba in Brazil, with many styles. Samba de Gafieira is the style more famous in Rio de Janeiro, where common people used to go to the gafieira{{define}} parties since the 1930s, and where the moves and identity of this dance emerged, getting more and more different from its African, European, and Cuban{{explain|date=July 2019}} origins and influences.

The National Samba Day is celebrated on December 2. The date was established at the initiative of Luis Monteiro da Costa, an alderman of [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]], in honor of [[Ary Barroso]]. He composed \"''Na Baixa do sapateiro''\" even though he had never been in Bahia. Thus 2 December marked the first visit of Ary Barroso to Salvador. Initially, this day was celebrated only in Salvador, but eventually it turned into a national holiday.

Samba is a local style in [[Southeastern Brazil]] and [[Northeast Brazil]], especially in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]], [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]] and [[Recife]]. Its importance as Brazil's national music transcends region, however; [[samba schools]], samba musicians, and carnival organizations centered on the performance of samba exist in every region of the country, even though other musical styles prevail in various regions (for instance, in [[Southern Brazil]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West Brazil]], and all of the Brazilian countryside, [[música sertaneja]], music of the ''[[sertão]]'', or Brazilian country music, is the most popular style).<ref name=\"Música-Sertaneja-CRAVO-ALBIN\">[http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/musica-sertaneja/dados-artisticos Música Sertaneja] – Dicionário Cravo Albin da Música Popular Brasileira</ref>

One of the oldest records of the word samba appeared in [[Pernambuco]] magazine's ''O carapuceiro'', dated February 1838, when Father Miguel Lopes Gama of Sacramento wrote against what he called \"the samba d'almocreve\" – not referring to the future musical genre, but a kind of merriment (dance drama) popular for black people of that time. According to Hiram Araújo da Costa, over the centuries, the festival of dances of slaves in Bahia were called samba.<ref>{{citation | author=Suzy Klein | title=Brasil, Brasil - Samba to Bossa Nova | publisher= BBC | year=2007 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008byj6| author-link=Suzy Klein }}</ref>

In the middle of the 19th century, the word samba defined different types of music made by [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]] when conducted by different types of [[Batuque (music)|Batuque]], but it assumed its own characteristics in each [[Brazilian state]], not only by the diversity of tribes for slaves, but also the peculiarity of each region in which they were settlers. Some of these popular dances were known as [[Baião (music)|Baião]], [[Bochinche]], [[Candombe]] ([[Candomblé]]), [[Catêrêtê]], [[Caxambú]], [[Choradinho]], Côco-inchádo, [[Cocumbí]], [[Corta Jaca (dance)|Córta-jáca]], [[Cururú]], [[Furrundú]], [[Jongo]], [[Lundu (dance)|Lundú]], [[Maracatu|Maracatú]], [[Maxixe (dance)|Maxíxe]], [[Quimbête]], [[São-Gonçalo]], [[Saramba]]; not to mention the many varieties of the Portuguese [[Fandango]], and the Indio dance [[Puracé]].<ref>{{citation | author=Visconde de Beaurepaire-Rohan | title=Diccionario de vocabulos Brazileiros | publisher=Imprensa nacional | year=1889 | url=https://archive.org/details/diccionariodevo00rohagoog| author-link=Henrique Pedro Carlos de Beaurepaire-Rohan }}</ref>

In [[Argentina]], there is a dance called \"[[Zamba (artform)|zamba]]\", a name which seems to share etymological origins with the samba, but the dance itself is quite different.

===Samba-enredo===<!--copied section-->
'''Samba-enredo''' or '''samba de enredo''' is a subgenre of samba, performed by a [[samba school]] (or ''escola de samba'') for the festivities of [[Brazilian Carnival]]. \"Samba-enredo\" translates literally in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] a samba-song, which is thematically bonded to the selected special theme (Enredo) of its samba school and narrates the story, which it told by the samba schools, in a lyrical form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=O Samba Enredo das Escolas de Samba do Carnaval|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba Enredo|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Each samba school performs one song in the Carnaval parade. A new song must be written each year for each school; they must be on Brazilian topics. The Carnaval parade is among other things a samba competition, with judges, who rank the new sambas according to their perceived merit.

Being by definition topical, ''sambas-enredo'' are seldom performed outside of the Carnaval environment.

For each samba school, choosing the following year's samba-enredo is a long process. Well in advance of the Carnaval parade, each samba school holds a contest for writing the song. The song is written by samba composers from within the school itself (\"Ala dos Compositores\"), or sometimes from outside composers, normally in \"''parcerias''\" (partnerships). Each school receives many—sometimes hundreds—songs, sometimes hundreds of them, each hoping to be the next samba-enredo for that year. The samba-enredo is written by these numerous composers mentioned above only after the Carnival Art Director, or \"Carnavalesco\", officially publishes the [[samba school]]'s parade theme synopsis for the year. After a careful explanation of the parade-theme, many times done by the Carnival Art Director himself, composers may ask questions in order to clarify the synopsis, so they can start writing the samba-enredos.

[[File:HK TST night 柏麗購物大道 Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard 巴西 Brasil 森巴舞娘 Samba female dancers Nov-2010 02.JPG|thumb|Samba dancer]]
The schools select their Samba Campeão within a long process of elimination, called concurso de Samba-Enredo, Eliminatórias or also Disputa de Samba. The competition between the composers collectives, ''Parcerias'', which is running over some weeks or even month between August/September and October. It ends up after with somewhere between three to four sambas, which are competing in the great ''Final do Samba''. The winner finally becomes the samba schools hymn of the year.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The phenomenon of composer´s competitions at the Great Samba-Schools from Rio de Janeiro. Composers in the middle of a musical competition and a performative event|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|publisher=Klaus Näumann, Thomas Nußbaumer u.a.|year=2018|isbn=978-3-96233-070-5|location=München|pages=213}}</ref> Around this time, the finalist sambas-enredo are played with music and are voted on by the leaders of the samba school and the ''Carnavalesco''—the artistic director of the school for Carnaval. After months of deliberation, the new samba-enredo is chosen and becomes the voice of the samba school for the next year's Carnaval. The most important night in this process, is called the \"final de samba\", or samba final, when the samba school decides between two or three samba-enredos. At the end of the process, the winning samba-enredo is selected, and it is this song that is sung during the school's parade in the [[sambadrome]]. This process normally happens in Brazil from August until November, and today is highly professionalized, with samba-composers hiring fans, producing CDs, banners, and throwing parties to promote their samba-enredo. The final chosen song, today, is also uploaded on the school's Youtube and Facebook pages to reach even more fans.

It is important to note that the samba-enredo is one of the criteria used by the Judging committee to decide who is the winner of the Carnaval parade competition. The samba-enredo must be well sung by the samba school's ''puxador'' (or singer) or the school will lose points. While the puxador sings, everyone marching in the Carnaval parade sings the samba-enredo along with him, and [[harmony]] is another judging criterion.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Batuque.jpg|thumb|The [[Batuque (music)|Batuque]] practiced in Brazil of the 19th century, Lemar Mckoy in a painting by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]]]]
Although samba exists throughout Brazil  – especially in the states of [[Bahia]], [[Maranhão]], [[Minas Gerais]], and [[São Paulo]] – in the form of various popular rhythms and dances that originated from the regional [[batuque (music)|batuque]] of the eastern Brazilian state of [[Bahia]], a music form from Cape Verde, samba is frequently identified as a musical expression of urban [[Rio de Janeiro]], where it developed during the first years of the 20th century. Early styles of samba - and specifically [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|samba de roda]] - are traced back to the Recôncavo region of [[Bahia]] during the 17th century, and the informal dancing following a candomblé ceremony. It was in Rio de Janeiro that the dance practiced by former slaves, who migrated from Bahia came into contact with and incorporated other genres played in the city (such as the [[polka]], the [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]], the [[lundu (dance)|lundu]], and the [[xote]]), acquiring a completely unique character and creating the ''samba [[carioca]] urbana'' ([[samba school]])<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/> and the ''Carnavalesco,'' the artistic director of a samba school, who takes over an important part within the process of the creation of the new theme and within the conception of its presentation, designes all ''fantasias'' and ''alegorias'' and realizes the Tira-Dúvida with the composers of the competing sambas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Dicionário do Samba Enredo e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Samba schools are large organizations of up to 5,000 people which compete annually in the [[Carnival]] with thematic floats, elaborate costumes, and original music.

During the first decade of the 20th century, some songs under the name of samba were recorded, but these recordings did not achieve great popularity. However, in 1917, \"''Pelo Telefone''\" (\"By Telephone\") was recorded,<ref name=samba1>[http://www.brasilcultura.com.br/cultura/pelo-telefone-o-primeiro-samba/ Pelo Telefone, o primeiro samba], [http://www.revivendomusicas.com.br/produto_detalhe.asp?id=356 CD reissue]</ref> and it is considered the first true samba. The song was claimed to be authored by Ernesto dos Santos, best known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Donga (musician)|2=pt|3=Donga (músico)|4=de|5=Donga (Musiker)|preserve=1}}, with co-composition attributed to Mauro de Almeida, a well-known [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] columnist. Actually, \"Pelo Telefone\" was created by a collective of musicians who participated in celebrations at the house of [[Tia Ciata]] (Aunt Ciata). It was eventually registered by Donga and the Almeida National Library.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

\"''Pelo Telefone''\" was the first composition to achieve great success with the style of samba and to contribute to the dissemination and popularization of the genre. From that moment on, samba started to spread across the country, initially associated with Carnival and then developing its own place in the music market. There were many composers, including [[Heitor dos Prazeres]], [[João da Bahiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Sinhô]], but the sambas of these composers were \"amaxixados\" (a mix of [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]]), known as sambas-maxixes.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

The contours of the modern samba came only at the end of the 1920s, from the innovations of a group of composers of carnival \"blocks\" (groups) in the neighborhoods of Estácio de Sá and Osvaldo Cruz, and the hills of Mangueira, Salgueiro, and São Carlos. Since then, there have been many great names in samba, such as [[Ismael Silva]], [[Cartola]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ataulfo Alves]], [[Wilson Batista]], [[Geraldo Pereira (musician)|Geraldo Pereira]], [[Zé Kéti]], [[Candeia]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Elton Medeiros]], [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], and many others.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

As the samba consolidated as an urban and modern expression, it began to be played on radio stations, spreading across the hills and neighborhoods to the affluent southern areas of Rio de Janeiro. Initially viewed with prejudice and discrimination because it had black roots, the samba, because of its hypnotic rhythms and melodic intonations in addition to its playful lyrics, eventually conquered the white middle class as well. Other musical genres derived from samba, such as [[samba-canção]], [[partido alto]], [[samba-enredo]], [[samba de gafieira]], [[samba de breque]], [[bossa nova]], [[samba-rock]], and [[pagode]], have all earned names for themselves.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

The samba is frequently associated abroad with [[Association football|football]] and Carnaval. This history began with the international success of [[Aquarela do Brasil]], by Ary Barroso, followed by [[Carmen Miranda]] (supported by [[Getúlio Vargas]] government and the US [[Good Neighbor policy]]), which led samba to the United States. [[Bossa nova]] finally entered the country into the world of samba music. Brazilian percussionist and studio musician [[Paulinho Da Costa]], currently based in Los Angeles, incorporates the rhythms and instrumentation of the samba into the albums of hundreds of American, European and Japanese artists — including producer [[Quincy Jones]], jazz performer [[Dizzy Gillespie]], pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] and vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/free-ride-mw0000102458/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Free Ride|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Quincy|date= 2002|title= Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones|url= https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233|location= |publisher= Three Rivers Press|page= [https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233 233]|isbn= 978-0767905107|url-access= registration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Off the Wall|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/till-i-loved-you-mw0000197648/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Till I Loved You|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>

The success of the samba in Europe and Japan only confirms its ability to win fans, regardless of their language. Currently, there are hundreds of [[samba schools]] on European soil and scattered among countries like Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Already in Japan, the records invest heavily in the launch of former sambistas' set of discs, which eventually created a market composed solely of catalogs of Japanese record labels.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

=== Favela and the Tias from Bahia  ===

From the second half of the 19th century onward, as blacks, mestizas, and ex-soldiers of the [[War of Canudos]] in Rio de Janeiro came from various parts of Brazil (mainly Bahia) and settled in the vicinity of Morro da Conceição, Pedra do Sal, Praça Mauá, Praça Onze, Cidade Nova, Saúde, and Zona Portuária. These stands form poor communities that these people called the [[favela]]s (later the term became synonymous with the irregular buildings of the poor).

These communities would be the scene of a significant part of Brazilian [[black people|black culture]], particularly with respect to [[Candomblé]] and ''samba amaxixado'' at that time. Among the early highlights were the musician and dancer Hilário Jovino Ferreira—responsible for the founding of several blocks of [[afoxé]] and Carnival's ranchos—and ''Tias Baianas'', a term given to the female descendants of Bahian slaves.

Thus, the samba and musical genre was born in the houses of ''Tias Baianas'' (Bahian aunts) in the beginning of the 20th century, as a descendant of the style [[lundu (dance)|lundu]] of the candomblé de terreiro parties between [[umbigada]] (Samba) and [[capoeira]]'s pernadas, marked in [[pandeiro]], [[prato-e-faca]] (plate-and-knife) and in the ''palmas'', hand claps. The most famous of them is ''Tia Ciata'': Her House, situated at Rio´s central Region of Praça Onze, was one of the most popular places to meet, sing and dance and compose together. But not just that: It was also known as a place, where the immigrants from Bahia practiced religious rituals and ceremonies of Candomblé together in the hidden backyards, that where utilized as ''Terreiros''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Uma história do Samba; Dicionário do Samba e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> There are some controversies about the word ''samba-raiado'', one of the first appointments to the samba. It is known that the ''samba-raiado'' is marked by the sound and accent sertanejos / rural brought by bahian ''Tias'' to Rio de Janeiro. According to João da Baiana, the ''samba-raiado'' was the same as ''[[Chula (music)|chula]] raiada'' or [[Partido alto|samba de partido-alto]]. For the sambist Caninha, this was the first name would have heard at the home of Tia Dadá. At the same time, there were the ''samba-corrido'', a line that had more work together with the rural Bahian accent, and the samba-chulado, a more rhyming and melodic style that characterized the urban samba carioca.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

By the 1870s, Republican propagandists were attempting to prohibit samba on the pretext that folklorist dances shamed Brazil's national image. It would take the edict of a federal administration to halt the persecution of neighborhood samba groups and to recognize officially their parades. Later, the views of anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, and Getrllio Vargas, who became Brazil's new populist president in 1930, provided the country with fresh perspectives on racial mixing. Under Vargas, samba schools and carnaval parades were supported by the state and quickly established themselves all over Brazil. Samba significantly benefited from these political efforts to create a homogeneous national culture. While certain types of music suggested different racial or class origins, samba dissipated social antagonisms and helped unify a society that varied in its origins, appearance, and ways of living and thinking. Samba's triumph over the airwaves allowed it to penetrate all sectors of Brazilian society.<ref>Gilman, B., \"The Politics of Samba.\" Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 2001:2(2). http://journal.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2.2-Gilman.pdf accessed 26-4-2014.</ref>

According to anthropologist Hermano Vianna, configuring Samba as a symbol of Brazilianness was possible thanks to the cultural exchange between the working classes and intellectual elite. He cites a guitar meeting between anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, the historian Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, promoter and journalist Prudente de Moraes Neto, the classical composer Villa Lobos and pianist Lucio Gallet, all representative of the intellectual and cultural elite of white origin on the one hand; and Pixinguinha musician and composers / samba Donga and Patrick Teixeira, from the popular and crossbred layers on the other, saying how the occasion marked the meeting of two different or even opposing groups of Brazilian society.<ref>Vianna H., \"The Mystery of Samba: Popular Music and National Identity in Brazil\" (trans. Chasteen J), University of North Carolina Press 1999.</ref>

=== Scenes in Bahia and São Paulo ===
[[File:Пандейру и каквако.jpg|right|thumb|Pandeiro and cavaco, the nucleus of common samba instrumentation]]

The urban carioca samba is the anchor of 20th century ''\"Brazilian samba\"'' par excellence. However, before this type of samba was to consolidate as the ''\"national samba\"'' in Brazil, there were traditional forms of sambas in Bahia and [[São Paulo]].

The rural Bahia samba acquired additional names as choreographic variations – for example, the  ''\"samba-de-chave\"'', where the soloist dancer faking looking ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'' in the middle of a key, and when found, was replaced.{{clarify|date=November 2010}} The poetic structure of Bahian samba followed the way [[call-and-response]]—composed of a single verse, a solo, followed by another, and repeated by the chorus of dancers as the falderal. With no chorus, the samba is called ''samba-corrido'', which is an uncommon variant. The [[chant]]s were taken by one singer, one of the musicians, or soloist dancer. Another peculiarity of Bahian samba was a form of competition that dances sometimes presented: it was a dispute between participants to see who performed better. Besides the [[umbigada]], common to all the bahianian samba, the Bahia presented three basic steps: ''[[corta Jaca (samba step)|corta-a-jaca]]'', ''separa-o-visgo'', and ''apanha-o-bag''. There is also another choreographic element danced by women: the ''miudinho'' (this also appeared in São Paulo, as dance solo in the center of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]''). The instruments of the Bahian samba were [[pandeiro]]s, [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], guitars, and sometimes the [[castanets]] and [[berimbau]]s.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

In São Paulo state, samba became the domain of blacks and [[caboclo]]s. In rural areas, samba can occur without the traditional umbigada. There are also other choreographic variations—the dancers may be placed in rows with men on one side and women on another. The instruments of the samba paulista were [[viola]]s and [[pandeiro]]s. It is possible that the early provision of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'', in Goiás, has been modified by the influence of quadrilha or cateretê. According to historian Luís da Câmara Cascudo, it is possible to observe the influence of city in the samba, by the fact that it is also danced by pair connections.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

One of the most noticeable groups of São Paulo's samba, Demônios da Garoa (Drizzle's Demons), had a strong link with Adoniran Barbosa, who composed their songs. Songs like \"Samba do Arnesto\" and \"Saudosa Maloca\" became legendary, recognized as \"the real Samba Paulistano\". The group is still active, but with a different lineup. In 2000, one of their most famous songs, \"Trem das Onze\", was elected as an official symbol of the city of São Paulo.

=== First decades of the 20th century ===

==== \"Pelo Telefone\" ====

Tia Ciata, grandmother of the composer [[Bucy Moreira]], was responsible for the sedimentation of samba carioca. According to the [[folklore]] of that time, for a samba musician to achieve success, he would have to pass the house of Tia Ciata and be approved on the ''rodas de samba''. Many compositions were created and sung in improvisation, where the samba ''Pelo Telefone'' (from Donga and Mauro de Almeida), samba for which there were also many other versions, but to come to the history of samba,  Pelo Telefone was the first recorded Samba, in 1917

Meanwhile, other recordings have been done as samba before ''Pelo Telefone'', as this composition was done by double Donga / Mauro de Almeida, who is regarded as a founder of the genre. Still, the song is written and discussed, and its proximity to the [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe]] made it finally be designated samba-maxixe. This section was influenced by [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe dance]] and basically played the piano—unlike the Rio samba played in the Morros hills—and the composer has musician Sinhô, self-titled ''o rei do samba'' (\"the king of Samba\") which with other pioneers such as Heitor dos Prazeres and Caninha, lay the first foundations of the musical genre.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>

==== Turma do Estácio ====

The growing shantytowns ([[favela]]s) in the hills of suburban Rio would become the home of new musical talents. Almost simultaneously, the ''samba carioca'', which was born in the city center, would climb the slopes of the hills and spread outside the periphery, to the point that, over time, it came to be identified as ''samba de morro'' (samba from the hills).

At the end of the 1920s, the carnival samba of blocks of the districts [[Estácio, Rio de Janeiro|Estácio de Sá]] and [[Oswaldo Cruz (Rio de Janeiro)|Oswaldo Cruz]] was born, and in the hills of [[Mangueira]], Salgueiro, and São Carlos, there were innovations in rhythmic samba that persist until the present day. This group, the ''Turma do Estácio'', from which would arise ''Deixa Falar'', was the first samba school in Brazil. Formed by some composers in the neighborhood of Estácio, including Alcebíades Barcellos (aka Bide) Armando Marçal, [[Ismael Silva]], Nilton Bastos and the more \"[[malandro]]s\" such as Baiaco, Brancura, Mano Edgar, Mano Rubem, the ''\"Turma do Estácio\"'' marked the history of the Brazilian samba by injecting more pace to the genre one performed, which has the endorsement of the youth's middle class, as the ex-student of law [[Ary Barroso]] and former student of medicine [[Noel Rosa]].<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>

Initially a \"[[:pt:rancho carnavalesco]]\", then a [[Carnival block]], and finally a samba school, the ''Deixa Falar'' was the first to Rio Carnival parade in the sound of an orchestra made up of percussion [[surdo]]s, [[tambourine]]s, and [[cuíca]]s, who joined [[pandeiro]] and [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]]. This group was instrumental and is called ''bateria'', and it lends itself to the monitoring of a type of samba that was quite different from those of Donga, Sinhô, and [[Pixinguinha]]. The samba of Estácio de Sá signed up quickly as the samba carioca par excellence.

The ''Turma do Estácio'' has made the appropriate rhythmic samba were so it could be accompanied in the carnival's parade, thus distancing the progress ''samba-amaxixado'' of composers such as Sinhô. Moreover, its ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]s'' of samba were attended by composers from other Rio hills, as [[Cartola]], [[Carlos Cachaça]], and then [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], e Geraldo Pereira, Paulo da Portela, Alcides Malandro Histórico, Manacéia, Chico Santana, and others. Accompanied by a pandeiro, a tambourine, a cuíca and a surdo, they created and spread the samba-de-morro.

=== Popularization in the 1930s and 1940s ===
[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|Portuguese Brazilian singer [[Carmen Miranda]] helped popularize samba internationally.]]

After the founding of ''\"Deixa Falar\"'', the phenomenon of the samba schools took over the scene and helped boost Rio's samba subgenera of [[Partido Alto]], singing and challenging in ''candomblé terreiros'' the [[samba-enredo]].

From the 1930s, the popularization of radio in Brazil helped to spread the samba across the country, mainly the subgenres ''samba-canção'' and ''samba-exaltação''. The ''samba-canção'' was released in 1928 with the recording \"Ai, yo-yo\" by Aracy Cortes. Also known as \"samba half of the year\", the ''samba-canção'' became established in the next decade. It was a slow and rhythmic samba music and had an emphasis on melody and generally easy acceptance. This aspect was later influenced by the rhythms of foreigners, first by foxtrot in the 1940s and then [[bolero]] the 1950s. The most famous composers were [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Lamartine Babo]], Braguinha (also known as João de Barro), and [[Ataulfo Alves]]. Other practitioners of this style were Antonio Maria, Custódio Mesquita, [[Dolores Duran]], Fernando Lobo, Ismael Neto, Lupicínio Rodrigues, Batatinha, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]] (this latter by sharply satirical doses{{clarify|date=November 2010}}).<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/><ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>

The ideology of [[Getúlio Vargas]]'s Estado Novo changed the scene of the samba. With ''[[Aquarela do Brasil]]'', composed by [[Ary Barroso]] and recorded by [[Francisco Alves]] in 1939, the ''samba-exaltação'' become the first success abroad. This kind of samba was characterized by extensive compositions of melody and patriotic verses. [[Carmen Miranda]] popularized samba internationally through her Hollywood films.

With the support of the Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas, the samba won status as the \"official music\" of Brazil. With this status of national identity came the recognition of the intellectual and classical composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], who arranged a recording with the maestro [[Leopold Stokowski]] in 1940, which involved [[Cartola]], Donga, [[João da Baiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Zé da Zilda]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

Also in the 1940s, there arose a new crop of artists: Francisco Alves, Mário Reis, Orlando Silva, Silvio Caldas, [[Aracy de Almeida]], [[Dalva de Oliveira]], and [[Elizeth Cardoso]], among others. Others such as Assis Valente, Ataulfo Alves, [[Dorival Caymmi]], [[Herivelto Martins]], [[Pedro Caetano]], and [[Synval Silva]] led the samba to the music industry.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>

=== New beat in the 1950s: the Bossa Nova ===
[[File:João Gilberto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[João Gilberto]], [[bossa nova]] pioneer]]

A movement was born in the southern area of Rio de Janeiro, strongly influenced by [[jazz]], marking the history of samba and [[Brazilian popular music]] in the 1950s. The [[bossa nova]] emerged at the end of that decade, with an original rhythmic accent which divided the phrasing of the samba and added influences of [[impressionist music]] and jazz and a different style of singing which was both intimate and gentle. After precursors such as [[Johnny Alf]], [[João Donato]], and musicians like [[Luis Bonfá]] and Garoto, this subgenre was inaugurated by [[João Gilberto]], [[Tom Jobim]], and [[Vinicius de Moraes]]. It then had a generation of disciples and followers including [[Carlos Lyra]], [[Roberto Menescal]], [[Durval Ferreira]], and groups like [[Tamba Trio]], [[Bossa 3]], [[Zimbo Trio]], and [[The Cariocas]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

The [[sambalanço]] also began at the end of the 1950s. It was a branch of the popular bossa nova (most appreciated by the middle class) which also mingled samba rhythms and American jazz. Sambalanço was often found at suburban dances of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. This style was developed by artists such as [[Bebeto]], [[Bedeu]], [[Scotland 7]], [[Djalma Ferreira]], [[the Daydreams]], [[Dhema]], [[Ed Lincoln]], [[Elza Soares]], and [[Miltinho]], among others. In the 21st century, groups like [[Funk Como Le Gusta]] and [[Clube do Balanço]] continue to keep this subgenre alive.

=== Rediscovering of samba's roots in the 1960s and 1970s ===
In the 1960s, Brazil became politically divided with the arrival of a [[military dictatorship]], and the leftist musicians of bossa nova started to gather attention to the music made in the ''[[favela]]s''. Many popular artists were discovered at this time. Musicians like [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], [[Velha Guarda da Portela]], [[Zé Keti]], and [[Clementina de Jesus]] recorded their first albums during this time.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

In the 1970s, samba returned strongly to the air waves with composers and singers like [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], [[Clara Nunes]], and [[Beth Carvalho]] dominating the hit parade. Great samba lyricists like [[Paulo César Pinheiro]] (especially in the praised partnership with [[João Nogueira]]) and [[Aldir Blanc]] started to appear around that time.

With bossa nova, samba is further away from its popular roots. The influence of jazz deepened, and techniques have been incorporated from classical music. From a festival in [[Carnegie Hall]] of New York, in 1962, the bossa nova reached worldwide success. But over the 1960s and 1970s, many artists who emerged—like [[Chico Buarque]], Billy Blanco, [[Martinho da Vila]], and [[Paulinho da Viola]]—advocated the return of the samba beat in its traditional form. They also wanted veterans like [[Candeia]], [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], and [[Zé Kéti]] to return. In the early 1960s, the \"Movement for Revitalization of Traditional Samba\", promoted by Center for Popular Culture, started in partnership with the Brazilian National Union of Students. During the 1960s, some samba groups appeared and were formed by previous experiences with the world of samba and songs recorded by great names of Brazilian music. Among them were The Cinco Crioulos, The Voz do Morro, Mensageiros do Samba, and The Cinco Só.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

Outside the main scene of the Brazilian Popular Music festivals, the sambists founded the Bienal do Samba in the late 1960s, and it became the space for the big names of the genre and followers. Even in the final decade, the ''samba-empolgação'' (samba-excitement) of carnival blocks ''Bafo da Onça'', ''Cacique de Ramos,'' and ''Boêmios de Irajá'' came into being.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

==== Fusion: the samba-funk ====
Also in the 1960s came the [[Samba rock|samba funk]]. The samba-funk emerged at the end of the 1960s with pianist [[Dom Salvador]] and his group, which merged the samba with American [[funk]], which was then newly arrived in the Brazil. With the departure of Dom Salvador to the United States, the band broke up, but at the beginning of the 1970s, some ex-members, including Luiz Carlos, José Carlos Barroso, and Oberdan joined Christovao Bastos, Jamil Joanes, Cláudio Stevenson and Lúcio da Silva  to form [[Banda Black Rio]]. The new group has deepened the work of Don Salvador in the double mixture of the bar with the Brazilian samba funk of the American Quaternary, based on the dynamics of implementation, driven by drums and bass. Even after the Banda Black Rio in the 1980s, British disc jockeys began to play the group's work. It was rediscovered throughout Europe, but mainly in UK and Germany.<ref name=\"samba1\" />

==== Partido-Alto for the masses ====
At the turn of the 1960s to the 1970s, the young [[Martinho da Vila]] would give a new face to the traditional sambas-enredo established by authors such as [[Silas de Oliveira]] and Mano Decio da Viola, compressing them and expanding its potential in the music market. Martin popularized the style of the [[Partido alto]] with songs like \"Casa de Bamba\" and \"Pequeno Burguês\" and launched his first album in 1969.

Although the term ''partido alto'' originally arose at the beginning of the 1900s to describe instrumental music, the term came to be used to signify a type of samba which is characterized by a highly percussive beat of [[pandeiro]], using the palm of the hand in the center of the instrument in place. The harmony of Partido alto is always higher in pitch, usually played by a set of percussion instruments (usually surdo, pandeiro, and tambourine) and accompanied by a [[cavaquinho]] and/or a guitar.

Also in that decade, some popular singers and composers appeared in the samba, including [[Alcione Nazaré|Alcione]], [[Beth Carvalho]], and [[Clara Nunes]]. As highlighted in [[city of São Paulo]], Geraldo Filme was one of the leading names in samba paulistano, next to Germano Mathias, Osvaldinho of Cuíca, Tobias da Vai-Vai, Aldo Bueno, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]].

=== 1980s until 1990s ===
[[File:Zeca Pagodinho.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Zeca Pagodinho]], a popular contemporary sambist]]

In the early 1980s, after having been eclipsed by the popularity of [[disco]] and [[Brazilian rock]], Samba reappeared in the media with a musical movement created in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. It was the ''[[pagode]]'', a renewed samba, with new instruments like the [[banjo (samba)|banjo]] and the [[tan-tan]]. It also had a new language that reflected the way that many people actually spoke by including heavy ''gíria'', or [[slang]]. The most popular artists were [[Zeca Pagodinho]], [[Almir Guineto]], [[Grupo Fundo de Quintal]], [[Jorge Aragão]], and [[Jovelina Pérola Negra]].<ref name=\"cliquemusic/pagode\">{{cite web| title = Pagode, O samba que vem do fundo do quintal|url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20 |accessdate=23 August 2008 }} ({{Google translation|en|pt|http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20}}</ref>

In 1995, the world saw one of the most popular [[Pagode]] groups, the [[Gera Samba]], later renamed to ''[[É o Tchan]]'', come out from Savador. This group created the most sexual dance of the Pagode during the 1990s, mixing a lot of Axé music in it. Some groups like [[Patrulha do Samba]] and [[Harmonia do Samba]], also mixed in a bit of Axé. Samba, as a result, morphed during this period, embracing types of music that were growing popular in the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Hip hop music|rap]], [[reggae]], and rock. Examples of Samba fusions with popular Caribbean music is samba-rap, [[samba-rock]], and [[samba-reggae]], all of which were efforts to not only entertain, but also to unify all Blacks throughout the Americas culturally and politically via song. In other words, samba-rap and the like often carried lyrics that encouraged Black pride, and spoke out against social injustice.<ref>\"The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music\" ''Latin American Music Review'' 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref> Samba, however, is not accepted by all as the national music of Brazil, or as a valuable art form. Light-skinned \"upper-class\" Brazilians often associated Samba with dark-skinned blacks because of its arrival from West Africa. As a result, there are some light-skinned Brazilians who claim that samba is the music of low-class, dark-skinned Brazilians and, therefore, is a \"thing of bums and bandits\".<ref>R.J.'s Gringo Guides, [http://www.gringoguides.com/sambaracism.shtml \"The Roots of Racism in Samba in Brazil\"], retrieved 14 Feb 2008.</ref>

Samba continued to act as a unifying agent during the 1990s, when Rio stood as a national Brazilian symbol. Even though it was not the capital city, Rio acted as a Brazilian unifier, and the fact that samba originated in Rio helped the unification process. In 1994, the [[FIFA World Cup]] had its own samba composed for the occasion, the \"Copa 94\". The [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], in which samba played a major cultural role, holds the record for highest attendance in World Cup history. Samba is thought to be able to unify because individuals participate in it regardless of social or ethnic group. Today, samba is viewed as perhaps the only uniting factor in a country fragmented by political division.<ref>[[Behague, Gerard]]. \"Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music ).\" Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref>

The Afro-Brazilians played a significant role in the development of the samba over time. This change in the samba was an integral part of Brazilian nationalism, which was referred to as \"Brazilianism\".
<blockquote>
\"What appears to be new is the local response to that flow, in that instead of simply assimilating outside influences into a local genre or movement, the presence of foreign genres is acknowledged
as part of the local scene: samba-rock, samba-reggae, samba-rap.
But this acknowledgment does not imply mere imitation of the foreign
models or, for that matter, passive consumption by national audiences.\" – [[Gerard Béhague]], ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology.'' Pg. 84
</blockquote>

===Samba in the 21st century===
[[File:Marcelo D2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marcelo D2]] frequently mixes [[hip hop]] with samba.]]
From the year 2000 onwards, there were some artists who were looking to reconnect the most popular traditions of samba. The cases of Marquinhos of Oswaldo Cruz and Teresa Cristina, were, among others, the ones that contributed to the revitalization of the region of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro. In São Paulo, samba resumed the tradition with concerts in Sesc Pompéia Club and with the work of several groups, including the group Quinteto em Branco e Preto which developed the event \"Pagode da Vela\" (\"Pagoda of Sail\"). These all helped to attract many artists from Rio de Janeiro, which has established residence in neighborhoods of the capital paulistana.

Samba was also mixed with [[drum and bass]] leading to the foundation of [[Sambass]]. Despite the evolution during the decades, Samba still remains a traditional dance, and cannot be considered a sport.

In 2004, the minister of culture [[Gilberto Gil]] submitted to [[Unesco]] an application for declaring samba as a Cultural Heritage of Humanity in the category \"Intangible Goods\" by the Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage. In 2005 the samba-de-roda of Baiano Recôncavo was proclaimed part of the Heritage of Humanity by Unesco, in the category of \"Oral and intangible expressions\". The Samba is often performed on different dance shows, such as Strictly Come Dancing.

'''Samba''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈsɐ̃bɐ|-|Br-Samba.ogg}}) is a Brazilian [[music genre]] and [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|dance style]], with its roots in Africa via the West African slave trade and African religious traditions, particularly of Angola and the Congo, through the [[samba de roda]] genre of the northeastern Brazilian state of [[Bahia]], from which it derived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelanguagejournal.com/2012/02/samba-and-frenetic-rhythm-of-brazils.html|title=Samba and the Frenetic Rhythm of Brazil's Carnival|website=www.thelanguagejournal.com}}</ref> Although there were various forms of samba in Brazil with popular rhythms originated from African drumming and the African structures of polyrhythm of Beat and Off-Beat, Time-Line-Pattern and the elementary pulse, that are performed by different instruments of the ''bateria'' of the samba schools of the famous S''amba-Enredo'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=O Samba Enredo das Escolas de Samba do Rio de Janeiro; Dicionário do Samba Enredo e das Escolas de Samba; As Dicas do Cartola|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba Enredo|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> that has its origins in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

The modern samba that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century is predominantly in a 2/4 time signature varied with the conscious use of a sung chorus to a [[batucada]] rhythm, with various stanzas of declaratory verses. Traditionally, the samba is played by strings ([[cavaquinho]] and various types of guitar) and various percussion instruments such as [[tamborim]]. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the [[Second World War]] and the cultural impact of [[US music]] post-war, samba began to use [[trombone]]s, trumpets, [[choro]]s,{{clarification|date=February 2020}} [[flute]]s, and [[clarinet]]s.<ref>{{cite web |date=2017 |url=http://www.jazzaspensnowmass.org/the-history-of-samba-at-the-jas-cafe-corner_blog_8124.html  |title = The History of Samba at the JAS Cafe Corner}}</ref>

In addition to distinct rhythms and meters, samba brings a whole historical culture of food, varied dances (miudinho, coco, samba de roda, and pernada), parties, clothes such as linen shirts, and the [[Naïve art|Naif painting]] of established names such as [[Nelson Sargento]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], and [[Heitor dos Prazeres]]. Anonymous community artists, including painters, sculptors, designers, and stylists, make the clothes, costumes, carnival floats, and cars, opening the doors of schools of samba. There is also a great tradition of ballroom samba in Brazil, with many styles. Samba de Gafieira is the style more famous in Rio de Janeiro, where common people used to go to the gafieira{{define}} parties since the 1930s, and where the moves and identity of this dance emerged, getting more and more different from its African, European, and Cuban{{explain|date=July 2019}} origins and influences.

The National Samba Day is celebrated on December 2. The date was established at the initiative of Luis Monteiro da Costa, an alderman of [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]], in honor of [[Ary Barroso]]. He composed \"''Na Baixa do sapateiro''\" even though he had never been in Bahia. Thus 2 December marked the first visit of Ary Barroso to Salvador. Initially, this day was celebrated only in Salvador, but eventually it turned into a national holiday.

Samba is a local style in [[Southeastern Brazil]] and [[Northeast Brazil]], especially in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]], [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]] and [[Recife]]. Its importance as Brazil's national music transcends region, however; [[samba schools]], samba musicians, and carnival organizations centered on the performance of samba exist in every region of the country, even though other musical styles prevail in various regions (for instance, in [[Southern Brazil]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West Brazil]], and all of the Brazilian countryside, [[música sertaneja]], music of the ''[[sertão]]'', or Brazilian country music, is the most popular style).<ref name=\"Música-Sertaneja-CRAVO-ALBIN\">[http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/musica-sertaneja/dados-artisticos Música Sertaneja] – Dicionário Cravo Albin da Música Popular Brasileira</ref>

==Etymology==
The etymology of samba is uncertain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/samba|title=Consulte o significado / definição de samba no Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa, o dicionário online de português contemporâneo.|first=Priberam Informática|last=S.A.|website=www.priberam.pt}}</ref> Possibilites include:

* The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] verb sambar, to do joiner's work; and the Portuguese noun sambúco ([[Latin language|Latin]] [[Sambuca (instrument)|sambuca]]), a historic string instrument, a kind of harp or lyre.
* It is uncertain whether the African [[semba]] dance is related to the Brazilian Samba, and whether it is older or newer, beyond the superficial similarity of name and style. In only two [[Bantu languages]] does the verb-root \"semba\" mean \"dance\", while in others it denotes unrelated things like \"hunger\" or \"cloth\" (but not \"belly\").<ref>{{citation | author=Harry Johnston | title=A Comparative Study of the Bantu and Semi-Bantu Languages | volume=1 | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1919 | page=482 | url=https://archive.org/details/comparativestudy01johnuoft| author-link=Harry Johnston }}</ref>
[[File:Desfile Portela 2014 (906185).jpg|left|thumb|Samba parade at Rio de Janeiro, 2014]]

One of the oldest records of the word samba appeared in [[Pernambuco]] magazine's ''O carapuceiro'', dated February 1838, when Father Miguel Lopes Gama of Sacramento wrote against what he called \"the samba d'almocreve\" – not referring to the future musical genre, but a kind of merriment (dance drama) popular for black people of that time. According to Hiram Araújo da Costa, over the centuries, the festival of dances of slaves in Bahia were called samba.<ref>{{citation | author=Suzy Klein | title=Brasil, Brasil - Samba to Bossa Nova | publisher= BBC | year=2007 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008byj6| author-link=Suzy Klein }}</ref>

In the middle of the 19th century, the word samba defined different types of music made by [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]] when conducted by different types of [[Batuque (music)|Batuque]], but it assumed its own characteristics in each [[Brazilian state]], not only by the diversity of tribes for slaves, but also the peculiarity of each region in which they were settlers. Some of these popular dances were known as [[Baião (music)|Baião]], [[Bochinche]], [[Candombe]] ([[Candomblé]]), [[Catêrêtê]], [[Caxambú]], [[Choradinho]], Côco-inchádo, [[Cocumbí]], [[Corta Jaca (dance)|Córta-jáca]], [[Cururú]], [[Furrundú]], [[Jongo]], [[Lundu (dance)|Lundú]], [[Maracatu|Maracatú]], [[Maxixe (dance)|Maxíxe]], [[Quimbête]], [[São-Gonçalo]], [[Saramba]]; not to mention the many varieties of the Portuguese [[Fandango]], and the Indio dance [[Puracé]].<ref>{{citation | author=Visconde de Beaurepaire-Rohan | title=Diccionario de vocabulos Brazileiros | publisher=Imprensa nacional | year=1889 | url=https://archive.org/details/diccionariodevo00rohagoog| author-link=Henrique Pedro Carlos de Beaurepaire-Rohan }}</ref>

In [[Argentina]], there is a dance called \"[[Zamba (artform)|zamba]]\", a name which seems to share etymological origins with the samba, but the dance itself is quite different.

===Samba-enredo===<!--copied section-->
'''Samba-enredo''' or '''samba de enredo''' is a subgenre of samba, performed by a [[samba school]] (or ''escola de samba'') for the festivities of [[Brazilian Carnival]]. \"Samba-enredo\" translates literally in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] a samba-song, which is thematically bonded to the selected special theme (Enredo) of its samba school and narrates the story, which it told by the samba schools, in a lyrical form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=O Samba Enredo das Escolas de Samba do Carnaval|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba Enredo|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Each samba school performs one song in the Carnaval parade. A new song must be written each year for each school; they must be on Brazilian topics. The Carnaval parade is among other things a samba competition, with judges, who rank the new sambas according to their perceived merit.

Being by definition topical, ''sambas-enredo'' are seldom performed outside of the Carnaval environment.

For each samba school, choosing the following year's samba-enredo is a long process. Well in advance of the Carnaval parade, each samba school holds a contest for writing the song. The song is written by samba composers from within the school itself (\"Ala dos Compositores\"), or sometimes from outside composers, normally in \"''parcerias''\" (partnerships). Each school receives many—sometimes hundreds—songs, sometimes hundreds of them, each hoping to be the next samba-enredo for that year. The samba-enredo is written by these numerous composers mentioned above only after the Carnival Art Director, or \"Carnavalesco\", officially publishes the [[samba school]]'s parade theme synopsis for the year. After a careful explanation of the parade-theme, many times done by the Carnival Art Director himself, composers may ask questions in order to clarify the synopsis, so they can start writing the samba-enredos.

[[File:HK TST night 柏麗購物大道 Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard 巴西 Brasil 森巴舞娘 Samba female dancers Nov-2010 02.JPG|thumb|Samba dancer]]
The schools select their Samba Campeão within a long process of elimination, called concurso de Samba-Enredo, Eliminatórias or also Disputa de Samba. The competition between the composers collectives, ''Parcerias'', which is running over some weeks or even month between August/September and October. It ends up after with somewhere between three to four sambas, which are competing in the great ''Final do Samba''. The winner finally becomes the samba schools hymn of the year.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The phenomenon of composer´s competitions at the Great Samba-Schools from Rio de Janeiro. Composers in the middle of a musical competition and a performative event|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|publisher=Klaus Näumann, Thomas Nußbaumer u.a.|year=2018|isbn=978-3-96233-070-5|location=München|pages=213}}</ref> Around this time, the finalist sambas-enredo are played with music and are voted on by the leaders of the samba school and the ''Carnavalesco''—the artistic director of the school for Carnaval. After months of deliberation, the new samba-enredo is chosen and becomes the voice of the samba school for the next year's Carnaval. The most important night in this process, is called the \"final de samba\", or samba final, when the samba school decides between two or three samba-enredos. At the end of the process, the winning samba-enredo is selected, and it is this song that is sung during the school's parade in the [[sambadrome]]. This process normally happens in Brazil from August until November, and today is highly professionalized, with samba-composers hiring fans, producing CDs, banners, and throwing parties to promote their samba-enredo. The final chosen song, today, is also uploaded on the school's Youtube and Facebook pages to reach even more fans.

It is important to note that the samba-enredo is one of the criteria used by the Judging committee to decide who is the winner of the Carnaval parade competition. The samba-enredo must be well sung by the samba school's ''puxador'' (or singer) or the school will lose points. While the puxador sings, everyone marching in the Carnaval parade sings the samba-enredo along with him, and [[harmony]] is another judging criterion.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Batuque.jpg|thumb|The [[Batuque (music)|Batuque]] practiced in Brazil of the 19th century, Lemar Mckoy in a painting by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]]]]
Although samba exists throughout Brazil  – especially in the states of [[Bahia]], [[Maranhão]], [[Minas Gerais]], and [[São Paulo]] – in the form of various popular rhythms and dances that originated from the regional [[batuque (music)|batuque]] of the eastern Brazilian state of [[Bahia]], a music form from Cape Verde, samba is frequently identified as a musical expression of urban [[Rio de Janeiro]], where it developed during the first years of the 20th century. Early styles of samba - and specifically [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|samba de roda]] - are traced back to the Recôncavo region of [[Bahia]] during the 17th century, and the informal dancing following a candomblé ceremony. It was in Rio de Janeiro that the dance practiced by former slaves ,who migrated from Bahia came into contact with and incorporated other genres played in the city (such as the [[polka]], the [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]], the [[lundu (dance)|lundu]], and the [[xote]]), acquiring a completely unique character and creating the ''samba [[carioca]] urbana'' ([[samba school]])<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/> and the ''Carnavalesco,'' the artistic director of a samba school, who takes over an important part within the process of the creation of the new theme and within the conception of its presentation, designes all ''fantasias'' and ''alegorias'' and realizes the Tira-Dúvida with the composers of the competing sambas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Dicionário do Samba Enredo e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Samba schools are large organizations of up to 5,000 people which compete annually in the [[Carnival]] with thematic floats, elaborate costumes, and original music.

During the first decade of the 20th century, some songs under the name of samba were recorded, but these recordings did not achieve great popularity. However, in 1917, \"''Pelo Telefone''\" (\"By Telephone\") was recorded,<ref name=samba1>[http://www.brasilcultura.com.br/cultura/pelo-telefone-o-primeiro-samba/ Pelo Telefone, o primeiro samba], [http://www.revivendomusicas.com.br/produto_detalhe.asp?id=356 CD reissue]</ref> and it is considered the first true samba. The song was claimed to be authored by Ernesto dos Santos, best known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Donga (musician)|2=pt|3=Donga (músico)|4=de|5=Donga (Musiker)|preserve=1}}, with co-composition attributed to Mauro de Almeida, a well-known [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] columnist. Actually, \"Pelo Telefone\" was created by a collective of musicians who participated in celebrations at the house of [[Tia Ciata]] (Aunt Ciata). It was eventually registered by Donga and the Almeida National Library.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

\"''Pelo Telefone''\" was the first composition to achieve great success with the style of samba and to contribute to the dissemination and popularization of the genre. From that moment on, samba started to spread across the country, initially associated with Carnival and then developing its own place in the music market. There were many composers, including [[Heitor dos Prazeres]], [[João da Bahiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Sinhô]], but the sambas of these composers were \"amaxixados\" (a mix of [[maxixe (dance)|maxixe]]), known as sambas-maxixes.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

The contours of the modern samba came only at the end of the 1920s, from the innovations of a group of composers of carnival \"blocks\" (groups) in the neighborhoods of Estácio de Sá and Osvaldo Cruz, and the hills of Mangueira, Salgueiro, and São Carlos. Since then, there have been many great names in samba, such as [[Ismael Silva]], [[Cartola]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ataulfo Alves]], [[Wilson Batista]], [[Geraldo Pereira (musician)|Geraldo Pereira]], [[Zé Kéti]], [[Candeia]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Elton Medeiros]], [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], and many others.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

As the samba consolidated as an urban and modern expression, it began to be played on radio stations, spreading across the hills and neighborhoods to the affluent southern areas of Rio de Janeiro. Initially viewed with prejudice and discrimination because it had black roots, the samba, because of its hypnotic rhythms and melodic intonations in addition to its playful lyrics, eventually conquered the white middle class as well. Other musical genres derived from samba, such as [[samba-canção]], [[partido alto]], [[samba-enredo]], [[samba de gafieira]], [[samba de breque]], [[bossa nova]], [[samba-rock]], and [[pagode]], have all earned names for themselves.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

The samba is frequently associated abroad with [[Association football|football]] and Carnaval. This history began with the international success of [[Aquarela do Brasil]], by Ary Barroso, followed by [[Carmen Miranda]] (supported by [[Getúlio Vargas]] government and the US [[Good Neighbor policy]]), which led samba to the United States. [[Bossa nova]] finally entered the country into the world of samba music. Brazilian percussionist and studio musician [[Paulinho Da Costa]], currently based in Los Angeles, incorporates the rhythms and instrumentation of the samba into the albums of hundreds of American, European and Japanese artists — including producer [[Quincy Jones]], jazz performer [[Dizzy Gillespie]], pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] and vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/free-ride-mw0000102458/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Free Ride|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Quincy|date= 2002|title= Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones|url= https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233|location= |publisher= Three Rivers Press|page= [https://archive.org/details/qautobiographyof00jone_0/page/233 233]|isbn= 978-0767905107|url-access= registration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Off the Wall|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/till-i-loved-you-mw0000197648/credits |last= |first=|date= |website= All Music|title= Till I Loved You|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>

The success of the samba in Europe and Japan only confirms its ability to win fans, regardless of their language. Currently, there are hundreds of [[samba schools]] on European soil and scattered among countries like Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Already in Japan, the records invest heavily in the launch of former sambistas' set of discs, which eventually created a market composed solely of catalogs of Japanese record labels.<ref name=\"Samba-ABM\"/>

=== Favela and the Tias from Bahia  ===

From the second half of the 19th century onward, as blacks, mestizas, and ex-soldiers of the [[War of Canudos]] in Rio de Janeiro came from various parts of Brazil (mainly Bahia) and settled in the vicinity of Morro da Conceição, Pedra do Sal, Praça Mauá, Praça Onze, Cidade Nova, Saúde, and Zona Portuária. These stands form poor communities that these people called the [[favela]]s (later the term became synonymous with the irregular buildings of the poor).

These communities would be the scene of a significant part of Brazilian [[black people|black culture]], particularly with respect to [[Candomblé]] and ''samba amaxixado'' at that time. Among the early highlights were the musician and dancer Hilário Jovino Ferreira—responsible for the founding of several blocks of [[afoxé]] and Carnival's ranchos—and ''Tias Baianas'', a term given to the female descendants of Bahian slaves.

Thus, the samba and musical genre was born in the houses of ''Tias Baianas'' (Bahian aunts) in the beginning of the 20th century, as a descendant of the style [[lundu (dance)|lundu]] of the candomblé de terreiro parties between [[umbigada]] (Samba) and [[capoeira]]'s pernadas, marked in [[pandeiro]], [[prato-e-faca]] (plate-and-knife) and in the ''palmas'', hand claps. The most famous of them is ''Tia Ciata'': Her House, situated at Rio´s central Region of Praça Onze, was one of the most popular places to meet, sing and dance and compose together. But not just that: It was also known as a place, where the immigrants from Bahia practiced religious rituals and ceremonies of Candomblé together in the hidden backyards, that where utilized as ''Terreiros''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sambaenredo.com|title=Uma história do Samba; Dicionário do Samba e das Escolas de Samba|last=Jurth|first=Friederike|date=|website=Samba-Enredo|url-status=live|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> There are some controversies about the word ''samba-raiado'', one of the first appointments to the samba. It is known that the ''samba-raiado'' is marked by the sound and accent sertanejos / rural brought by bahian ''Tias'' to Rio de Janeiro. According to João da Baiana, the ''samba-raiado'' was the same as ''[[Chula (music)|chula]] raiada'' or [[Partido alto|samba de partido-alto]]. For the sambist Caninha, this was the first name would have heard at the home of Tia Dadá. At the same time, there were the ''samba-corrido'', a line that had more work together with the rural Bahian accent, and the samba-chulado, a more rhyming and melodic style that characterized the urban samba carioca.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

By the 1870s, Republican propagandists were attempting to prohibit samba on the pretext that folklorist dances shamed Brazil's national image. It would take the edict of a federal administration to halt the persecution of neighborhood samba groups and to recognize officially their parades. Later, the views of anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, and Getrllio Vargas, who became Brazil's new populist president in 1930, provided the country with fresh perspectives on racial mixing. Under Vargas, samba schools and carnaval parades were supported by the state and quickly established themselves all over Brazil. Samba significantly benefited from these political efforts to create a homogeneous national culture. While certain types of music suggested different racial or class origins, samba dissipated social antagonisms and helped unify a society that varied in its origins, appearance, and ways of living and thinking. Samba's triumph over the airwaves allowed it to penetrate all sectors of Brazilian society.<ref>Gilman, B., \"The Politics of Samba.\" Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 2001:2(2). http://journal.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2.2-Gilman.pdf accessed 26-4-2014.</ref>

According to anthropologist Hermano Vianna, configuring Samba as a symbol of Brazilianness was possible thanks to the cultural exchange between the working classes and intellectual elite. He cites a guitar meeting between anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, the historian Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, promoter and journalist Prudente de Moraes Neto, the classical composer Villa Lobos and pianist Lucio Gallet, all representative of the intellectual and cultural elite of white origin on the one hand; and Pixinguinha musician and composers / samba Donga and Patrick Teixeira, from the popular and crossbred layers on the other, saying how the occasion marked the meeting of two different or even opposing groups of Brazilian society.<ref>Vianna H., \"The Mystery of Samba: Popular Music and National Identity in Brazil\" (trans.

=== Scenes in Bahia and São Paulo ===
[[File:Пандейру и каквако.jpg|right|thumb|Pandeiro and cavaco, the nucleus of common samba instrumentation]]

The urban carioca samba is the anchor of 20th century ''\"Brazilian samba\"'' par excellence. However, before this type of samba was to consolidate as the ''\"national samba\"'' in Brazil, there were traditional forms of sambas in Bahia and [[São Paulo]].

The rural Bahia samba acquired additional names as choreographic variations – for example, the  ''\"samba-de-chave\"'', where the soloist dancer faking looking ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'' in the middle of a key, and when found, was replaced.{{clarify|date=November 2010}} The poetic structure of Bahian samba followed the way [[call-and-response]]—composed of a single verse, a solo, followed by another, and repeated by the chorus of dancers as the falderal. With no chorus, the samba is called ''samba-corrido'', which is an uncommon variant. The [[chant]]s were taken by one singer, one of the musicians, or soloist dancer. Another peculiarity of Bahian samba was a form of competition that dances sometimes presented: it was a dispute between participants to see who performed better. Besides the [[umbigada]], common to all the bahianian samba, the Bahia presented three basic steps: ''[[corta Jaca (samba step)|corta-a-jaca]]'', ''separa-o-visgo'', and ''apanha-o-bag''. There is also another choreographic element danced by women: the ''miudinho'' (this also appeared in São Paulo, as dance solo in the center of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]''). The instruments of the Bahian samba were [[pandeiro]]s, [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], guitars, and sometimes the [[castanets]] and [[berimbau]]s.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

In São Paulo state, samba became the domain of blacks and [[caboclo]]s. In rural areas, samba can occur without the traditional umbigada. There are also other choreographic variations—the dancers may be placed in rows with men on one side and women on another. The instruments of the samba paulista were [[viola]]s and [[pandeiro]]s. It is possible that the early provision of the ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]'', in Goiás, has been modified by the influence of quadrilha or cateretê. According to historian Luís da Câmara Cascudo, it is possible to observe the influence of city in the samba, by the fact that it is also danced by pair connections.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

One of the most noticeable groups of São Paulo's samba, Demônios da Garoa (Drizzle's Demons), had a strong link with Adoniran Barbosa, who composed their songs. Songs like \"Samba do Arnesto\" and \"Saudosa Maloca\" became legendary, recognized as \"the real Samba Paulistano\". The group is still active, but with a different lineup. In 2000, one of their most famous songs, \"Trem das Onze\", was elected as an official symbol of the city of São Paulo.

=== First decades of the 20th century ===

==== \"Pelo Telefone\" ====

Tia Ciata, grandmother of the composer [[Bucy Moreira]], was responsible for the sedimentation of samba carioca. According to the [[folklore]] of that time, for a samba musician to achieve success, he would have to pass the house of Tia Ciata and be approved on the ''rodas de samba''. Many compositions were created and sung in improvisation, where the samba ''Pelo Telefone'' (from Donga and Mauro de Almeida), samba for which there were also many other versions, but to come to the history of samba,  Pelo Telefone was the first recorded Samba, in 1917

Meanwhile, other recordings have been done as samba before ''Pelo Telefone'', as this composition was done by double Donga / Mauro de Almeida, who is regarded as a founder of the genre. Still, the song is written and discussed, and its proximity to the [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe]] made it finally be designated samba-maxixe. This section was influenced by [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe dance]] and basically played the piano—unlike the Rio samba played in the Morros hills—and the composer has musician Sinhô, self-titled ''o rei do samba'' (\"the king of Samba\") which with other pioneers such as Heitor dos Prazeres and Caninha, lay the first foundations of the musical genre.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>

==== Turma do Estácio ====

The growing shantytowns ([[favela]]s) in the hills of suburban Rio would become the home of new musical talents. Almost simultaneously, the ''samba carioca'', which was born in the city center, would climb the slopes of the hills and spread outside the periphery, to the point that, over time, it came to be identified as ''samba de morro'' (samba from the hills).

At the end of the 1920s, the carnival samba of blocks of the districts [[Estácio, Rio de Janeiro|Estácio de Sá]] and [[Oswaldo Cruz (Rio de Janeiro)|Oswaldo Cruz]] was born, and in the hills of [[Mangueira]], Salgueiro, and São Carlos, there were innovations in rhythmic samba that persist until the present day. This group, the ''Turma do Estácio'', from which would arise ''Deixa Falar'', was the first samba school in Brazil. Formed by some composers in the neighborhood of Estácio, including Alcebíades Barcellos (aka Bide) Armando Marçal, [[Ismael Silva]], Nilton Bastos and the more \"[[malandro]]s\" such as Baiaco, Brancura, Mano Edgar, Mano Rubem, the ''\"Turma do Estácio\"'' marked the history of the Brazilian samba by injecting more pace to the genre one performed, which has the endorsement of the youth's middle class, as the ex-student of law [[Ary Barroso]] and former student of medicine [[Noel Rosa]].<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>

Initially a \"[[:pt:rancho carnavalesco]]\", then a [[Carnival block]], and finally a samba school, the ''Deixa Falar'' was the first to Rio Carnival parade in the sound of an orchestra made up of percussion [[surdo]]s, [[tambourine]]s, and [[cuíca]]s, who joined [[pandeiro]] and [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]]. This group was instrumental and is called ''bateria'', and it lends itself to the monitoring of a type of samba that was quite different from those of Donga, Sinhô, and [[Pixinguinha]]. The samba of Estácio de Sá signed up quickly as the samba carioca par excellence.

The ''Turma do Estácio'' has made the appropriate rhythmic samba were so it could be accompanied in the carnival's parade, thus distancing the progress ''samba-amaxixado'' of composers such as Sinhô. Moreover, its ''[[roda (formation)|roda]]s'' of samba were attended by composers from other Rio hills, as [[Cartola]], [[Carlos Cachaça]], and then [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], e Geraldo Pereira, Paulo da Portela, Alcides Malandro Histórico, Manacéia, Chico Santana, and others. Accompanied by a pandeiro, a tambourine, a cuíca and a surdo, they created and spread the samba-de-morro.

=== Popularization in the 1930s and 1940s ===
[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|Portuguese Brazilian singer [[Carmen Miranda]] helped popularize samba internationally.]]

After the founding of ''\"Deixa Falar\"'', the phenomenon of the samba schools took over the scene and helped boost Rio's samba subgenera of [[Partido Alto]], singing and challenging in ''candomblé terreiros'' the [[samba-enredo]].

From the 1930s, the popularization of radio in Brazil helped to spread the samba across the country, mainly the subgenres ''samba-canção'' and ''samba-exaltação''. The ''samba-canção'' was released in 1928 with the recording \"Ai, yo-yo\" by Aracy Cortes. Also known as \"samba half of the year\", the ''samba-canção'' became established in the next decade. It was a slow and rhythmic samba music and had an emphasis on melody and generally easy acceptance. This aspect was later influenced by the rhythms of foreigners, first by foxtrot in the 1940s and then [[bolero]] the 1950s. The most famous composers were [[Noel Rosa]], [[Ary Barroso]], [[Lamartine Babo]], Braguinha (also known as João de Barro), and [[Ataulfo Alves]]. Other practitioners of this style were Antonio Maria, Custódio Mesquita, [[Dolores Duran]], Fernando Lobo, Ismael Neto, Lupicínio Rodrigues, Batatinha, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]] (this latter by sharply satirical doses{{clarify|date=November 2010}}).<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/><ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>

The ideology of [[Getúlio Vargas]]'s Estado Novo changed the scene of the samba. With ''[[Aquarela do Brasil]]'', composed by [[Ary Barroso]] and recorded by [[Francisco Alves]] in 1939, the ''samba-exaltação'' become the first success abroad. This kind of samba was characterized by extensive compositions of melody and patriotic verses. [[Carmen Miranda]] popularized samba internationally through her Hollywood films.

With the support of the Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas, the samba won status as the \"official music\" of Brazil. With this status of national identity came the recognition of the intellectual and classical composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], who arranged a recording with the maestro [[Leopold Stokowski]] in 1940, which involved [[Cartola]], Donga, [[João da Baiana]], [[Pixinguinha]], and [[Zé da Zilda]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

Also in the 1940s, there arose a new crop of artists: Francisco Alves, Mário Reis, Orlando Silva, Silvio Caldas, [[Aracy de Almeida]], [[Dalva de Oliveira]], and [[Elizeth Cardoso]], among others. Others such as Assis Valente, Ataulfo Alves, [[Dorival Caymmi]], [[Herivelto Martins]], [[Pedro Caetano]], and [[Synval Silva]] led the samba to the music industry.<ref name=\"sambacliquemusic\"/>

=== New beat in the 1950s: the Bossa Nova ===
[[File:João Gilberto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[João Gilberto]], [[bossa nova]] pioneer]]

A movement was born in the southern area of Rio de Janeiro, strongly influenced by [[jazz]], marking the history of samba and [[Brazilian popular music]] in the 1950s. The [[bossa nova]] emerged at the end of that decade, with an original rhythmic accent which divided the phrasing of the samba and added influences of [[impressionist music]] and jazz and a different style of singing which was both intimate and gentle. After precursors such as [[Johnny Alf]], [[João Donato]], and musicians like [[Luis Bonfá]] and Garoto, this subgenre was inaugurated by [[João Gilberto]], [[Tom Jobim]], and [[Vinicius de Moraes]]. It then had a generation of disciples and followers including [[Carlos Lyra]], [[Roberto Menescal]], [[Durval Ferreira]], and groups like [[Tamba Trio]], [[Bossa 3]], [[Zimbo Trio]], and [[The Cariocas]].<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

The [[sambalanço]] also began at the end of the 1950s. It was a branch of the popular bossa nova (most appreciated by the middle class) which also mingled samba rhythms and American jazz. Sambalanço was often found at suburban dances of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. This style was developed by artists such as [[Bebeto]], [[Bedeu]], [[Scotland 7]], [[Djalma Ferreira]], [[the Daydreams]], [[Dhema]], [[Ed Lincoln]], [[Elza Soares]], and [[Miltinho]], among others. In the 21st century, groups like [[Funk Como Le Gusta]] and [[Clube do Balanço]] continue to keep this subgenre alive.

=== Rediscovering of samba's roots in the 1960s and 1970s ===
In the 1960s, Brazil became politically divided with the arrival of a [[military dictatorship]], and the leftist musicians of bossa nova started to gather attention to the music made in the ''[[favela]]s''. Many popular artists were discovered at this time. Musicians like [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], [[Guilherme de Brito]], [[Velha Guarda da Portela]], [[Zé Keti]], and [[Clementina de Jesus]] recorded their first albums during this time.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

In the 1970s, samba returned strongly to the air waves with composers and singers like [[Paulinho da Viola]], [[Martinho da Vila]], [[Clara Nunes]], and [[Beth Carvalho]] dominating the hit parade. Great samba lyricists like [[Paulo César Pinheiro]] (especially in the praised partnership with [[João Nogueira]]) and [[Aldir Blanc]] started to appear around that time.

==== Rapprochement with the hill ====
[[File:Vinicius.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vinicius de Moraes]]]]

With bossa nova, samba is further away from its popular roots. The influence of jazz deepened, and techniques have been incorporated from classical music. From a festival in [[Carnegie Hall]] of New York, in 1962, the bossa nova reached worldwide success. But over the 1960s and 1970s, many artists who emerged—like [[Chico Buarque]], Billy Blanco, [[Martinho da Vila]], and [[Paulinho da Viola]]—advocated the return of the samba beat in its traditional form. They also wanted veterans like [[Candeia]], [[Cartola]], [[Nelson Cavaquinho]], and [[Zé Kéti]] to return. In the early 1960s, the \"Movement for Revitalization of Traditional Samba\", promoted by Center for Popular Culture, started in partnership with the Brazilian National Union of Students. During the 1960s, some samba groups appeared and were formed by previous experiences with the world of samba and songs recorded by great names of Brazilian music. Among them were The Cinco Crioulos, The Voz do Morro, Mensageiros do Samba, and The Cinco Só.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

Outside the main scene of the Brazilian Popular Music festivals, the sambists founded the Bienal do Samba in the late 1960s, and it became the space for the big names of the genre and followers. Even in the final decade, the ''samba-empolgação'' (samba-excitement) of carnival blocks ''Bafo da Onça'', ''Cacique de Ramos,'' and ''Boêmios de Irajá'' came into being.<ref name=\"sambadmpb\"/>

==== Fusion: the samba-funk ====
Also in the 1960s came the [[Samba rock|samba funk]]. The samba-funk emerged at the end of the 1960s with pianist [[Dom Salvador]] and his group, which merged the samba with American [[funk]], which was then newly arrived in the Brazil. With the departure of Dom Salvador to the United States, the band broke up, but at the beginning of the 1970s, some ex-members, including Luiz Carlos, José Carlos Barroso, and Oberdan joined Christovao Bastos, Jamil Joanes, Cláudio Stevenson and Lúcio da Silva  to form [[Banda Black Rio]]. The new group has deepened the work of Don Salvador in the double mixture of the bar with the Brazilian samba funk of the American Quaternary, based on the dynamics of implementation, driven by drums and bass. Even after the Banda Black Rio in the 1980s, British disc jockeys began to play the group's work. It was rediscovered throughout Europe, but mainly in UK and Germany.<ref name=\"samba1\" />

==== Partido-Alto for the masses ====
At the turn of the 1960s to the 1970s, the young [[Martinho da Vila]] would give a new face to the traditional sambas-enredo established by authors such as [[Silas de Oliveira]] and Mano Decio da Viola, compressing them and expanding its potential in the music market. Martin popularized the style of the [[Partido alto]] with songs like \"Casa de Bamba\" and \"Pequeno Burguês\" and launched his first album in 1969.

Although the term ''partido alto'' originally arose at the beginning of the 1900s to describe instrumental music, the term came to be used to signify a type of samba which is characterized by a highly percussive beat of [[pandeiro]], using the palm of the hand in the center of the instrument in place. The harmony of Partido alto is always higher in pitch, usually played by a set of percussion instruments (usually surdo, pandeiro, and tambourine) and accompanied by a [[cavaquinho]] and/or a guitar.

Also in that decade, some popular singers and composers appeared in the samba, including [[Alcione Nazaré|Alcione]], [[Beth Carvalho]], and [[Clara Nunes]]. As highlighted in [[city of São Paulo]], Geraldo Filme was one of the leading names in samba paulistano, next to Germano Mathias, Osvaldinho of Cuíca, Tobias da Vai-Vai, Aldo Bueno, and [[Adoniran Barbosa]].

=== 1980s until 1990s ===
[[File:Zeca Pagodinho.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Zeca Pagodinho]], a popular contemporary sambist]]

In the early 1980s, after having been eclipsed by the popularity of [[disco]] and [[Brazilian rock]], Samba reappeared in the media with a musical movement created in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. It was the ''[[pagode]]'', a renewed samba, with new instruments like the [[banjo (samba)|banjo]] and the [[tan-tan]]. It also had a new language that reflected the way that many people actually spoke by including heavy ''gíria'', or [[slang]]. The most popular artists were [[Zeca Pagodinho]], [[Almir Guineto]], [[Grupo Fundo de Quintal]], [[Jorge Aragão]], and [[Jovelina Pérola Negra]].<ref name=\"cliquemusic/pagode\">{{cite web| title = Pagode, O samba que vem do fundo do quintal|url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20 |accessdate=23 August 2008 }} ({{Google translation|en|pt|http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/br/Generos/Generos.asp?Nu_Materia=20}}</ref>

In 1995, the world saw one of the most popular [[Pagode]] groups, the [[Gera Samba]], later renamed to ''[[É o Tchan]]'', come out from Savador. This group created the most sexual dance of the Pagode during the 1990s, mixing a lot of Axé music in it. Some groups like [[Patrulha do Samba]] and [[Harmonia do Samba]], also mixed in a bit of Axé. Samba, as a result, morphed during this period, embracing types of music that were growing popular in the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Hip hop music|rap]], [[reggae]], and rock. Examples of Samba fusions with popular Caribbean music is samba-rap, [[samba-rock]], and [[samba-reggae]], all of which were efforts to not only entertain, but also to unify all Blacks throughout the Americas culturally and politically via song. In other words, samba-rap and the like often carried lyrics that encouraged Black pride, and spoke out against social injustice.<ref>\"The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music\" ''Latin American Music Review'' 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref> Samba, however, is not accepted by all as the national music of Brazil, or as a valuable art form. Light-skinned \"upper-class\" Brazilians often associated Samba with dark-skinned blacks because of its arrival from West Africa. As a result, there are some light-skinned Brazilians who claim that samba is the music of low-class, dark-skinned Brazilians and, therefore, is a \"thing of bums and bandits\".<ref>R.J.'s Gringo Guides, [http://www.gringoguides.com/sambaracism.shtml \"The Roots of Racism in Samba in Brazil\"], retrieved 14 Feb 2008.</ref>

Samba continued to act as a unifying agent during the 1990s, when Rio stood as a national Brazilian symbol. Even though it was not the capital city, Rio acted as a Brazilian unifier, and the fact that samba originated in Rio helped the unification process. In 1994, the [[FIFA World Cup]] had its own samba composed for the occasion, the \"Copa 94\". The [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], in which samba played a major cultural role, holds the record for highest attendance in World Cup history. Samba is thought to be able to unify because individuals participate in it regardless of social or ethnic group. Today, samba is viewed as perhaps the only uniting factor in a country fragmented by political division.<ref>[[Behague, Gerard]]. \"Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music ).\" Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006).</ref>

The Afro-Brazilians played a significant role in the development of the samba over time. This change in the samba was an integral part of Brazilian nationalism, which was referred to as \"Brazilianism\".
<blockquote>
\"What appears to be new is the local response to that flow, in that instead of simply assimilating outside influences into a local genre or movement, the presence of foreign genres is acknowledged
as part of the local scene: samba-rock, samba-reggae, samba-rap.
But this acknowledgment does not imply mere imitation of the foreign
models or, for that matter, passive consumption by national audiences.\" – [[Gerard Béhague]], ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology.'' Pg. 84

===Samba in the 21st century===
[[File:Marcelo D2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marcelo D2]] frequently mixes [[hip hop]] with samba.]]
From the year 2000 onwards, there were some artists who were looking to reconnect the most popular traditions of samba. The cases of Marquinhos of Oswaldo Cruz and Teresa Cristina, were, among others, the ones that contributed to the revitalization of the region of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro. In São Paulo, samba resumed the tradition with concerts in Sesc Pompéia Club and with the work of several groups, including the group Quinteto em Branco e Preto which developed the event \"Pagode da Vela\" (\"Pagoda of Sail\"). These all helped to attract many artists from Rio de Janeiro, which has established residence in neighborhoods of the capital paulistana.

Samba was also mixed with [[drum and bass]] leading to the foundation of [[Sambass]]. Despite the evolution during the decades, Samba still remains a traditional dance, and cannot be considered a sport.

In 2004, the minister of culture [[Gilberto Gil]] submitted to [[Unesco]] an application for declaring samba as a Cultural Heritage of Humanity in the category \"Intangible Goods\" by the Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage. In 2005 the samba-de-roda of Baiano Recôncavo was proclaimed part of the Heritage of Humanity by Unesco, in the category of \"Oral and intangible expressions\". The Samba is often performed on different dance shows, such as Strictly Come Dancing.

|ShortSummary    = In the aftermath of Gibbs being shot, he is brought to the U.S.S. ''Daniel Webster'', where he is treated by Navy Doctor Cyril Taft ([[Jon Cryer]]). As the team waits for news on Gibbs' current condition, DiNozzo and CIA officer Joanna Teague travel to China to dismantle the Calling. Gibbs eventually survives his surgery and subsequently returns to active duty while forming a strong friendship with Dr. Taft while Tony personally tracks down and kills the leader of the Calling, Daniel Budd ([[Giles Matthey]]). During all this, the Calling dupes the United States into believing that [[North Korea]] intends to ignite [[World War III]] with launching a nuclear warhead from one of their [[Sinpo-class submarine]]s.

After the team locates Kort and finally kills him, Tony visits Gibbs and announces he will resign so he can take care of Tali as a single dad, intending on taking her to Israel to \"look for some answers\" and then to Paris, as \"Ziva loves Paris,\" showing his belief that Ziva may still be alive as her body had never been found.

Tony's father tries to reassure his son, but Abby and McGee solemnly visit Tony at his apartment as he is ready to leave, and he realizes that Ziva has apparently died in the attack. A devastated Tony is left to pick up the pieces of his life, and Mossad director Orli Elbaz visits NCIS to inform Tony of his daughter with Ziva that he never knew existed, named Tali in honor of Ziva's late sister. At first, Tony is offended that Ziva never even told him about Tali and struggles to find his footing as a father, but he is assisted by the rest of the team and his own father along the way. After the team locates Kort and finally kills him, Tony visits Gibbs and announces he will resign so he can take care of Tali as a single dad, intending on taking her to Israel to \"look for some answers\" and then to Paris, as \"Ziva loves Paris,\" showing his belief that Ziva may still be alive as her body had never been found. He then says farewell to the rest of the team.

'''Constantine II''' ({{lang-el|Κωνσταντίνος Βʹ}}, ''Konstantínos II'', {{IPA-el|ˌkonstanˈdinos|pron}}; born 2 June 1940) reigned as the [[List of kings of Greece|King]] of [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]], from 1964 until the abolition of the [[Monarchy of Greece|monarchy]] in 1973.

He acceded as king following the death of his father King [[Paul of Greece|Paul]] in March 1964. Later that year he married [[Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark]] with whom he eventually had five children. Although the accession of the young monarch was initially regarded auspiciously, his reign soon became controversial: Constantine's involvement in the [[Apostasia of 1965|''Apostasia'' of July 1965]] created unrest among sections of the population and aggravated the ongoing political instability that culminated in the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Colonels' Coup of 21 April 1967]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The coup was successful, leaving Constantine, as the [[head of state]], little room to manoeuvre since he had no loyal military forces on which to rely. As a result, he reluctantly agreed to inaugurate the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]] on the condition that it be made up largely of civilian ministers. On 13 December 1967, Constantine was forced to flee the country, following an unsuccessful countercoup against the junta. He remained (formally) the head of state in exile until the junta conducted the 1 June [[1973 Greek republic referendum]] which abolished the monarchy.

This abolition was confirmed after the [[metapolitefsi|fall of the junta]] by the [[1974 Greek republic referendum]] on 8 December, which established the [[Third Hellenic Republic]]. Constantine, who was not allowed to return to Greece to campaign,<ref>Hope, Kevin. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5abf4fe0-04b0-11e1-91d9-00144feabdc0.html Referendum plan faces hurdles].

A referendum on July 29, 1973, confirmed these actions. After the election of a civilian government in November 1974, another referendum on the monarchy was conducted on 8 December. The monarchy was rejected, and Constantine, who had protested the vote of 1973, accepted the result.}}</ref>

Constantine is also a former competitive [[yachting|sailor]] and [[Olympic Games|Olympian]], winning a [[Olympic medal|gold medal]] in the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] in [[Sailing at the 1960 Summer Olympics – Dragon|the Dragon class]], and later serving on the [[International Olympic Committee]].

Constantine was born at the Psychiko Palace in [[Psychiko]], a suburb of  Athens. He was the nephew of [[George II of Greece|King George II]], and also the second child and only son of the king's brother and [[heir presumptive]], [[Paul of Greece|Crown Prince Paul]]. His mother was Princess [[Frederica of Hanover]].<ref name=\"waiting\">{{cite book | author=Curley, W.J.P. | title=Monarchs In Waiting| location=London |publisher=Hutchinson & Co Ltd | year=1975 | isbn=0-09-122310-5 |pages=39–41}}</ref> Constantine's older sister [[Queen Sofía of Spain]] is the wife of the retired King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], while his younger sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]], has never been married.

Constantine was just one year old when [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] [[Battle of Greece|invaded Greece]], and he spent the next four years in exile in [[Egypt]] and [[Cape Town, South Africa]] (where his sister Irene was born) with his family. He returned to Greece with his family in 1946. King George died in 1947, and Constantine's father became the new king, making Constantine the crown prince. He was educated at a preparatory school and later a boarding school (Victoria College of Alexandria, Egypt, where his classmates included King Hussein of Jordan and actor Omar Sharif).<ref name=\"waiting\" /> A fellow student recalled him as \"a good chap, a young man with all the right instincts. He was at his best on the playing fields.\"<ref name=\"waiting\" />

Constantine served in all three branches of the [[Hellenic Armed Forces]], attending the requisite military academies. He also attended the [[NATO]] Air Force Special Weapons School in Germany, as well as the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], where he took courses in the school of law.<ref name=\"waiting\" /> He is an honorable member of the [[International Soling Association]] and honorable President of the [[International Dragon Association]].

Constantine was an able sportsman. In 1960, aged 20, he won an Olympic gold medal in sailing ([[Dragon (keelboat)|dragon class]]), which was the first Greek gold medal in sailing since the Stockholm [[1912 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/medallists-results?athletename=&category=&games=&sport=&event=&mengender=false&womengender=false&mixedgender=false&teamclassification=false&individualclassification=false&continent=1&country=30784&goldmedal=true&silvermedal=false&bronzemedal=false&worldrecord=false&olympicrecord=false&targetresults=true&sortorder=date&resultspageipp=50|title=Olympic Records World Records|publisher=Olympic |accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref> He was also a strong swimmer and had a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[karate]], with interests in [[Squash (sport)|squash]], track events and riding.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> In 1963 Constantine became a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). He resigned in 1974 because he was no longer a Greek resident, and was made an Honorary IOC Member.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ko/crown-prince-konstantinos-1.html Crown Prince Konstantinos]. sports-reference.com</ref>

==Reign==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2014}}
In March 1964, King Paul died of cancer, and the 23-year-old Constantine succeeded him as king. Prior to this, Constantine had already been appointed as [[regent]] for his ailing father.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ailing Greek King Names Son Regent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/21/ailing-greek-king-names-son-regent.html|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=The New York Times|date=21 February 1964}}</ref>

King Paul's long-time prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] regarded him partly responsible for his [[1963 Greek legislative election|fall from leadership in 1963]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

However, due to his youth, he was also perceived as a promise of change. The accession of Constantine coincided with the recent [[1964 Greek legislative election|election]] of [[Center Union|Centrist]] [[George Papandreou, senior|George Papandreou]] as [[Prime Minister of Greece|prime minister]] in February 1964, which ended 11 years of right-wing rule by the [[National Radical Union]] (ERE).

Greece was still feeling the effects of the [[Greek Civil War|Civil War]] of 1944–49 between communists and monarchists, and society was strongly polarised between the royalist/conservative right and the liberal/socialist left. It was hoped that the new young king and the new prime minister would be able to overcome past dissensions.

Initially, relations between the king and Papandreou seemed good, but by 1965, they had deteriorated. The conservative establishment feared the rising influence of Papandreou's left-leaning son [[Andreas Papandreou|Andreas]], and the outbreak of the purported [[ASPIDA scandal|''ASPIDA'' scandal]] seemed to confirm their suspicions. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The name of Andreas Papandreou was implicated in the case, and when the defence minister, Petros Garoufalias tried to form a committee of inquiry into the alleged scandal, the prime minister forced his resignation. Immediately, George Papandreou assigned the defence portfolio to himself, which caused alarm in the palace and the conservative security circles, which interpreted this move as an attempt by Papandreou to control the army. Constantine refused to accept the self-appointment, and a new political issue resulted.

Constantine proposed the appointment of any other person of the prime minister's choosing as defence minister because, as the king argued, there was a conflict of interest: the prime minister's son was allegedly involved in the scandal.

Papandreou rejected the king's proposition, although he had initially shown some willingness to accept it, and submitted his own resignation, stating that it was well within his constitutional powers as the elected prime minister commanding a Parliamentary majority to appoint his ministers at his pleasure, and it was beyond the constitutional powers of the king to refuse him this right. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

A short time after his resignation, Constantine appointed a new government led by [[Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas]], who failed to ensure the [[confidence (politics)|Parliament's confidence]]. This appointment, which became known as the \"Royal Coup\" ({{lang|el|Το Βασιλικό Πραξικόπημα}}), evoked much criticism as being unconstitutional. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

According to the critics, the appointment of this and successive governments consisting of aisle-crossers instead of the proclamation of new elections, caused a constitutional crisis and political instability that lasted for more than two years and led to the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

After his failure, Novas was succeeded by [[Ilias Tsirimokos]], who also failed to form a stable government and was dismissed. Constantine next appointed some of Papandreou's dissidents, known as the [[Apostasia of 1965|July Apostates]] and led by [[Stefanos Stefanopoulos]], to form a government of \"king's men\", which lasted until December 1966, amidst mounting strikes and protests, supported by the right-wing ERE.

When Stefanopoulos resigned in frustration, Constantine appointed a caretaker government under [[Ioannis Paraskevopoulos]], which called elections for May 1967. This government did not even last until the scheduled elections. It was replaced on 3 April 1967 by another caretaker government under the leader of the ERE, [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]].

==Greek dictatorship 1967–1974==
{{BLP sources|date=April 2017|reason=several lines have major [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] issues|section}}Elections were scheduled for 28 May 1967, with expectations of a wide Centrist victory. According to United States diplomat John Day, the Americans worried that, due to the old age of [[Georgios Papandreou|George Papandreou]], [[Andreas Papandreou]] would have a very powerful role in the next government.

According to the United States diplomats Robert Keely and John Owens, who were attached to the United States embassy in Greece at the time, Constantine asked United States Ambassador [[Phillips Talbot]] what the attitude of the United States government would be to an extra-parliamentary solution to this problem. The embassy responded negatively in principle, adding that \"US reaction to such a move cannot be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at time\". To this day, Constantine denies all this. According to then-Ambassador from the United States Phillips Talbot, after this communication, Constantine met with the generals of the army, who promised the king that they would not take any action before the coming elections. However, they were nervous by the proclamations of Andreas Papandreou and reserved to themselves the right to reconsider possible courses of action according to the results of the election.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\">TV documentary \"[http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 ΤΑ ΔΙΚΑ ΜΑΣ 60's – Μέρος 3ο: ΧΑΜΕΝΗ ΑΝΟΙΞΗ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406222452/http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 |date=6 April 2008 }}\" Stelios Kouloglu</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2019}}

A traditionalist, right-wing nationalist group of middle-ranking army officers led by Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] took action first and staged a [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|''coup d'état'' on 21 April]]. The coup leaders met Constantine at his residence in [[Tatoi]], which was surrounded by tanks to prevent resistance. Constantine later recounted that the officers of the tank platoons believed they were carrying out the coup under his orders.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\" /> The king argued with the colonels and initially dismissed them. Later in the day, he went to the Ministry of National Defence, where all coup leaders were gathered, and had a discussion with Kanellopoulos and with leading generals. He agreed to concede to the military demands  and swear the new regime in only when the junta agreed to include a number of civilian politicians, with a royalist nominee, [[Konstantinos Kollias]], as prime minister. [[Panayotis Kanellopoulos]], the last legitimate prime minister of Greece prior to the coup, acting as witness for the [[prosecution]], at the [[Greek junta trials|junta trials]] in 1975 during [[metapolitefsi]], testified how he was arrested by [[Machine gun|machine-gun]] toting soldiers and transported to the palace to meet King Constantine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} He added that during the meeting he urged the king to use his status as [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of Greece|Greek military]] to order loyal officers to crush the coup. Constantine apparently refused to do so because he feared bloodshed.<ref name=\"Time Korydallos\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917678,00.html The Colonels on Trial]. ''Time Magazine'' (11 August 1975)</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2019}}

From the outset, the relationship between Constantine and the regime of the colonels was an uneasy one.<ref name=\"b1\">{{cite book | author=Hindley, G | title=The Royal Families of Europe| url=https://archive.org/details/royalfamiliesofe00hind | url-access=registration | location=London |publisher=Lyric Books Ltd | year=1979 | isbn=0-07-093530-0|pages= [https://archive.org/details/royalfamiliesofe00hind/page/126 126–127]}}</ref> Constantine organised a counter-coup, though no help or involvement of the United States was forthcoming. The king finally decided to launch his counter-coup on 13 December 1967. Since Athens was effectively in the hands of the junta militarily, Constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of [[Kavala]], east of [[Thessaloniki]]. There he hoped to be among troops loyal only to him. The vague plan he and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would advance to Thessaloniki (Greece's second biggest city and unofficial capital of northern Greece) and take it. Constantine planned to install an alternative administration there. International recognition, which he believed to be forthcoming, as well as internal pressure from the fact that Greece would have been split into two governments would, the king hoped, force the junta to resign, leaving the field clear for him to return triumphant to Athens.

In the early morning hours of 13 December, the king boarded the royal plane together with [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece]], their two young children, [[Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark|Princess Alexia]] and [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece|Prince Pavlos]], his mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], and his sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]]. Constantine also took with him Premier Kollias. At first things seemed to be going according to plan. Constantine was well received in Kavala which, militarily, was under the command of a general loyal to him. The air force and navy, both strongly royalist and not involved in the 1967 coup, immediately declared for him and mobilised. Another of Constantine's generals effectively cut all communication between Athens and the north. However, the king's plans were overly bureaucratic, naïvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be followed. Further, the king was obsessive about avoiding \"bloodshed\" even where the junta would be the attacker.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Under these circumstances, rather than managing to put together a force and advancing on Thessaloniki, middle-ranking pro-junta officers neutralised and arrested his royalist generals and took command of their units, which subsequently put together a force advancing on Kavala to arrest the king. Realising that the countercoup had failed, Constantine fled Greece on board the royal plane, taking his family and hapless premier with him. They landed in [[Rome]] early in the morning of 14 December, where they remained in exile all through the rest of military rule (although he continued as king until 1 June 1973). He was never to return to Greece as a reigning king.

Constantine stated, \"I am sure I shall go back the way my ancestors did.\"<ref name=b1/> The world had changed significantly though since the monarchy had made its last comeback. Constantine continued to watch events from abroad. He said to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'':

<blockquote>I consider myself King of the Hellenes and sole expression of legality in my country until the Greek people freely decide otherwise. I fully expected that the (military) regime would depose me eventually. They are frightened of the Crown because it is a unifying force among the people.<ref name=\"waiting\"/></blockquote>

With Constantine abroad, Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] illegally appointed himself prime-minister and General [[Georgios Zoitakis|George Zoitakis]] as regent.

Over the next year the junta sent intermediaries to the king to negotiate the terms on which he might return to Greece. But Constantine insisted on the full restoration of democracy under the existing constitution as a precondition, and George Papadopoulos would not agree to this. Instead the regime illegally promulgated a new constitution in November 1968, which retained the monarchy, but stripped it of its powers, and provided for a permanent regency until the king chose to accept the new order. This standoff continued until 1972, when George Papadopoulos illegally dismissed [[Georgios Zoitakis|George Zoitakis]] and appointed himself regent.

In June 1973, George Papadopoulos condemned Constantine as \"a collaborator with foreign forces and with murderers\" and accused him of \"pursuing ambitions to become a political leader\".<ref name=\"waiting\" />
In May, officers of the largely royalist navy staged an [[Greek destroyer Velos (D16)|abortive coup]], although Constantine himself was not involved. George Papadopoulos retaliated by declaring Greece a [[republic]] (1 June), a decision which was confirmed by a [[1973 Greek plebiscite|plebiscite]] on 29 July. The vote was widely acknowledged to be rigged. Constantine refused to accept the outcome. George Papadopoulos then declared himself [[President of Greece|president]], but in November there was a coup within the regime and he was replaced by General [[Phaidon Ghizikis]], who was a front for the new military strongman, [[Dimitrios Ioannides]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Restoration of democracy and the referendum==
In July 1974, [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|the events in Cyprus]] led to the downfall of the military regime, and Karamanlis returned from exile to become prime minister. The 1973 republican constitution was regarded as illegitimate, and the new administration issued a constitutional decree restoring the 1952 constitution. Constantine confidently awaited an invitation to return.<ref name=\"waiting\" /> On 24 July he declared his \"deep satisfaction with the initiative of the armed forces in overthrowing the dictatorial regime\" and welcomed the advent of Karamanlis as prime minister.

The former king visited both Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street and openly declared his hope to be shortly returning to Greece. However, the 1952 constitution was not restored with the overthrow of the illegal junta. Following Karamanlis' resounding victory in the November 1974 [[1974 Greek legislative election|parliamentary elections]] (his [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party won 54.4% of the vote), he called a [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum]] (held on 8 December 1974) on whether Greece would restore the monarchy or remain a republic.

Although he had been the leader of the traditionally monarchist right, Karamanlis made no attempt to restore the democratic constitution of 1952. Instead he called on the Greek people to vote \"according to their conscience\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The former king was not allowed by the government to return to Greece to campaign on behalf of the benefits to Greece of the constitutional monarchy. He was only allowed to broadcast to the Greek people from London on television. Analysts claim this was a deliberate act by the government to undermine any chance to restore the monarchy.<ref>[http://www.royalchronicles.gr/1974referendumgreece/ R. Cronicles, The Referendum]</ref>

The left voted overwhelmingly for the republic because the former king was perceived by them as having engaged in political interference far beyond the scope of the monarchical prerogative. They also objected to the perceived influence exercised by members of the royal family who had no constitutional role in the political life of the country; the former king's mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], being a case in point.

The republic received overwhelming support by the centrist voters who condemned Constantine for, among other things, swearing in the junta in 1967. They also blamed his reluctance to sever all ties with the junta once in exile, and the dismissal of the legitimately elected George Papandreou administration ([[Apostasia of 1965]]), the event which some believed led to the coup.

Constantine, speaking from London, freely admitted his past mistakes. He claimed to have sound democratic intentions in the future and promised that his mother would stay away from the country.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> Local monarchists campaigned on his behalf. The vote to restore the monarchy was only about 31%, having most of his support from the [[Peloponnese]] region, with almost 69% of the electorate voting against the restoration of the monarchy and for the establishment of a republic.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> The result was met with  celebrations in the streets of Athens and other major cities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==In exile==
Constantine remained in exile for almost forty years after the vote in favour of the republic.<ref name=\"waiting\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Helena|title=Greece's former king goes home after 46-year exile|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/greece-former-king-exile-constantine-ii-anne-marie|website=The Guardian|accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref> He was strongly discouraged from returning to Greece, and he did not return until February 1981, when the government only allowed him to return for a few hours, to attend the funeral of his mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], in the family cemetery of the former Royal Palace at [[Tatoi]].

There were also legal disputes with the Greek state. In 1992 he concluded an agreement with the conservative government of Prime Minister [[Constantine Mitsotakis]], ceding most of his land in Greece to a non-profit foundation in exchange for the former palace of Tatoi, near Athens, and the right to export a number of movables from Greece. The latter reportedly included privately owned art treasures from the royal palaces. As such, no formal account of what was removed was ever given or needed to be given. In 1993, Constantine visited Greece, but faced with government insecurity, he was asked to leave. In 1994, the second government of [[Andreas Papandreou]] passed new legislation reversing the 1992 agreement and stripping Constantine of his property in Greece and his Greek citizenship.

Constantine sued Greece at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for €500 million in compensation for the seized property. He won a much smaller amount, receiving a monetary compensation of €12 million for the lost property, with a far smaller sum awarded to his unmarried younger sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]], and his aunt [[Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark|Princess Katherine]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Helena Smith|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/29/helenasmith |title=Court deals decisive blow to deposed Greek royals|work=The Guardian|date=29 November 2002|accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref> The Greek government chose to pay out of the \"extraordinary natural disasters\" fund, but was not obliged by the court's decision to return any lands (the Court of Human Rights awards only monetary compensation).

Constantine, in turn, announced the creation of the [[Anna Maria Foundation]], to allocate the funds in question back to the Greek people for use in \"extraordinary natural disasters\" and charitable causes. The court decision also ruled that Constantine's human rights were not violated by the Greek state's decision not to grant him Greek citizenship and passport unless he adopts a [[surname]].

==Later life==
[[File:Former King Constantine & Queen Anne Marie of Greece in Colour.jpg|thumb|Constantine and his wife with their youngest children, Theodora and Philippos, by [[Allan Warren]] c.1986]]
Following the abolition of the monarchy, Constantine has repeatedly stated that he recognizes the Republic, the laws and the constitution of Greece. He told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', \"If the Greek people decide that they want a republic, they are entitled to have that and should be left in peace to enjoy it.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Throneless abroad: The men who would be king\" ''TIME magazine'' (3 June 2002/Vol. 159 No. 22)</ref>

Constantine and [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Anne-Marie]] for many years lived in [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], [[London]], Constantine being a close friend of his second cousin [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and a godfather to [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], his second cousin once removed. After the wedding of their son, Nikolaos, Constantine and Anne-Marie moved back to Greece, currently residing in [[Porto Cheli]], [[Peloponnese]].

In 2004, Constantine was back in Greece temporarily during the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympic Games]] as a member of the International Olympic Committee.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> 
On 24 December 2004, Constantine and Anne-Marie and members of the former royal family visited the [[Presidential Mansion, Athens|Presidential Mansion]] (the former Royal Palace) in Athens where Constantine met [[President of Greece|President]] [[Costis Stephanopoulos]], who gave them a tour.

According to a nationwide 2007 survey of 2,040 households conducted on behalf of the newspaper ''[[To Vima]]'', only 11.6% supported a constitutional monarchy. More than half of the respondents, 50.9%, considered the dictatorship of the junta had brought benefits to Greece.<ref>''The Greeks are looking for a new strong leader'', To Vima, 22 April 2007; https://web.archive.org/web/20070425203217/http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&f=15044&m=A04&aa=1</ref>

During the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London]] Olympics, Constantine, in his role as honorary member of the International Olympic Committee, was the official presenter at the sailing medal ceremonies. He is Co-President of Honour of the [[International Sailing Federation]] with [[King Harald V of Norway]], since 1994.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120217180736/http://www.greekroyalfamily.gr/profile.cfm?ItemID=27&get=family HM KING CONSTANTINE]. greekroyalfamily.gr</ref>

==Titles, styles and honours==

===Titles and styles===
Until 1994, Constantine's official Greek passport identified him as \"Constantine, former King of the Hellenes\". A law passed in 1994 stripped him of his [[Greek citizenship]], [[Greek passport|passport]], and property. The law stated that Constantine could not be granted a Greek passport unless he adopted a surname. He continues to use the title \"King Constantine\", although he no longer uses \"Constantine, King of the Hellenes\". Today, this appellation draws attention to the fact that Constantine and his family lacks a legal surname in Greece.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Constantine has stated: \"I don't have a name—my family doesn't have a name. The law that Mr Papandreou passed basically says that he considers that I am not Greek and that my family was Greek only so long as we were exercising the responsibilities of sovereign, and I had to go out and acquire a name. The problem is that my family originates from Denmark, and the Danish royal family haven't got a surname.\" [[House of Glücksburg|Glücksburg]], he said, was not a family name but the name of [[Glücksburg|a town]]. \"I might as well call myself Mr. [[Kensington]].\"<ref>\"King Without a Country\", ''Vanity Fair'' (July 1995)</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2019}}

Constantine freely travels in and out of Greece on a [[Danish passport]], as ''Constantino de Grecia'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"Constantine of Greece\"),<ref name=\"enet\"/> because Denmark (upon request) issues [[diplomatic passport]]s to any descendants of [[King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]]; and Constantine is a Prince of Denmark in his own right.<ref>[http://www.folketinget.dk/Samling/20001/spor_sv/S3937.htm Question '&#39;'S 3937'&#39;' to the Minister of Justice (11 September 2001)].

Retrieved on 9 April 2016.</ref> During his first visit to Greece using this passport, Constantine was mocked by some of the Greek media, which [[hellenization|hellenized]] the \"de Grecia\" designation and used it as a surname, thus naming him {{lang|el|Κωνσταντίνος Ντεγκρέτσιας}} (\"Constantine Degrecias\").<ref name=\"enet\">{{cite news|first=Αγνή|last=Βραβορίτου|script-title=el:Δεν περνάει η μπογιά του|date=25 April 2003|publisher=Χ.

'''Constantine II''' ({{lang-el|Κωνσταντίνος Βʹ}}, ''Konstantínos II'', {{IPA-el|ˌkonstanˈdinos|pron}}; born 2 June 1940) reigned as the [[List of kings of Greece|King]] of [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]], from 1964 until the abolition of the [[Monarchy of Greece|monarchy]] in 1973.

He acceded as king following the death of his father King [[Paul of Greece|Paul]] in March 1964. Later that year he married [[Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark]] with whom he eventually had five children. Although the accession of the young monarch was initially regarded auspiciously, his reign soon became controversial: Constantine's involvement in the [[Apostasia of 1965|''Apostasia'' of July 1965]] created unrest among sections of the population and aggravated the ongoing political instability that culminated in the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Colonels' Coup of 21 April 1967]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The coup was successful, leaving Constantine, as the [[head of state]], little room to manoeuvre since he had no loyal military forces on which to rely. As a result, he reluctantly agreed to inaugurate the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]] on the condition that it be made up largely of civilian ministers. On 13 December 1967, Constantine was forced to flee the country, following an unsuccessful countercoup against the junta. He remained (formally) the head of state in exile until the junta conducted the 1 June [[1973 Greek republic referendum]] which abolished the monarchy.

This abolition was confirmed after the [[metapolitefsi|fall of the junta]] by the [[1974 Greek republic referendum]] on 8 December, which established the [[Third Hellenic Republic]]. Constantine, who was not allowed to return to Greece to campaign,<ref>Hope, Kevin. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5abf4fe0-04b0-11e1-91d9-00144feabdc0.html Referendum plan faces hurdles].

A referendum on July 29, 1973, confirmed these actions. After the election of a civilian government in November 1974, another referendum on the monarchy was conducted on 8 December. The monarchy was rejected, and Constantine, who had protested the vote of 1973, accepted the result.}}</ref>

Constantine is also a former competitive [[yachting|sailor]] and [[Olympic Games|Olympian]], winning a [[Olympic medal|gold medal]] in the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] in [[Sailing at the 1960 Summer Olympics – Dragon|the Dragon class]], and later serving on the [[International Olympic Committee]].

Constantine was born at the Psychiko Palace in [[Psychiko]], a suburb of  Athens. He was the nephew of [[George II of Greece|King George II]], and also the second child and only son of the king's brother and [[heir presumptive]], [[Paul of Greece|Crown Prince Paul]]. His mother was Princess [[Frederica of Hanover]].<ref name=\"waiting\">{{cite book | author=Curley, W.J.P. | title=Monarchs In Waiting| location=London |publisher=Hutchinson & Co Ltd | year=1975 | isbn=0-09-122310-5 |pages=39–41}}</ref> Constantine's older sister [[Queen Sofía of Spain]] is the wife of the retired King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], while his younger sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]], has never been married.

Constantine was just one year old when [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] [[Battle of Greece|invaded Greece]], and he spent the next four years in exile in [[Egypt]] and [[Cape Town, South Africa]] (where his sister Irene was born) with his family. He returned to Greece with his family in 1946. King George died in 1947, and Constantine's father became the new king, making Constantine the crown prince. He was educated at a preparatory school and later a boarding school (Victoria College of Alexandria, Egypt, where his classmates included King Hussein of Jordan and actor Omar Sharif).<ref name=\"waiting\" /> A fellow student recalled him as \"a good chap, a young man with all the right instincts. He was at his best on the playing fields.\"<ref name=\"waiting\" />

Constantine served in all three branches of the [[Hellenic Armed Forces]], attending the requisite military academies. He also attended the [[NATO]] Air Force Special Weapons School in Germany, as well as the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], where he took courses in the school of law.<ref name=\"waiting\" /> He is an honorable member of the [[International Soling Association]] and honorable President of the [[International Dragon Association]].

Constantine was an able sportsman. In 1960, aged 20, he won an Olympic gold medal in sailing ([[Dragon (keelboat)|dragon class]]), which was the first Greek gold medal in sailing since the Stockholm [[1912 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/medallists-results?athletename=&category=&games=&sport=&event=&mengender=false&womengender=false&mixedgender=false&teamclassification=false&individualclassification=false&continent=1&country=30784&goldmedal=true&silvermedal=false&bronzemedal=false&worldrecord=false&olympicrecord=false&targetresults=true&sortorder=date&resultspageipp=50|title=Olympic Records World Records|publisher=Olympic |accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref> He was also a strong swimmer and had a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[karate]], with interests in [[Squash (sport)|squash]], track events and riding.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> In 1963 Constantine became a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). He resigned in 1974 because he was no longer a Greek resident, and was made an Honorary IOC Member.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ko/crown-prince-konstantinos-1.html Crown Prince Konstantinos]. sports-reference.com</ref>

==Reign==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2014}}
In March 1964, King Paul died of cancer, and the 23-year-old Constantine succeeded him as king. Prior to this, Constantine had already been appointed as [[regent]] for his ailing father.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ailing Greek King Names Son Regent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/21/ailing-greek-king-names-son-regent.html|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=The New York Times|date=21 February 1964}}</ref>

King Paul's long-time prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] regarded him partly responsible for his [[1963 Greek legislative election|fall from leadership in 1963]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

However, due to his youth, he was also perceived as a promise of change. The accession of Constantine coincided with the recent [[1964 Greek legislative election|election]] of [[Center Union|Centrist]] [[George Papandreou, senior|George Papandreou]] as [[Prime Minister of Greece|prime minister]] in February 1964, which ended 11 years of right-wing rule by the [[National Radical Union]] (ERE).

Greece was still feeling the effects of the [[Greek Civil War|Civil War]] of 1944–49 between communists and monarchists, and society was strongly polarised between the royalist/conservative right and the liberal/socialist left. It was hoped that the new young king and the new prime minister would be able to overcome past dissensions.

Initially, relations between the king and Papandreou seemed good, but by 1965, they had deteriorated. The conservative establishment feared the rising influence of Papandreou's left-leaning son [[Andreas Papandreou|Andreas]], and the outbreak of the purported [[ASPIDA scandal|''ASPIDA'' scandal]] seemed to confirm their suspicions. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The name of Andreas Papandreou was implicated in the case, and when the defence minister, Petros Garoufalias tried to form a committee of inquiry into the alleged scandal, the prime minister forced his resignation. Immediately, George Papandreou assigned the defence portfolio to himself, which caused alarm in the palace and the conservative security circles, which interpreted this move as an attempt by Papandreou to control the army. Constantine refused to accept the self-appointment, and a new political issue resulted.

Constantine proposed the appointment of any other person of the prime minister's choosing as defence minister because, as the king argued, there was a conflict of interest: the prime minister's son was allegedly involved in the scandal.

Papandreou rejected the king's proposition, although he had initially shown some willingness to accept it, and submitted his own resignation, stating that it was well within his constitutional powers as the elected prime minister commanding a Parliamentary majority to appoint his ministers at his pleasure, and it was beyond the constitutional powers of the king to refuse him this right. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

A short time after his resignation, Constantine appointed a new government led by [[Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas]], who failed to ensure the [[confidence (politics)|Parliament's confidence]]. This appointment, which became known as the \"Royal Coup\" ({{lang|el|Το Βασιλικό Πραξικόπημα}}), evoked much criticism as being unconstitutional. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

According to the critics, the appointment of this and successive governments consisting of aisle-crossers instead of the proclamation of new elections, caused a constitutional crisis and political instability that lasted for more than two years and led to the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

After his failure, Novas was succeeded by [[Ilias Tsirimokos]], who also failed to form a stable government and was dismissed. Constantine next appointed some of Papandreou's dissidents, known as the [[Apostasia of 1965|July Apostates]] and led by [[Stefanos Stefanopoulos]], to form a government of \"king's men\", which lasted until December 1966, amidst mounting strikes and protests, supported by the right-wing ERE.

When Stefanopoulos resigned in frustration, Constantine appointed a caretaker government under [[Ioannis Paraskevopoulos]], which called elections for May 1967. This government did not even last until the scheduled elections. It was replaced on 3 April 1967 by another caretaker government under the leader of the ERE, [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]].

==Greek dictatorship 1967–1974==
{{BLP sources|date=April 2017|reason=several lines have major [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] issues|section}}Elections were scheduled for 28 May 1967, with expectations of a wide Centrist victory. According to United States diplomat John Day, the Americans worried that, due to the old age of [[Georgios Papandreou|George Papandreou]], [[Andreas Papandreou]] would have a very powerful role in the next government.

According to the United States diplomats Robert Keely and John Owens, who were attached to the United States embassy in Greece at the time, Constantine asked United States Ambassador [[Phillips Talbot]] what the attitude of the United States government would be to an extra-parliamentary solution to this problem. The embassy responded negatively in principle, adding that \"US reaction to such a move cannot be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at time\". To this day, Constantine denies all this. According to then-Ambassador from the United States Phillips Talbot, after this communication, Constantine met with the generals of the army, who promised the king that they would not take any action before the coming elections. However, they were nervous by the proclamations of Andreas Papandreou and reserved to themselves the right to reconsider possible courses of action according to the results of the election.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\">TV documentary \"[http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 ΤΑ ΔΙΚΑ ΜΑΣ 60's – Μέρος 3ο: ΧΑΜΕΝΗ ΑΝΟΙΞΗ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406222452/http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 |date=6 April 2008 }}\" Stelios Kouloglu</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2019}}

A traditionalist, right-wing nationalist group of middle-ranking army officers led by Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] took action first and staged a [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|''coup d'état'' on 21 April]]. The coup leaders met Constantine at his residence in [[Tatoi]], which was surrounded by tanks to prevent resistance. Constantine later recounted that the officers of the tank platoons believed they were carrying out the coup under his orders.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\" /> The king argued with the colonels and initially dismissed them. Later in the day, he went to the Ministry of National Defence, where all coup leaders were gathered, and had a discussion with Kanellopoulos and with leading generals. He agreed to concede to the military demands  and swear the new regime in only when the junta agreed to include a number of civilian politicians, with a royalist nominee, [[Konstantinos Kollias]], as prime minister. [[Panayotis Kanellopoulos]], the last legitimate prime minister of Greece prior to the coup, acting as witness for the [[prosecution]], at the [[Greek junta trials|junta trials]] in 1975 during [[metapolitefsi]], testified how he was arrested by [[Machine gun|machine-gun]] toting soldiers and transported to the palace to meet King Constantine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} He added that during the meeting he urged the king to use his status as [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Military of Greece|Greek military]] to order loyal officers to crush the coup. Constantine apparently refused to do so because he feared bloodshed.<ref name=\"Time Korydallos\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917678,00.html The Colonels on Trial]. ''Time Magazine'' (11 August 1975)</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2019}}

From the outset, the relationship between Constantine and the regime of the colonels was an uneasy one.<ref name=\"b1\">{{cite book | author=Hindley, G | title=The Royal Families of Europe| url=https://archive.org/details/royalfamiliesofe00hind | url-access=registration | location=London |publisher=Lyric Books Ltd | year=1979 | isbn=0-07-093530-0|pages= [https://archive.org/details/royalfamiliesofe00hind/page/126 126–127]}}</ref> Constantine organised a counter-coup, though no help or involvement of the United States was forthcoming. The king finally decided to launch his counter-coup on 13 December 1967. Since Athens was effectively in the hands of the junta militarily, Constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of [[Kavala]], east of [[Thessaloniki]]. There he hoped to be among troops loyal only to him. The vague plan he and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would advance to Thessaloniki (Greece's second biggest city and unofficial capital of northern Greece) and take it. Constantine planned to install an alternative administration there. International recognition, which he believed to be forthcoming, as well as internal pressure from the fact that Greece would have been split into two governments would, the king hoped, force the junta to resign, leaving the field clear for him to return triumphant to Athens.

In the early morning hours of 13 December, the king boarded the royal plane together with [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece]], their two young children, [[Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark|Princess Alexia]] and [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece|Prince Pavlos]], his mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], and his sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]]. Constantine also took with him Premier Kollias. At first things seemed to be going according to plan. Constantine was well received in Kavala which, militarily, was under the command of a general loyal to him. The air force and navy, both strongly royalist and not involved in the 1967 coup, immediately declared for him and mobilised. Another of Constantine's generals effectively cut all communication between Athens and the north. However, the king's plans were overly bureaucratic, naïvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be followed. Further, the king was obsessive about avoiding \"bloodshed\" even where the junta would be the attacker.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Under these circumstances, rather than managing to put together a force and advancing on Thessaloniki, middle-ranking pro-junta officers neutralised and arrested his royalist generals and took command of their units, which subsequently put together a force advancing on Kavala to arrest the king. Realising that the countercoup had failed, Constantine fled Greece on board the royal plane, taking his family and hapless premier with him. They landed in [[Rome]] early in the morning of 14 December, where they remained in exile all through the rest of military rule (although he continued as king until 1 June 1973). He was never to return to Greece as a reigning king.

Constantine stated, \"I am sure I shall go back the way my ancestors did.\"<ref name=b1/> The world had changed significantly though since the monarchy had made its last comeback. Constantine continued to watch events from abroad. He said to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'':

<blockquote>I consider myself King of the Hellenes and sole expression of legality in my country until the Greek people freely decide otherwise. I fully expected that the (military) regime would depose me eventually. They are frightened of the Crown because it is a unifying force among the people.<ref name=\"waiting\"/></blockquote>

With Constantine abroad, Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] illegally appointed himself prime-minister and General [[Georgios Zoitakis|George Zoitakis]] as regent.

Over the next year the junta sent intermediaries to the king to negotiate the terms on which he might return to Greece. But Constantine insisted on the full restoration of democracy under the existing constitution as a precondition, and George Papadopoulos would not agree to this. Instead the regime illegally promulgated a new constitution in November 1968, which retained the monarchy, but stripped it of its powers, and provided for a permanent regency until the king chose to accept the new order. This standoff continued until 1972, when George Papadopoulos illegally dismissed [[Georgios Zoitakis|George Zoitakis]] and appointed himself regent.

In June 1973, George Papadopoulos condemned Constantine as \"a collaborator with foreign forces and with murderers\" and accused him of \"pursuing ambitions to become a political leader\".<ref name=\"waiting\" />
In May, officers of the largely royalist navy staged an [[Greek destroyer Velos (D16)|abortive coup]], although Constantine himself was not involved. George Papadopoulos retaliated by declaring Greece a [[republic]] (1 June), a decision which was confirmed by a [[1973 Greek plebiscite|plebiscite]] on 29 July. The vote was widely acknowledged to be rigged. Constantine refused to accept the outcome. George Papadopoulos then declared himself [[President of Greece|president]], but in November there was a coup within the regime and he was replaced by General [[Phaidon Ghizikis]], who was a front for the new military strongman, [[Dimitrios Ioannides]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Restoration of democracy and the referendum==
In July 1974, [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|the events in Cyprus]] led to the downfall of the military regime, and Karamanlis returned from exile to become prime minister. The 1973 republican constitution was regarded as illegitimate, and the new administration issued a constitutional decree restoring the 1952 constitution. Constantine confidently awaited an invitation to return.<ref name=\"waiting\" /> On 24 July he declared his \"deep satisfaction with the initiative of the armed forces in overthrowing the dictatorial regime\" and welcomed the advent of Karamanlis as prime minister.

The former king visited both Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street and openly declared his hope to be shortly returning to Greece. However, the 1952 constitution was not restored with the overthrow of the illegal junta. Following Karamanlis' resounding victory in the November 1974 [[1974 Greek legislative election|parliamentary elections]] (his [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party won 54.4% of the vote), he called a [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum]] (held on 8 December 1974) on whether Greece would restore the monarchy or remain a republic.

Although he had been the leader of the traditionally monarchist right, Karamanlis made no attempt to restore the democratic constitution of 1952. Instead he called on the Greek people to vote \"according to their conscience\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The former king was not allowed by the government to return to Greece to campaign on behalf of the benefits to Greece of the constitutional monarchy. He was only allowed to broadcast to the Greek people from London on television. Analysts claim this was a deliberate act by the government to undermine any chance to restore the monarchy.<ref>[http://www.royalchronicles.gr/1974referendumgreece/ R. Cronicles, The Referendum]</ref>

The left voted overwhelmingly for the republic because the former king was perceived by them as having engaged in political interference far beyond the scope of the monarchical prerogative. They also objected to the perceived influence exercised by members of the royal family who had no constitutional role in the political life of the country; the former king's mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], being a case in point.

The republic received overwhelming support by the centrist voters who condemned Constantine for, among other things, swearing in the junta in 1967. They also blamed his reluctance to sever all ties with the junta once in exile, and the dismissal of the legitimately elected George Papandreou administration ([[Apostasia of 1965]]), the event which some believed led to the coup.

Constantine, speaking from London, freely admitted his past mistakes. He claimed to have sound democratic intentions in the future and promised that his mother would stay away from the country.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> Local monarchists campaigned on his behalf. The vote to restore the monarchy was only about 31%, having most of his support from the [[Peloponnese]] region, with almost 69% of the electorate voting against the restoration of the monarchy and for the establishment of a republic.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> The result was met with  celebrations in the streets of Athens and other major cities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==In exile==
Constantine remained in exile for almost forty years after the vote in favour of the republic.<ref name=\"waiting\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Helena|title=Greece's former king goes home after 46-year exile|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/greece-former-king-exile-constantine-ii-anne-marie|website=The Guardian|accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref> He was strongly discouraged from returning to Greece, and he did not return until February 1981, when the government only allowed him to return for a few hours, to attend the funeral of his mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], in the family cemetery of the former Royal Palace at [[Tatoi]].

There were also legal disputes with the Greek state. In 1992 he concluded an agreement with the conservative government of Prime Minister [[Constantine Mitsotakis]], ceding most of his land in Greece to a non-profit foundation in exchange for the former palace of Tatoi, near Athens, and the right to export a number of movables from Greece. The latter reportedly included privately owned art treasures from the royal palaces. As such, no formal account of what was removed was ever given or needed to be given. In 1993, Constantine visited Greece, but faced with government insecurity, he was asked to leave. In 1994, the second government of [[Andreas Papandreou]] passed new legislation reversing the 1992 agreement and stripping Constantine of his property in Greece and his Greek citizenship.

Constantine sued Greece at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for €500 million in compensation for the seized property. He won a much smaller amount, receiving a monetary compensation of €12 million for the lost property, with a far smaller sum awarded to his unmarried younger sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]], and his aunt [[Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark|Princess Katherine]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Helena Smith|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/29/helenasmith |title=Court deals decisive blow to deposed Greek royals|work=The Guardian|date=29 November 2002|accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref> The Greek government chose to pay out of the \"extraordinary natural disasters\" fund, but was not obliged by the court's decision to return any lands (the Court of Human Rights awards only monetary compensation).

Constantine, in turn, announced the creation of the [[Anna Maria Foundation]], to allocate the funds in question back to the Greek people for use in \"extraordinary natural disasters\" and charitable causes. The court decision also ruled that Constantine's human rights were not violated by the Greek state's decision not to grant him Greek citizenship and passport unless he adopts a [[surname]].

==Later life==
[[File:Former King Constantine & Queen Anne Marie of Greece in Colour.jpg|thumb|Constantine and his wife with their youngest children, Theodora and Philippos, by [[Allan Warren]] c.1986]]
Following the abolition of the monarchy, Constantine has repeatedly stated that he recognizes the Republic, the laws and the constitution of Greece. He told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', \"If the Greek people decide that they want a republic, they are entitled to have that and should be left in peace to enjoy it.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Throneless abroad: The men who would be king\" ''TIME magazine'' (3 June 2002/Vol. 159 No. 22)</ref>

Constantine and [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Anne-Marie]] for many years lived in [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], [[London]], Constantine being a close friend of his second cousin [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and a godfather to [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], his second cousin once removed. After the wedding of their son, Nikolaos, Constantine and Anne-Marie moved back to Greece, currently residing in [[Porto Cheli]], [[Peloponnese]].

In 2004, Constantine was back in Greece temporarily during the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympic Games]] as a member of the International Olympic Committee.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> 
On 24 December 2004, Constantine and Anne-Marie and members of the former royal family visited the [[Presidential Mansion, Athens|Presidential Mansion]] (the former Royal Palace) in Athens where Constantine met [[President of Greece|President]] [[Costis Stephanopoulos]], who gave them a tour.

According to a nationwide 2007 survey of 2,040 households conducted on behalf of the newspaper ''[[To Vima]]'', only 11.6% supported a constitutional monarchy. More than half of the respondents, 50.9%, considered the dictatorship of the junta had brought benefits to Greece.<ref>''The Greeks are looking for a new strong leader'', To Vima, 22 April 2007; https://web.archive.org/web/20070425203217/http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&f=15044&m=A04&aa=1</ref>

During the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London]] Olympics, Constantine, in his role as honorary member of the International Olympic Committee, was the official presenter at the sailing medal ceremonies. He is Co-President of Honour of the [[International Sailing Federation]] with [[King Harald V of Norway]], since 1994.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120217180736/http://www.greekroyalfamily.gr/profile.cfm?ItemID=27&get=family HM KING CONSTANTINE]. greekroyalfamily.gr</ref>

==Titles, styles and honours==

===Titles and styles===
Until 1994, Constantine's official Greek passport identified him as \"Constantine, former King of the Hellenes\". A law passed in 1994 stripped him of his [[Greek citizenship]], [[Greek passport|passport]], and property. The law stated that Constantine could not be granted a Greek passport unless he adopted a surname. He continues to use the title \"King Constantine\", although he no longer uses \"Constantine, King of the Hellenes\". Today, this appellation draws attention to the fact that Constantine and his family lacks a legal surname in Greece.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Constantine has stated: \"I don't have a name—my family doesn't have a name. The law that Mr Papandreou passed basically says that he considers that I am not Greek and that my family was Greek only so long as we were exercising the responsibilities of sovereign, and I had to go out and acquire a name. The problem is that my family originates from Denmark, and the Danish royal family haven't got a surname.\" [[House of Glücksburg|Glücksburg]], he said, was not a family name but the name of [[Glücksburg|a town]]. \"I might as well call myself Mr. [[Kensington]].\"<ref>\"King Without a Country\", ''Vanity Fair'' (July 1995)</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2019}}

Constantine freely travels in and out of Greece on a [[Danish passport]], as ''Constantino de Grecia'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"Constantine of Greece\"),<ref name=\"enet\"/> because Denmark (upon request) issues [[diplomatic passport]]s to any descendants of [[King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]]; and Constantine is a Prince of Denmark in his own right.<ref>[http://www.folketinget.dk/Samling/20001/spor_sv/S3937.htm Question '&#39;'S 3937'&#39;' to the Minister of Justice (11 September 2001)]. Folketinget.dk. Retrieved on 9 April 2016.</ref> During his first visit to Greece using this passport, Constantine was mocked by some of the Greek media, which [[hellenization|hellenized]] the \"de Grecia\" designation and used it as a surname, thus naming him {{lang|el|Κωνσταντίνος Ντεγκρέτσιας}} (\"Constantine Degrecias\").<ref name=\"enet\">{{cite news|first=Αγνή|last=Βραβορίτου|script-title=el:Δεν περνάει η μπογιά του|date=25 April 2003|publisher=Χ.

'''Richard Nathaniel Wright''' (September 4, 1908&nbsp;– November 28, 1960) was an American author of novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction. Much of his literature concerns racial themes, especially related to the plight of African Americans during the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, who suffered discrimination and violence in the South and the North. Literary critics believe his work helped change [[race relations in the United States]] in the mid-20th century.<ref>Alan Wald, [http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2031 \"On Richard Wright's Centennial: The Great Outsider\"], Solidarity.</ref>

Each of his grandfathers had taken part in the U.S. Civil War and gained freedom through service: his paternal grandfather Nathan Wright (1842–1904) had served in the 28th [[United States Colored Troops]]; his maternal grandfather Richard Wilson (1847–1921) escaped from slavery in the South to serve in the [[US Navy]] as a [[Landsman (rank)|Landsman]] in April 1865.<ref>[https://civilwartalk.com/threads/richard-wilson-aka-richard-vincent.97026/#post-832592 Summary of Richard Wilson and Nathan Wrights Civil War services at Civil War Talk Forum accessed May 5,2019]</ref>

Richard's father left the family when Richard was six years old, and he did not see Richard for 25 years. In 1911 or 1912 Ella moved to [[Natchez, Mississippi]] to be with her parents. While living in his grandparents' home he accidentally set the house on fire. Wright's mother was so mad that she beat him until he was unconscious.<ref name=childhood>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/mississippi-writers/richard-wright|title=Richard Wright|website=Mississippi Writers & Musicians|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref name=fire>{{Cite web|url=http://blackhistorynow.com/richard-wright/|title=Richard Wright|website=BlackHistoryNow|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> In 1915 Ella put her sons in Settlement House, a [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[orphanage]], for a short time.<ref name=childhood/><ref name=abuse>{{Cite web|url=http://blackboy.pbworks.com/w/page/59555846/Say%20Hello%20To%20Richard%20Wright|title=The Entire Life Story of Richard Wright in Context|website=PBworks|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> In 1916 his mother moved with Richard and his younger brother to live with her sister Maggie (Wilson) and Maggie's husband Silas Hoskins (born 1882) in [[Elaine, Arkansas]].

The Wrights were forced to flee after Silas Hoskins \"disappeared,\" reportedly  killed by a white man who coveted his successful saloon business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3755|title=Richard Nathaniel Wright (1908–1960) – Encyclopedia of Arkansas|author=|date=|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> After his mother became incapacitated by a stroke, Richard was separated from his younger brother and lived briefly with his uncle Clark Wilson and aunt Jodie in Greenwood, Mississippi.<ref name=life/> At the age of 12, he had not yet had a single complete year of schooling. He was, however, enrolled at [[Howe Institute]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] from 1915 to 1916.<ref name=life/> Soon Richard with his younger brother and  mother returned to the home of his maternal grandmother, which was now in the state capital, [[Jackson, Mississippi]], where he lived from early 1920 until late 1925. His grandparents, still mad at him for destroying their house, repeatedly beat Wright and his brother.<ref name=fire/> But while he lived there, he was finally able to attend school regularly. He attended the local Seventh-day Adventist school from 1920 to 1921, with his aunt Addie as his teacher.<ref name=life/><ref name=childhood/> After a year, at the age of 13 he entered the Jim Hill public school in 1921, where he was promoted to sixth grade after only two weeks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 135–138 |url= }}</ref> In his grandparents' [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] home, Richard was miserable, largely because his controlling aunt and grandmother tried to force him to pray to [[God]]. Wright later threatened to move out of his grandmother's home when she would not allow him to work on [[Saturday]]s. His aunt's and grandparents' overbearing attempts to control caused him to permanently hate [[Christians|Christian]]s and their works.<ref name=abuse/>

At the age of 15, while in eighth grade, Wright published his first story, \"The Voodoo of Hell's Half-Acre,\" in the local Black newspaper ''Southern Register.'' No copies survive.<ref name=\"Rayson2\"/> In Chapter 7 of ''Black Boy'', he described the story as about a villain who sought a widow's home.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher= Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 182–186 |url= }}</ref>

After excelling in grade school and junior high, in 1923, Wright earned the position of class [[valedictorian]] of Smith Robertson Junior High School from which he graduated in May 1925.<ref name=\"Rayson2\"/><ref name=life/> He was assigned to write a paper to be delivered at graduation in a public auditorium. Later, he was called to the principal's office, where the principal gave him a prepared speech to present in place of his own. Richard challenged the principal, saying \"the people are coming to hear the students, and I won't make a speech that you've written.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 193–197 |url= }}</ref> The principal threatened him, suggesting that Richard might not be allowed to graduate if he persisted, despite his having passed all the examinations. He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an [[Uncle Tom]], Richard refused to deliver the principal's address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. The principal put pressure on one of Richard's uncles to speak to the boy and get him to change his mind, but Richard continued to be adamant about presenting his own speech, and refused to let his uncle edit it. Despite pressure even from his classmates, Richard delivered his speech as he had planned.

In September that year, Wright registered for mathematics, English, and history courses at the new [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]], constructed for black students in Jackson—the state's schools were segregated under its Jim Crow laws—but he had to stop attending classes after a few weeks of irregular attendance because he needed to earn money for family expenses.<ref name=\"Rayson3\">Rayson, Ann. \"Richard Wright's Life.\" [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/r_wright/wright_life.htm Modern American Poetry]. Nelson, Cary and Brinkman, Bartholomew, eds. Department of English.</ref>

The next year, in November of 1925 at the age of 17, Wright moved on his own to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He planned to have his mother come to live with him when he could support her, and in 1926, his mother and younger brother did rejoin him. Shortly thereafter, Richard resolved to leave the [[Jim Crow economy|Jim Crow South]] and go to Chicago.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 276–278|url= }}</ref> His family joined the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when tens of thousands of blacks left the South to seek opportunities in the more economically prosperous northern and mid-western industrial cities.

Wright's childhood in Mississippi, as well as in Memphis, Tennessee, and Elaine, Arkansas, shaped his lasting impressions of American racism.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black Boy |last=Wright |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |location=New York |isbn=0-06-081250-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig/page/455 455]–459 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig |url-access=registration }}</ref>

=== Coming of age in Chicago ===

Wright and his family moved to Chicago in 1927. After securing employment as a United States postal clerk, during his time off, he read other writers and studied their styles. When he was fired from the post office during the [[Great Depression]], Wright was forced to go [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|on relief]] in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the [[John Reed Club]]. As the club was dominated by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], Wright established a relationship with several party members. Especially interested in the literary contacts made at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote numerous proletarian poems (\"We of the Red Leaves of Red Books\", for example), for ''[[The New Masses]]'' and other [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |first= Richard |authorlink= |editor= Crossman, Richard |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |publisher= [[Bantam Books]] |location= New York |language= |pages= 109–10 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>

By 1935, Wright had completed the manuscript of his first novel, ''Cesspool'', which was published posthumously as ''Lawd Today'' (1963). In January 1936 his story \"Big Boy Leaves Home\" was accepted for publication in ''New Caravan.'' In February of that year, he began working with the [[National Negro Congress]]. In April he chaired the [[South Side Writers Group]], whose members included [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Margaret Walker]]. Wright submitted some of his critical essays and poetry to the group for criticism and read aloud some of his short stories. Through the club, he edited ''Left Front,'' a magazine that the Communist Party shut down in 1937, despite Wright's repeated protests.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 121 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Throughout this period, Wright continued to contribute to ''The New Masses'' magazine.

Pleased by his positive relations with white Communists in Chicago, Wright was later humiliated in New York City by some white party members who rescinded an offer to find housing for him when they learned his race.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 123–26 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>  Some black Communists denounced Wright as a \"[[bourgeois]] intellectual.\"  Wright was essentially [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]]. He had been forced to end his public education after completing junior high school to support his mother and brother.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965|pages= 13–16 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= }}</ref>

Wright insisted that young communist writers be given space to cultivate their talents.  He had developed a working relationship with a [[black nationalist]] communist, which, along with his dissatisfaction with the attitudes of and restrictions imposed by those in the party, led to a public falling out with the party and a number of its leading members. Wright later described this episode through his fictional character Buddy Nealson, [[The Communist Party and African-Americans|an African-American communist]] in his essay \"I tried to be a Communist\", published in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in 1944. This text was an excerpt of his autobiography scheduled to be published as ''American Hunger'', but removed from the actual publication of ''[[Black Boy]]'' upon request by the [[Book of the Month Club]].<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman|title= The God That Failed |year= 1960 |pages= 126–34 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}. It remained an essay until the publication of ''American Hunger'' in 1977 and the complete ''Black Boy (American Hunger)'' in 1991. James Zeigler: ''Red Scare Racism and Cold War Black Radicalism''. Jackson: Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2015, pp. 72–73.</ref> Indeed, his relations with the party turned violent; Wright was threatened at knife point by [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveler]] co-workers, denounced as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] in the street by strikers, and physically assaulted by former comrades when he tried to join them during the 1936 [[May Day]] march.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= |title=The God That Failed |year=1965 |pages=143–45 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>

==Career==

In 1937, Wright moved to New York, where he forged new ties with some Communist Party members. He worked on the [[Federal Writers' Project]] guidebook to the city, ''New York Panorama'' (1938), and wrote the book's essay on [[Harlem]]. Wright became the Harlem editor of the ''[[Daily Worker]],'' a Communist newspaper. Through the summer and fall he wrote more than 200 articles for the ''Daily Worker'' and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine ''New Challenge.'' The year was also a landmark for Wright because he met and developed a friendship with writer [[Ralph Ellison]] that would last for years. He was awarded the ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine first prize of $500 for his short story \"Fire and Cloud\".<ref name=\"story\" />

After receiving the ''Story'' prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of ''Lawd Today'' and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher [[Harper & Row|Harper]] all of Wright's prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.

Wright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled ''[[Uncle Tom's Children]]'' (1938). He based some stories on [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] in the [[Deep South]]. The publication and favorable reception of ''Uncle Tom's Children'' improved Wright's status with the Communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of ''New Masses.'' [[Granville Hicks]], a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel ''[[Native Son]],'' which he published in 1940.

Based on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete ''Native Son.'' During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent [[Communists]] whom Wright had known in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T6-lhNKL3ncC&pg=PT147&dq=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton#v=onepage&q=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton&f=false|title=Literary Brooklyn: The Writers of Brooklyn and the Story of American City Life|first=Evan|last=Hughes|date=August 16, 2011|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=September 30, 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781429973069}}</ref> They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in [[Brooklyn]] in the [[Fort Greene Historic District|Fort Greene]] neighborhood.<ref>Oleksinski, Johnny.

After publication, ''Native Son'' was selected by the [[Book of the Month Club]] as its first book by an African-American author. It was a daring choice. The lead character, Bigger Thomas, was a person bound by the limitations that society placed on African Americans. He gained his own [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts.

Wright was criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of ''Native Son,'' people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of ''Native Son'' was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by [[Edwin Rosskam]]. While in Chicago he visited the ''American Negro Exhibition'' with [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Claude McKay]].
[[File:Canada-Lee-Native-Son-1941.jpg|thumb|[[Canada Lee]] as Bigger Thomas in the [[Orson Welles]] production of ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' (1941)]]
He traveled to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], to collaborate with playwright [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''Native Son.'' In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious [[Spingarn Medal]] of the [[NAACP]] for noteworthy achievement. His play ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' opened on Broadway in March 1941, with [[Orson Welles]] as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the [[Farm Security Administration]]. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, ''Twelve Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States,'' was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.

Wright's memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945) described his early life from [[Roxie, Mississippi|Roxie]] up until his move to Chicago at age 19. It included his clashes with [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. ''American Hunger'', which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of ''Black Boy.'' The [[Library of America]] edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.

''American Hunger'' detailed Wright's participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implied he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In the book's restored form, Wright used the [[diptych]] structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned \"bourgeois\" books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] in the [[Soviet Union]], but he continued to believe in far-left democratic solutions to political problems.

He became a permanent American [[expatriate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/wright/wright_bio.html|title=Richard Wright Biography|author=|date=|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref>

In Paris, he became friends with French writers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]], even though, as Michel Fabre argues, Wright's existentialist leanings were more influenced by [[Soren Kierkegaard]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and especially [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref>Fabre, Michel (1993). ''The Unfinished Quest of Richard Wright.'' pp. 374</ref> In following Fabre's argument, with respect to Wright's existentialist proclivities during the period of 1946 to 1951, Hue Woodson suggests that Wright's exposure to Husserl and Heidegger \"directly came as an intended consequence of the inadequacies of Sartre's synthesis of [[existentialism]] and [[Marxism]] for Wright.\"<ref>Woodson, Hue (2019). \"Heidegger and ''The Outsider,'' ''Savage Holiday,'' and ''The Long Dream''\" in ''Critical Insights: Richard Wright,'' Ed. Kimberly Drake. p. 62</ref>  His [[Existentialist]] phase was expressed in his second novel, ''[[The Outsider (Richard Wright)|The Outsider]]'' (1953), which described an African-American character's involvement with the Communist Party in New York. He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers [[Chester Himes]] and [[James Baldwin]]. His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel\" (collected in ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]''), in which he criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published ''Savage Holiday.''

After becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology ''[[The God That Failed]];'' his essay had been published in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of ''Black Boy.'' He was invited to join the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the [[CIA]]. Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the [[FBI]] had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as the teenager Bigger Thomas (Wright was 42) in an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] film version of ''[[Native Son (1951 film)|Native Son]].''

In mid-1953, Wright traveled to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], where [[Kwame Nkrumah]] was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as [[Ghana]]. Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in [[Accra]] on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the [[U.S. Department of State|US State Department]]. The officer's report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah adviser [[George Padmore]] about Nkrumah's plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a [[Trinidad]]ian living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale's Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright's book on his African journey, ''[[Black Power (Richard Wright book)|Black Power]],'' was published in 1954; its London publisher was [[Dennis Dobson]], who also published Padmore's work.<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause'' (2009), pp. 125–28.</ref>

Whatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer [[Addison Gayle]], a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the [[Smith Act]].<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement'' (2001), p. 82.</ref>

Historian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the [[civil rights movement]] during the 1950s in the United States. She found that Wright was under what his friend Chester Himes called \"extraordinary pressure\" to avoid writing about the US.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> As ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine delayed publishing his essay, \"I Choose Exile,\" Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical. He believed that \"a white periodical would be less vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.\"<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> He thought the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' was interested, but in the end, the piece went unpublished.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\">Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds'', pp. 80–81.</ref><ref>[http://thisissoulone.tumblr.com/post/21392983785/richard-wright-i-choose-exile-i-am-a-native The essay \"I Choose Exile\" Online published accessed August 5,2018]</ref>

In 1955, Wright visited [[Indonesia]] for the [[Bandung Conference]]. He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in ''[[The Color Curtain|The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference]].'' Wright was enthusiastic about the possibilities posed by this meeting of newly independent, former colonial nations. He gave at least two lectures to Indonesian cultural groups, including [[PEN Club]] Indonesia, and he interviewed Indonesian artists and intellectuals in preparation to write ''The Color Curtain.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Brian|title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|pages=153–153, 161}}</ref> Several Indonesian artists and intellectuals whom  Wright met, later commented on how he had depicted Indonesian cultural conditions in his [[travel writing]].<!-- saying what? he got it or did not? --><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vuyk|first=Beb|title=A Weekend with Richard Wright|journal=PMLA|date=May 2011|volume=126|issue=3|pages=810|doi=10.1632/pmla.2011.126.3.798}}</ref>

Other works by Richard Wright included ''White Man, Listen!'' (1957); a novel ''The Long Dream'' (1958), which was adapted as a play and produced in New York in 1960 by [[Ketti Frings]]. It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0904.html \"Richard Wright, Writer, 52, Dies\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 30, 1960.</ref> A collection of [[short story|short stories]], ''Eight Men,'' was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright's  death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.

His agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright's 400-page ''Island of Hallucinations'' manuscript in February 1959. Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.

On June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of ''White Man, Listen!,'' Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of [[amoebic dysentery]], probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959 his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright's illness and \"four hassles in twelve days\" with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.

On February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of ''The Long Dream'' received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get ''The Long Dream'' published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of ''Island of Hallucinations,'' for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from [[Doubleday and Sons]].

In June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia's move from London to Paris to attend the [[Sorbonne]], Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.

In spite of his financial straits, Wright refused to compromise his principles. He declined to participate in a series of programs for Canadian radio because he suspected American control. For the same reason, he rejected an invitation from the Congress for Cultural Freedom to go to India to speak at a conference in memory of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Still interested in literature, Wright helped [[Kyle Onstott]] get his novel ''[[Mandingo (novel)|Mandingo]]'' (1957) published in France.

Wright's last display of explosive energy occurred on November 8, 1960, in his polemical lecture, \"The Situation of the Black Artist and Intellectual in the United States,\" delivered to students and members of the [[American Church in Paris]]. He argued that American society reduced the most militant members of the black community to slaves whenever they wanted to question the racial status quo. He offered as proof the subversive attacks of the Communists against ''Native Son'' and the quarrels which [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and other authors sought with him. On November 26, 1960, Wright talked enthusiastically with Langston Hughes about his work ''Daddy Goodness'' and gave him the manuscript.

He died in Paris on November 28, 1960, of a [[heart attack]] at the age of 52. He was interred in [[Le Père Lachaise Cemetery]]. Wright's daughter Julia has claimed that her father was murdered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rwright.htm |title=Richard Wright |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518164622/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rwright.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

A number of Wright's works have been published posthumously. In addition, some of Wright's more shocking passages dealing with race, sex, and politics were cut or omitted before original publication of works during his lifetime. In 1991, unexpurgated versions of ''Native Son,'' ''Black Boy,'' and his other works were published. In addition, in 1994, his novella ''Rite of Passage'' was published for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/children-s-books-black-history-bookshelf.html |title=Children's Books/Black History; Bookshelf |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 13, 1994}}</ref>

In the last years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form [[Haiku in English|haiku]] and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was published (''Haiku: This Other World'') with 817 of his own favorite haikus. Many of these haikus have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.

A collection of Wright's travel writings was published by [[Mississippi University Press]] in 2001. At his death, Wright left an unfinished book, ''A Father's Law,''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/Powers-t.html?_r=0 |title=Ambiguities |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 24, 2008}}</ref> dealing with a black policeman and the son he suspects of murder. His daughter Julia Wright published ''A Father's Law'' in January 2008. An omnibus edition containing Wright's political works was published under the title ''Three Books from Exile: Black Power; The Color Curtain; and White Man, Listen!''

During the 1950s Wright grew more internationalist in outlook. While he accomplished much as an important public literary and political figure with a worldwide reputation, his creative work did decline.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/s_z/r_wright/r_wright.htm |title= Richard Wright (1908–1960) |accessdate=2008-10-07 |last= Mullen |first= Bill |date= |work= Modern American Poetry |publisher= [[University of Illinois]] }}</ref>

While interest in ''Black Boy'' ebbed during the 1950s, this has remained one of his best selling books. Since the late 20th century, critics have had a resurgence of interest in it. ''Black Boy'' remains a vital work of historical, sociological, and literary significance whose seminal portrayal of one black man's search for self-actualization in a racist society strongly influenced the works of African-American writers who followed, such as [[James Baldwin]] and [[Ralph Ellison]].

It is generally agreed that the influence of Wright's ''Native Son'' is not a matter of literary style or technique.{{sfn|Corkery|2007|pp=17–28}} Rather, in this book affected ideas and attitudes, and ''Native Son'' has been a force in the social and intellectual history of the United States in the last half of the 20th century. \"Wright was one of the people who made me conscious of the need to struggle,\" said writer [[Amiri Baraka]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.itvs.org/RichardWright/more_info.html |title= Richard Wright – Black Boy |accessdate=2008-10-07 |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Independent Television Service]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080715231354/http://www.itvs.org/RichardWright/more_info.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-15}}</ref>

During the 1970s and 1980s, scholars published critical essays about Wright in prestigious journals. Richard Wright conferences were held on university campuses from Mississippi to New Jersey. A new film version of ''Native Son,'' with a screenplay by [[Richard Wesley]], was released in December 1986. Certain Wright novels became required reading in a number of American high schools, universities and colleges.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/10748/Richard_Wright/index.aspx|title= Richard Wright |accessdate=2008-10-07 |website= |publisher= [[Harper Collins]] |date= }}</ref>

\"Recent critics have called for a reassessment of Wright's later work in view of his philosophical project. Notably, [[Paul Gilroy]] has argued that 'the depth of his philosophical interests has been either overlooked or misconceived by the almost exclusively literary inquiries that have dominated analysis of his writing.'\"<ref>Sarah Relyea, ''Outsider Citizens'' (New York: Routledge, 2006): 62. Paul Gilroy, ''The Black Atlantic'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993), 147.</ref> \"His most significant contribution, however, was his desire to accurately portray blacks to white readers, thereby destroying the white myth of the patient, humorous, subservient black man.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/english/ms-writers/dir/wright_richard/ |title= Richard Wright |accessdate=2008-10-07 |last= Duffus |first= Matthew |date= 1999-01-26|work= The Mississippi Writers Page |publisher= [[University of Mississippi]] }}</ref>

'''Richard Nathaniel Wright''' (September 4, 1908&nbsp;– November 28, 1960) was an American author of novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction. Much of his literature concerns racial themes, especially related to the plight of African Americans during the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, who suffered discrimination and violence in the South and the North. Literary critics believe his work helped change [[race relations in the United States]] in the mid-20th century.<ref>Alan Wald, [http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2031 \"On Richard Wright's Centennial: The Great Outsider\"], Solidarity.</ref>

=== Childhood in the South ===
Richard Nathaniel Wright was born on September 4, 1908 at Rucker's Plantation, between the train town of Roxie and the larger river city of [[Natchez, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"Rayson2\">Rayson, Ann. \"Richard Wright's Life.\" [https://www.modernamericanpoetry.org ''Modern American Poetry''], Nelson, Cary and Brinkman, Bartholomew, eds.

Each of his grandfathers had taken part in the U.S. Civil War and gained freedom through service: his paternal grandfather Nathan Wright (1842–1904) had served in the 28th [[United States Colored Troops]]; his maternal grandfather Richard Wilson (1847–1921) escaped from slavery in the South to serve in the [[US Navy]] as a [[Landsman (rank)|Landsman]] in April 1865.<ref>[https://civilwartalk.com/threads/richard-wilson-aka-richard-vincent.97026/#post-832592 Summary of Richard Wilson and Nathan Wrights Civil War services at Civil War Talk Forum accessed May 5,2019]</ref>

Richard's father left the family when Richard was six years old, and he did not see Richard for 25 years. In 1911 or 1912 Ella moved to [[Natchez, Mississippi]] to be with her parents. While living in his grandparents' home he accidentally set the house on fire. Wright's mother was so mad that she beat him until he was unconscious.<ref name=childhood>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/mississippi-writers/richard-wright|title=Richard Wright|website=Mississippi Writers & Musicians|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref name=fire>{{Cite web|url=http://blackhistorynow.com/richard-wright/|title=Richard Wright|website=BlackHistoryNow|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> In 1915 Ella put her sons in Settlement House, a [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[orphanage]], for a short time.<ref name=childhood/><ref name=abuse>{{Cite web|url=http://blackboy.pbworks.com/w/page/59555846/Say%20Hello%20To%20Richard%20Wright|title=The Entire Life Story of Richard Wright in Context|website=PBworks|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> In 1916 his mother moved with Richard and his younger brother to live with her sister Maggie (Wilson) and Maggie's husband Silas Hoskins (born 1882) in [[Elaine, Arkansas]]. This part of Arkansas was in the [[Mississippi Delta]] where former cotton plantations had been. The Wrights were forced to flee after Silas Hoskins \"disappeared,\" reportedly  killed by a white man who coveted his successful saloon business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3755|title=Richard Nathaniel Wright (1908–1960) – Encyclopedia of Arkansas|author=|date=|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> After his mother became incapacitated by a stroke, Richard was separated from his younger brother and lived briefly with his uncle Clark Wilson and aunt Jodie in Greenwood, Mississippi.<ref name=life/> At the age of 12, he had not yet had a single complete year of schooling. He was, however, enrolled at [[Howe Institute]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] from 1915 to 1916.<ref name=life/> Soon Richard with his younger brother and  mother returned to the home of his maternal grandmother, which was now in the state capital, [[Jackson, Mississippi]], where he lived from early 1920 until late 1925. His grandparents, still mad at him for destroying their house, repeatedly beat Wright and his brother.<ref name=fire/> But while he lived there, he was finally able to attend school regularly. He attended the local Seventh-day Adventist school from 1920 to 1921, with his aunt Addie as his teacher.<ref name=life/><ref name=childhood/> After a year, at the age of 13 he entered the Jim Hill public school in 1921, where he was promoted to sixth grade after only two weeks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 135–138 |url= }}</ref> In his grandparents' [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] home, Richard was miserable, largely because his controlling aunt and grandmother tried to force him to pray to [[God]]. Wright later threatened to move out of his grandmother's home when she would not allow him to work on [[Saturday]]s. His aunt's and grandparents' overbearing attempts to control caused him to permanently hate [[Christians|Christian]]s and their works.<ref name=abuse/>

At the age of 15, while in eighth grade, Wright published his first story, \"The Voodoo of Hell's Half-Acre,\" in the local Black newspaper ''Southern Register.'' No copies survive.<ref name=\"Rayson2\"/> In Chapter 7 of ''Black Boy'', he described the story as about a villain who sought a widow's home.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher= Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 182–186 |url= }}</ref>

After excelling in grade school and junior high, in 1923, Wright earned the position of class [[valedictorian]] of Smith Robertson Junior High School from which he graduated in May 1925.<ref name=\"Rayson2\"/><ref name=life/> He was assigned to write a paper to be delivered at graduation in a public auditorium. Later, he was called to the principal's office, where the principal gave him a prepared speech to present in place of his own. Richard challenged the principal, saying \"the people are coming to hear the students, and I won't make a speech that you've written.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 193–197 |url= }}</ref> The principal threatened him, suggesting that Richard might not be allowed to graduate if he persisted, despite his having passed all the examinations. He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an [[Uncle Tom]], Richard refused to deliver the principal's address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. The principal put pressure on one of Richard's uncles to speak to the boy and get him to change his mind, but Richard continued to be adamant about presenting his own speech, and refused to let his uncle edit it. Despite pressure even from his classmates, Richard delivered his speech as he had planned.

In September that year, Wright registered for mathematics, English, and history courses at the new [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]], constructed for black students in Jackson—the state's schools were segregated under its Jim Crow laws—but he had to stop attending classes after a few weeks of irregular attendance because he needed to earn money for family expenses.<ref name=\"Rayson3\">Rayson, Ann. \"Richard Wright's Life.\" [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/r_wright/wright_life.htm Modern American Poetry]. Nelson, Cary and Brinkman, Bartholomew, eds. Department of English.</ref>

The next year, in November of 1925 at the age of 17, Wright moved on his own to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He planned to have his mother come to live with him when he could support her, and in 1926, his mother and younger brother did rejoin him. Shortly thereafter, Richard resolved to leave the [[Jim Crow economy|Jim Crow South]] and go to Chicago.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 276–278|url= }}</ref> His family joined the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when tens of thousands of blacks left the South to seek opportunities in the more economically prosperous northern and mid-western industrial cities.

Wright's childhood in Mississippi, as well as in Memphis, Tennessee, and Elaine, Arkansas, shaped his lasting impressions of American racism.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black Boy |last=Wright |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |location=New York |isbn=0-06-081250-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig/page/455 455]–459 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig |url-access=registration }}</ref>

=== Coming of age in Chicago ===

Wright and his family moved to Chicago in 1927. After securing employment as a United States postal clerk, during his time off, he read other writers and studied their styles. When he was fired from the post office during the [[Great Depression]], Wright was forced to go [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|on relief]] in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the [[John Reed Club]]. As the club was dominated by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], Wright established a relationship with several party members. Especially interested in the literary contacts made at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote numerous proletarian poems (\"We of the Red Leaves of Red Books\", for example), for ''[[The New Masses]]'' and other [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |first= Richard |authorlink= |editor= Crossman, Richard |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |publisher= [[Bantam Books]] |location= New York |language= |pages= 109–10 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>

By 1935, Wright had completed the manuscript of his first novel, ''Cesspool'', which was published posthumously as ''Lawd Today'' (1963). In January 1936 his story \"Big Boy Leaves Home\" was accepted for publication in ''New Caravan.'' In February of that year, he began working with the [[National Negro Congress]]. In April he chaired the [[South Side Writers Group]], whose members included [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Margaret Walker]]. Wright submitted some of his critical essays and poetry to the group for criticism and read aloud some of his short stories. Through the club, he edited ''Left Front,'' a magazine that the Communist Party shut down in 1937, despite Wright's repeated protests.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 121 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Throughout this period, Wright continued to contribute to ''The New Masses'' magazine.

Pleased by his positive relations with white Communists in Chicago, Wright was later humiliated in New York City by some white party members who rescinded an offer to find housing for him when they learned his race.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 123–26 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>  Some black Communists denounced Wright as a \"[[bourgeois]] intellectual.\"  Wright was essentially [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]]. He had been forced to end his public education after completing junior high school to support his mother and brother.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965|pages= 13–16 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= }}</ref>

Wright insisted that young communist writers be given space to cultivate their talents.  He had developed a working relationship with a [[black nationalist]] communist, which, along with his dissatisfaction with the attitudes of and restrictions imposed by those in the party, led to a public falling out with the party and a number of its leading members. Wright later described this episode through his fictional character Buddy Nealson, [[The Communist Party and African-Americans|an African-American communist]] in his essay \"I tried to be a Communist\", published in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in 1944. This text was an excerpt of his autobiography scheduled to be published as ''American Hunger'', but removed from the actual publication of ''[[Black Boy]]'' upon request by the [[Book of the Month Club]].<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman|title= The God That Failed |year= 1960 |pages= 126–34 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}. It remained an essay until the publication of ''American Hunger'' in 1977 and the complete ''Black Boy (American Hunger)'' in 1991. James Zeigler: ''Red Scare Racism and Cold War Black Radicalism''. Jackson: Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2015, pp. 72–73.</ref> Indeed, his relations with the party turned violent; Wright was threatened at knife point by [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveler]] co-workers, denounced as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] in the street by strikers, and physically assaulted by former comrades when he tried to join them during the 1936 [[May Day]] march.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= |title=The God That Failed |year=1965 |pages=143–45 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>

==Career==

In 1937, Wright moved to New York, where he forged new ties with some Communist Party members. He worked on the [[Federal Writers' Project]] guidebook to the city, ''New York Panorama'' (1938), and wrote the book's essay on [[Harlem]]. Wright became the Harlem editor of the ''[[Daily Worker]],'' a Communist newspaper. Through the summer and fall he wrote more than 200 articles for the ''Daily Worker'' and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine ''New Challenge.'' The year was also a landmark for Wright because he met and developed a friendship with writer [[Ralph Ellison]] that would last for years. He was awarded the ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine first prize of $500 for his short story \"Fire and Cloud\".<ref name=\"story\" />

After receiving the ''Story'' prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of ''Lawd Today'' and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher [[Harper & Row|Harper]] all of Wright's prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.

Wright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled ''[[Uncle Tom's Children]]'' (1938). He based some stories on [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] in the [[Deep South]]. The publication and favorable reception of ''Uncle Tom's Children'' improved Wright's status with the Communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of ''New Masses.'' [[Granville Hicks]], a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel ''[[Native Son]],'' which he published in 1940.

Based on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete ''Native Son.'' During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent [[Communists]] whom Wright had known in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T6-lhNKL3ncC&pg=PT147&dq=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton#v=onepage&q=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton&f=false|title=Literary Brooklyn: The Writers of Brooklyn and the Story of American City Life|first=Evan|last=Hughes|date=August 16, 2011|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=September 30, 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781429973069}}</ref> They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in [[Brooklyn]] in the [[Fort Greene Historic District|Fort Greene]] neighborhood.<ref>Oleksinski, Johnny. Find out if New York’s greatest writers lived next door.

After publication, ''Native Son'' was selected by the [[Book of the Month Club]] as its first book by an African-American author. It was a daring choice. The lead character, Bigger Thomas, was a person bound by the limitations that society placed on African Americans. He gained his own [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts.

Wright was criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of ''Native Son,'' people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of ''Native Son'' was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by [[Edwin Rosskam]]. While in Chicago he visited the ''American Negro Exhibition'' with [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Claude McKay]].
[[File:Canada-Lee-Native-Son-1941.jpg|thumb|[[Canada Lee]] as Bigger Thomas in the [[Orson Welles]] production of ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' (1941)]]
He traveled to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], to collaborate with playwright [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''Native Son.'' In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious [[Spingarn Medal]] of the [[NAACP]] for noteworthy achievement. His play ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' opened on Broadway in March 1941, with [[Orson Welles]] as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the [[Farm Security Administration]]. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, ''Twelve Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States,'' was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.

Wright's memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945) described his early life from [[Roxie, Mississippi|Roxie]] up until his move to Chicago at age 19. It included his clashes with [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. ''American Hunger'', which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of ''Black Boy.'' The [[Library of America]] edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.

''American Hunger'' detailed Wright's participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implied he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In the book's restored form, Wright used the [[diptych]] structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned \"bourgeois\" books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] in the [[Soviet Union]], but he continued to believe in far-left democratic solutions to political problems.

===France===
[[File:Plaque Richard Wright, 14 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, Paris 6.jpg|350px|thumbnail|Plaque commemorating Wright's residence in Paris, at 14, rue Monsieur le Prince.]]

Following a stay of a few months in [[Québec, Canada]], including a lengthy stay in the village of Sainte-Pétronille on the [[Île d'Orléans]],<ref>Jean-Christophe Cloutier, Introduction to ''Jack Kerouac, La vie est d'hommage'' (Boréal, 2016), pp. 31–32.</ref> Wright moved to Paris in 1946. He became a permanent American [[expatriate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/wright/wright_bio.html|title=Richard Wright Biography|author=|date=|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref>

In Paris, he became friends with French writers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]], even though, as Michel Fabre argues, Wright's existentialist leanings were more influenced by [[Soren Kierkegaard]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and especially [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref>Michel Fabre, ''The Unfinished Quest of Richard Wright'' (1993), pp. 374</ref> In following Fabre's argument, with respect to Wright's existentialist proclivities during the period of 1946 to 1951, Hue Woodson suggests that Wright's exposure to Husserl and Heidegger \"directly came as an intended consequence of the inadequacies of Sartre's synthesis of [[existentialism]] and [[Marxism]] for Wright.\"<ref>Hue Woodson, \"Heidegger and ''The Outsider,'' ''Savage Holiday,'' and ''The Long Dream''\" in ''Critical Insights: Richard Wright,'' edited by Kimberly Drake (2019), p. 62</ref>  His [[Existentialist]] phase was expressed in his second novel, ''[[The Outsider (Richard Wright)|The Outsider]]'' (1953), which described an African-American character's involvement with the Communist Party in New York. He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers [[Chester Himes]] and [[James Baldwin]]. His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel\" (collected in ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]''), in which he criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published ''Savage Holiday.''

After becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology ''[[The God That Failed]];'' his essay had been published in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of ''Black Boy.'' He was invited to join the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the [[CIA]]. Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the [[FBI]] had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as the teenager Bigger Thomas (Wright was 42) in an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] film version of ''[[Native Son (1951 film)|Native Son]].''

In mid-1953, Wright traveled to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], where [[Kwame Nkrumah]] was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as [[Ghana]]. Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in [[Accra]] on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the [[U.S. Department of State|US State Department]]. The officer's report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah adviser [[George Padmore]] about Nkrumah's plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a [[Trinidad]]ian living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale's Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright's book on his African journey, ''[[Black Power (Richard Wright book)|Black Power]],'' was published in 1954; its London publisher was [[Dennis Dobson]], who also published Padmore's work.<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause'' (2009), pp. 125–28.</ref>

Whatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer [[Addison Gayle]], a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the [[Smith Act]].<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement'' (2001), p. 82.</ref>

Historian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the [[civil rights movement]] during the 1950s in the United States. She found that Wright was under what his friend Chester Himes called \"extraordinary pressure\" to avoid writing about the US.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> As ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine delayed publishing his essay, \"I Choose Exile,\" Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical. He believed that \"a white periodical would be less vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.\"<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> He thought the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' was interested, but in the end, the piece went unpublished.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\">Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds'', pp. 80–81.</ref><ref>[http://thisissoulone.tumblr.com/post/21392983785/richard-wright-i-choose-exile-i-am-a-native The essay \"I Choose Exile\" Online published accessed August 5,2018]</ref>

In 1955, Wright visited [[Indonesia]] for the [[Bandung Conference]]. He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in ''[[The Color Curtain|The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference]].'' Wright was enthusiastic about the possibilities posed by this meeting of newly independent, former colonial nations. He gave at least two lectures to Indonesian cultural groups, including [[PEN Club]] Indonesia, and he interviewed Indonesian artists and intellectuals in preparation to write ''The Color Curtain.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Brian|title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|pages=153–153, 161}}</ref> Several Indonesian artists and intellectuals whom  Wright met, later commented on how he had depicted Indonesian cultural conditions in his [[travel writing]].<!-- saying what? he got it or did not? --><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vuyk|first=Beb|title=A Weekend with Richard Wright|journal=PMLA|date=May 2011|volume=126|issue=3|pages=810|doi=10.1632/pmla.2011.126.3.798}}</ref>

Other works by Richard Wright included ''White Man, Listen!'' (1957); a novel ''The Long Dream'' (1958), which was adapted as a play and produced in New York in 1960 by [[Ketti Frings]]. It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0904.html \"Richard Wright, Writer, 52, Dies\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 30, 1960.</ref> A collection of [[short story|short stories]], ''Eight Men,'' was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright's  death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.

His agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright's 400-page ''Island of Hallucinations'' manuscript in February 1959. Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.

On June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of ''White Man, Listen!,'' Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of [[amoebic dysentery]], probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959 his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright's illness and \"four hassles in twelve days\" with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.

On February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of ''The Long Dream'' received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get ''The Long Dream'' published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of ''Island of Hallucinations,'' for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from [[Doubleday and Sons]].

In June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia's move from London to Paris to attend the [[Sorbonne]], Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.

In spite of his financial straits, Wright refused to compromise his principles. He declined to participate in a series of programs for Canadian radio because he suspected American control. For the same reason, he rejected an invitation from the Congress for Cultural Freedom to go to India to speak at a conference in memory of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Still interested in literature, Wright helped [[Kyle Onstott]] get his novel ''[[Mandingo (novel)|Mandingo]]'' (1957) published in France.

Wright's last display of explosive energy occurred on November 8, 1960, in his polemical lecture, \"The Situation of the Black Artist and Intellectual in the United States,\" delivered to students and members of the [[American Church in Paris]]. He argued that American society reduced the most militant members of the black community to slaves whenever they wanted to question the racial status quo. He offered as proof the subversive attacks of the Communists against ''Native Son'' and the quarrels which [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and other authors sought with him. On November 26, 1960, Wright talked enthusiastically with Langston Hughes about his work ''Daddy Goodness'' and gave him the manuscript.

He died in Paris on November 28, 1960, of a [[heart attack]] at the age of 52. He was interred in [[Le Père Lachaise Cemetery]]. Wright's daughter Julia has claimed that her father was murdered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rwright.htm |title=Richard Wright |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518164622/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rwright.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

A number of Wright's works have been published posthumously. In addition, some of Wright's more shocking passages dealing with race, sex, and politics were cut or omitted before original publication of works during his lifetime. In 1991, unexpurgated versions of ''Native Son,'' ''Black Boy,'' and his other works were published. In addition, in 1994, his novella ''Rite of Passage'' was published for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/children-s-books-black-history-bookshelf.html |title=Children's Books/Black History; Bookshelf |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 13, 1994}}</ref>

In the last years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form [[Haiku in English|haiku]] and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was published (''Haiku: This Other World'') with 817 of his own favorite haikus. Many of these haikus have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.

A collection of Wright's travel writings was published by [[Mississippi University Press]] in 2001. At his death, Wright left an unfinished book, ''A Father's Law,''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/Powers-t.html?_r=0 |title=Ambiguities |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 24, 2008}}</ref> dealing with a black policeman and the son he suspects of murder. His daughter Julia Wright published ''A Father's Law'' in January 2008. An omnibus edition containing Wright's political works was published under the title ''Three Books from Exile: Black Power; The Color Curtain; and White Man, Listen!''

During the 1950s Wright grew more internationalist in outlook. While he accomplished much as an important public literary and political figure with a worldwide reputation, his creative work did decline.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/s_z/r_wright/r_wright.htm |title= Richard Wright (1908–1960) |accessdate=2008-10-07 |last= Mullen |first= Bill |date= |work= Modern American Poetry |publisher= [[University of Illinois]] }}</ref>

While interest in ''Black Boy'' ebbed during the 1950s, this has remained one of his best selling books. Since the late 20th century, critics have had a resurgence of interest in it. ''Black Boy'' remains a vital work of historical, sociological, and literary significance whose seminal portrayal of one black man's search for self-actualization in a racist society strongly influenced the works of African-American writers who followed, such as [[James Baldwin]] and [[Ralph Ellison]].

It is generally agreed that the influence of Wright's ''Native Son'' is not a matter of literary style or technique.{{sfn|Corkery|2007|pp=17–28}} Rather, in this book affected ideas and attitudes, and ''Native Son'' has been a force in the social and intellectual history of the United States in the last half of the 20th century. \"Wright was one of the people who made me conscious of the need to struggle,\" said writer [[Amiri Baraka]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.itvs.org/RichardWright/more_info.html |title= Richard Wright – Black Boy |accessdate=2008-10-07 |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Independent Television Service]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080715231354/http://www.itvs.org/RichardWright/more_info.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-15}}</ref>

During the 1970s and 1980s, scholars published critical essays about Wright in prestigious journals. Richard Wright conferences were held on university campuses from Mississippi to New Jersey. A new film version of ''Native Son,'' with a screenplay by [[Richard Wesley]], was released in December 1986. Certain Wright novels became required reading in a number of American high schools, universities and colleges.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/10748/Richard_Wright/index.aspx|title= Richard Wright |accessdate=2008-10-07 |website= |publisher= [[Harper Collins]] |date= }}</ref>

\"Recent critics have called for a reassessment of Wright's later work in view of his philosophical project. Notably, [[Paul Gilroy]] has argued that 'the depth of his philosophical interests has been either overlooked or misconceived by the almost exclusively literary inquiries that have dominated analysis of his writing.'\"<ref>Sarah Relyea, ''Outsider Citizens'' (New York: Routledge, 2006): 62. Paul Gilroy, ''The Black Atlantic'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993), 147.</ref> \"His most significant contribution, however, was his desire to accurately portray blacks to white readers, thereby destroying the white myth of the patient, humorous, subservient black man.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/english/ms-writers/dir/wright_richard/ |title= Richard Wright |accessdate=2008-10-07 |last= Duffus |first= Matthew |date= 1999-01-26|work= The Mississippi Writers Page |publisher= [[University of Mississippi]] }}</ref>

'''''Krrish ''''' ({{IPA-hi|ˈkrɪʃ}}) is a 2006 Indian [[Hindi]]-language [[superhero film]] directed, produced, and written by [[Rakesh Roshan]], and starring [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Priyanka Chopra]], [[Rekha]] and [[Naseeruddin Shah]]. It is the second installment in the [[Krrish (franchise)|''Krrish'' franchise]], being the continuation to ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'', and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of \"Krrish\" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Arya, who has a connection to Krishna's father, Rohit, the protagonist of the previous film.

''Krrish '' was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert [[Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The music was composed by [[Rajesh Roshan]], with the background score by [[Salim-Sulaiman]]. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India.

The film was released worldwide on 23 June 2006 at a budget of {{INR}}400 million<ref name=\"Budget\"/> and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. ''Krrish'' received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. A [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Krrish'' grossed a worldwide total of {{INR}}1.26 billion,<ref name=\"Kr\"/> becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2006|third highest earning Indian film of 2006]].

''Krrish'' was nominated for eight [[Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Best Film Award|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Best Director Award|Best Director]], [[Filmfare Best Actor Award|Best Actor]] for Roshan, and [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] for Rekha, winning three, including [[Filmfare Best Special Effects Award|Best Special Effects]]. At the [[8th IIFA Awards|2007 IIFA Awards]], the film received nine nominations and won three, with one being [[IIFA Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Roshan. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Special Effects]]. The third film in the series, ''[[Krrish 3]]'' was released in 2013.

== Plot ==
{{Hatnote|The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see [[Koi... Mil Gaya#Plot|Koi... Mil Gaya]].}}
Five-year-old Krishna Mehra, son of the late scientist Rohit Mehra, undergoes an [[intelligence quotient]] test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother Sonia takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends Priya and Honey when Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.

After returning home to [[Singapore]], Priya and Honey are fired by their boss for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. To keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Sonia objects to this, saying that people will want to exploit his abilities. She then explains the events of [[Koi... Mil Gaya|the previous film]], and that Rohit was hired by scientist Siddhant Arya to design a computer that could see the future to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. Rohit later discovered that the purpose of the computer was not for good, so he destroyed it. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of trauma shortly thereafter. Krishna promises Sonia that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself; Honey and Priya are fired again.

Krishna meets circus performer Kristian Li, who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to his circus, where a fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze. To save the children without revealing his abilities, Krishna dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside-out, creating the persona of \"Krrish\". Later, when Kristian sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna is Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery.

Meanwhile, Priya discovers that Krishna is Krrish upon seeing the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected.

After being confronted by Krishna at his apartment they talked what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha, who has been searching for Krishna for years. He tells them that Rohit is still alive; after completing the computer, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding Rohit at gunpoint. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the computer for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy it, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant.

In the present, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.

When Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However, Vikram is shot dead by Siddhant. Krrish eventually wounds Siddhant fatally. Before Siddhant dies, Krrish reveals himself as Krishna. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and his father back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit then uses his father's special computer to contact his alien friend Jadoo, whose spaceship is later seen from a distance.

====India====
''Krrish'' received mixed reviews from critics in India.<ref name=mixed>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/krrish1/20060627.htm |title=Krrish might outfly Fanaa&nbsp;— Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Rediff.com |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=31 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200821/http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/krrish1/20060627.htm |archivedate= 2 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Taran Adarsh]] of [[Bollywood Hungama]] believed that the film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed ''Krrish'' to be \"a terrifically exciting and compelling experience\", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars.<ref name=bhr>{{cite web|authorlink=Taran Adarash |first=Taran |last=Adarash |title=Krrish: Movie Review |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/54355 |publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |date=22 June 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130054935/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/54355 |archivedate=30 January 2013 }}</ref> Nikhat Kazmi noted in ''[[The Times of India]]'' that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor.<ref name=toireview>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-06-24/news-interviews/27810161_1_jadoo-priyanka-chopra-darshan |title=Review: Krrish&nbsp;— Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=27 November 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, Raja Sen said that ''Krrish'' was infinitely better than ''KMG'', though ultimately it was all about Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for [[Rediff.com|Rediff]], both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said that it was a good film for children. Sen summarised \"So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned.

He summarised, \"''Krrish'' neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes.

'''''Krrish ''''' ({{IPA-hi|ˈkrɪʃ}}) is a 2006 Indian [[Hindi]]-language [[superhero film]] directed, produced, and written by [[Rakesh Roshan]], and starring [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Priyanka Chopra]], [[Rekha]] and [[Naseeruddin Shah]]. It is the second installment in the [[Krrish (franchise)|''Krrish'' franchise]], being the continuation to ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'', and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of \"Krrish\" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Arya, who has a connection to Krishna's father, Rohit, the protagonist of the previous film.

''Krrish '' was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert [[Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The music was composed by [[Rajesh Roshan]], with the background score by [[Salim-Sulaiman]]. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India.

The film was released worldwide on 23 June 2006 at a budget of {{INR}}400 million<ref name=\"Budget\"/> and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. ''Krrish'' received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. A [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Krrish'' grossed a worldwide total of {{INR}}1.26 billion,<ref name=\"Kr\"/> becoming the [[List of Bollywood films of 2006|third highest earning Indian film of 2006]].

''Krrish'' was nominated for eight [[Filmfare Awards]], including [[Filmfare Best Film Award|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Best Director Award|Best Director]], [[Filmfare Best Actor Award|Best Actor]] for Roshan, and [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award|Best Supporting Actress]] for Rekha, winning three, including [[Filmfare Best Special Effects Award|Best Special Effects]]. At the [[8th IIFA Awards|2007 IIFA Awards]], the film received nine nominations and won three, with one being [[IIFA Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Roshan. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Special Effects]]. The third film in the series, ''[[Krrish 3]]'' was released in 2013.

== Plot ==
{{Hatnote|The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see [[Koi... Mil Gaya#Plot|Koi... Mil Gaya]].}}
Five-year-old Krishna Mehra, son of the late scientist Rohit Mehra, undergoes an [[intelligence quotient]] test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother Sonia takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends Priya and Honey when Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.

After returning home to [[Singapore]], Priya and Honey are fired by their boss for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. To keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Sonia objects to this, saying that people will want to exploit his abilities. She then explains the events of [[Koi... Mil Gaya|the previous film]], and that Rohit was hired by scientist Siddhant Arya to design a computer that could see the future to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. Rohit later discovered that the purpose of the computer was not for good, so he destroyed it. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of trauma shortly thereafter. Krishna promises Sonia that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself; Honey and Priya are fired again.

Krishna meets circus performer Kristian Li, who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to his circus, where a fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze. To save the children without revealing his abilities, Krishna dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside-out, creating the persona of \"Krrish\". Later, when Kristian sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna is Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery.

Meanwhile, Priya discovers that Krishna is Krrish upon seeing the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected.

After being confronted by Krishna at his apartment they talked what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha, who has been searching for Krishna for years. He tells them that Rohit is still alive; after completing the computer, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding Rohit at gunpoint. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the computer for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy it, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant.

In the present, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.

When Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However, Vikram is shot dead by Siddhant. Krrish eventually wounds Siddhant fatally. Before Siddhant dies, Krrish reveals himself as Krishna. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and his father back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit then uses his father's special computer to contact his alien friend Jadoo, whose spaceship is later seen from a distance.

== History ==

Located in the westernmost portion of India, Gujarat includes the region of [[Kutch]], [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], and the territories between the rivers [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Daman Ganga River|Damanganga]]. [[Islam]] came early to Gujarat, with immigrant communities of [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders.  Most came as traders as they did before Islam and built a masjid during the times of Muhammad and other parts of the western seacoast of India as early as the 8th century C.E, spreading Islam soon as the religion gained a foothold in the Arabian peninsula.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gokhale|title=Surat In The Seventeenth Century|publisher=Popular Prakashan|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=frbYo91TuV4C&pg=PA28&dq=surat,+gujarat,+Islam,+muslim,+arab#v=onepage&q=surat%2C%20gujarat%2C%20Islam%2C%20muslim%2C%20arab&f=false|accessdate=23 February 2015|quote=Islam was introduced into Gujarat in the 7th century C.E.

After the fall of Alamut to the Mongols in 1256, more Nizari missionaries came to Sind and Gujarat, Ucch in particular becoming an important centre.}}</ref> Many of these early merchants were [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]], both [[Mustaali]] and [[Nizari]]. They laid the foundation of the [[Mustaali|Bohra]] and [[Khoja]] communities. In the early era however Gujarat was ruled by the [[Valabhi]] dynasty. In the thirteenth century, the last [[Hindu]] ruler Karna, was defeated by [[Alauddin Khalji]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Dehli]]. This episode ushered a period of five centuries of Muslim Turkic and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule, leading to a conversion of a number of Hindu Gujarati people to [[Islam]], and the creation of new communities such as the [[Molesalam Rajput|Molesalam]] and [[Miyana (community)|Miyana]] communities.

In the sixteenth century, the [[Memon people|Memon]] community immigrated from [[Sindh]] and settled in Kutch and [[Kathiawar]]. While in [[Bharuch]] and [[Surat]], a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] occurred among the Bohras, and a new community of [[Sunni Bohra]]s was created.

Social organization at the Jamat Bandi level varies from community to community. In some communities, the Jamat simply runs a mosque and attached rest house, and a [[madrasah]].

Despite the medieval conquest of Gujarat by [[Alauddin Khalji]] and its annexation to the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the 13th century, peaceful Islamic settlements appear to have continued under Hindu rule. Bi-lingual Indian inscriptions from [[Somnath]] in Sanskrit and Arabic, make reference to the Arab and Iranian shipowners who constructed mosques in Gujarat from the grants given to Muslims by the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] rajput ruler, Arjunadeva.

== History ==

Located in the westernmost portion of India, Gujarat includes the region of [[Kutch]], [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], and the territories between the rivers [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Daman Ganga River|Damanganga]]. [[Islam]] came early to Gujarat, with immigrant communities of [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders.  Most came as traders as they did before Islam and built a masjid during the times of Muhammad and other parts of the western seacoast of India as early as the 8th century C.E, spreading Islam soon as the religion gained a foothold in the Arabian peninsula.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gokhale|title=Surat In The Seventeenth Century|publisher=Popular Prakashan|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=frbYo91TuV4C&pg=PA28&dq=surat,+gujarat,+Islam,+muslim,+arab#v=onepage&q=surat%2C%20gujarat%2C%20Islam%2C%20muslim%2C%20arab&f=false|accessdate=23 February 2015|quote=Islam was introduced into Gujarat in the 7th century C.E.

After the fall of Alamut to the Mongols in 1256, more Nizari missionaries came to Sind and Gujarat, Ucch in particular becoming an important centre.}}</ref> Many of these early merchants were [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]], both [[Mustaali]] and [[Nizari]]. They laid the foundation of the [[Mustaali|Bohra]] and [[Khoja]] communities. In the early era however Gujarat was ruled by the [[Valabhi]] dynasty. In the thirteenth century, the last [[Hindu]] ruler Karna, was defeated by [[Alauddin Khalji]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Dehli]]. This episode ushered a period of five centuries of Muslim Turkic and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule, leading to a conversion of a number of Hindu Gujarati people to [[Islam]], and the creation of new communities such as the [[Molesalam Rajput|Molesalam]] and [[Miyana (community)|Miyana]] communities.

In the sixteenth century, the [[Memon people|Memon]] community immigrated from [[Sindh]] and settled in Kutch and [[Kathiawar]]. While in [[Bharuch]] and [[Surat]], a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] occurred among the Bohras, and a new community of [[Sunni Bohra]]s was created.

It is designed to regulate the affairs of the community and apply sanctions against infractions of the communal code. Almost all the main Gujarat communities, such as the [[Ismailism|Ismāʿīlī]],    [[Khoja]], [[Dawoodi Bohra]], [[Chhipa]], and [[Sunni Bohra]] have [[caste]] associations, known as jamats. Social organization at the Jamat Bandi level varies from community to community. In some communities, the Jamat simply runs a mosque and attached rest house, and a [[madrasah]]. Some larger communities, such as the [[Khoja]] and [[Memon people|Memon]] have developed elaborate and highly formalized systems with written and registered constitutions. Their organizations own large properties, undertake housing projects and schools, dispensaries and weekly newspapers.

Despite the medieval conquest of Gujarat by [[Alauddin Khalji]] and its annexation to the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the 13th century, peaceful Islamic settlements appear to have continued under Hindu rule. Bi-lingual Indian inscriptions from [[Somnath]] in Sanskrit and Arabic, make reference to the Arab and Iranian shipowners who constructed mosques in Gujarat from the grants given to Muslims by the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] rajput ruler, Arjunadeva.

The '''2019 WWE Draft''' was the fourteenth [[WWE Draft]] produced by the [[American professional wrestling]] promotion [[WWE]] between their [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. Returning to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and a traditional draft format, it was the second draft of 2019, following April's [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]]. The draft began on the October 11 episode of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' (in [[Paradise, Nevada]]) and concluded on the October 14 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' (in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]), with ''SmackDown'' airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] and ''Raw'' on the [[USA Network]]. It was the first draft in which the brand's television networks were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions. 

2019 was the first year in which the WWE held two drafts during the same calendar year. This was because of the issues of the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]] introduced with April's Superstar Shake-up and even more so because of ''SmackDown''{{'}}s move to FOX—''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' were both previously on the USA Network. Over 70 wrestlers (both singles competitors and tag teams) from the Raw, SmackDown, [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]] rosters were eligible to be drafted to either Raw or SmackDown, including all Raw and SmackDown champions. Most draft picks were announced on the live broadcasts of ''SmackDown'' and ''Raw'', while supplemental picks were announced afterwards via WWE's website. In storyline, wrestlers who were not drafted to either brand became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing. The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.

===Background===
In April 2019, [[WWE]] held the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]], a [[WWE draft|draft]] between WWE's [[WWE brand extension|brands]] with a nontraditional format in which drafting decisions were made behind the scenes rather than on-screen.<ref name=\"Raw04152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/15/4-15-powells-wwe-raw-tv-review-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-one/|title=4/15 Powell's WWE Raw TV Review: The 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night One|date=April 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown04162019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/16/4-16-wwe-smackdown-live-results-barnetts-review-of-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-two-with-vince-mcmahon-introducing-the-brands-biggest-acquisition-paige-introduces-her-new-tag-team/|title=4/16 WWE Smackdown Live Results: Barnett's review of the 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night Two with Vince McMahon introducing the brand's biggest acquisition, Paige introduces her new tag team|date=April 16, 2019|last=Barnett|first=Jake |work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after the Shake-up, WWE Chairman and CEO [[Vince McMahon]] introduced the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]], in which up to four wrestlers would be allowed to appear on the opposing brand's show by invitation for one night only with unsanctioned appearances penalized.<ref name=\"Raw05062019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/05/06/5-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-review-of-roman-reigns-returning-to-raw-the-build-to-money-in-the-bank-continues/|title=5/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell's review of Roman Reigns returning to Raw, the build to Money in the Bank continues|date=May 6, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/raw-smackdown-live-wild-card-rule-explained|title=Mr. McMahon's new \"Wild Card Rule\" explained|date=May 6, 2019|last=Benigno|first=Anthony|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref> Following this, however, the Wild Card Rule's stipulations were not enforced, with numerous wrestlers freely appearing on both shows weekly without any penalties, blurring the lines between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands. With ''[[SmackDown]]''{{'}}s move to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] in October and ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' remaining on the [[USA Network]] (part of [[Comcast]]'s [[NBCUniversal]]), WWE decided to hold a second draft for 2019 to definitively split the two brands.

===2019 draft rules===
The rules of the draft were posted on WWE's website on October 10.<ref name=\"2019draftrules\"/> The list of eligible wrestlers was posted the same day. Over 70 wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and 205 Live rosters, as well as tag teams, were eligible to be drafted to either Raw or SmackDown, including all Raw and SmackDown champions (although the [[WWE 24/7 Champion]] and [[WWE Women's Tag Team Champions]] were eligible to be drafted, they still defend their respective titles across the brands).<ref name=\"2019drafteligiblewrestlers\"/>

The rules of the draft were the following:
*Up to 30 picks were allotted on the October 11 ''SmackDown'', while up to 41 picks were allotted on the October 14 ''Raw''.
*For every two draft picks for SmackDown, Raw received three picks (due to ''SmackDown'' being a two-hour show, while ''Raw'' is three hours).
*Tag teams counted as one pick unless FOX or USA specifically only wanted a single member from the team as their pick.
*Any undrafted wrestlers became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing.

==Drafting pool==
The drafting pool was divided between the broadcasts of both shows, with up to 30 picks allotted on ''SmackDown'' and 41 on ''Raw''. Any remaining picks from the respective draft pools were announced on WWE's website. Undrafted wrestlers (those not selected on the shows or announced via WWE.com) immediately became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing.<ref name=\"2019drafteligiblewrestlers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/article/preliminary-wwe-draft-pools|title=Preliminary WWE Draft Pools announced|date=October 10, 2019|author=[[WWE]].com Staff|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

=== ''SmackDown'' (October 11) ===

==Aftermath==
Two weeks after the draft, WWE held its pay-per-view event [[Crown Jewel (2019)|Crown Jewel]]. At the event, although the two had been drafted to separate brands, Raw draftee Seth Rollins defended the Universal Championship against SmackDown draftee [[\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] in a [[falls count anywhere match]] that could not be stopped for any reason; this was a rematch from [[Hell in a Cell (2019)|Hell in a Cell]], which was a [[Hell in a Cell match]] that ended by referee stoppage. The Fiend defeated Rollins to win the Universal Championship, and the title was subsequently transferred to the SmackDown brand, resulting in SmackDown having both the Universal and [[WWE Championship]]s.<ref name=\"CrownJewel2019\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=WWE Crown Jewel results: Powell's live review of Brock Lesnar vs. Cain Velasquez for the WWE Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Bray Wyatt in a Falls Count Anywhere match for the WWE Universal Championship, Braun Strowman vs. Tyson Fury, Lacey Evans vs. Natalya|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/10/31/wwe-crown-jewel-results-powells-live-review-of-brock-lesnar-vs-cain-velasquez-for-the-wwe-championship-seth-rollins-vs-bray-wyatt-in-a-falls-count-anywhere-match-for-the-wwe-universal-championsh/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref> This was quickly fixed, however.

Although the Wild Card Rule had ended with the 2019 draft, the theme of the next big pay-per-view, Survivor Series, has been brand supremacy since 2016, which would see the brands invading each others shows in the build up to the event. Just prior to the draft, WWE's [[Farm team|developmental territory]] NXT was promoted to being WWE's third major brand and it was subsequently added to the 2019 Survivor Series brand competition. This in turn resulted in wrestlers from the three brands invading each others shows to build matches for the event. In a media call for [[NXT TakeOver: WarGames (2019)|NXT TakeOver: WarGames]], WWE COO and NXT head Triple H said that viewers would see definitive brand division following Survivor Series.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40NPOBYuruA|title=Triple H Media Call For NXT Takeover WarGames 2019|date=November 20, 2019|author=Fightful Pro Wrestling|publisher=[[YouTube]]|time=4:57|accessdate=November 22, 2019}}</ref>

The '''2019 WWE Draft''' was the fourteenth [[WWE Draft]] produced by the [[American professional wrestling]] promotion [[WWE]] between their [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. Returning to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and a traditional draft format, it was the second draft of 2019, following April's [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]]. The draft began on the October 11 episode of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' (in [[Paradise, Nevada]]) and concluded on the October 14 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' (in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]), with ''SmackDown'' airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] and ''Raw'' on the [[USA Network]]. It was the first draft in which the brand's television networks were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions. 

2019 was the first year in which the WWE held two drafts during the same calendar year. This was because of the issues of the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]] introduced with April's Superstar Shake-up and even more so because of ''SmackDown''{{'}}s move to FOX—''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' were both previously on the USA Network. Over 70 wrestlers (both singles competitors and tag teams) from the Raw, SmackDown, [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]] rosters were eligible to be drafted to either Raw or SmackDown, including all Raw and SmackDown champions. Most draft picks were announced on the live broadcasts of ''SmackDown'' and ''Raw'', while supplemental picks were announced afterwards via WWE's website. In storyline, wrestlers who were not drafted to either brand became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing. The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.

===Background===
In April 2019, [[WWE]] held the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]], a [[WWE draft|draft]] between WWE's [[WWE brand extension|brands]] with a nontraditional format in which drafting decisions were made behind the scenes rather than on-screen.<ref name=\"Raw04152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/15/4-15-powells-wwe-raw-tv-review-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-one/|title=4/15 Powell's WWE Raw TV Review: The 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night One|date=April 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown04162019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/16/4-16-wwe-smackdown-live-results-barnetts-review-of-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-two-with-vince-mcmahon-introducing-the-brands-biggest-acquisition-paige-introduces-her-new-tag-team/|title=4/16 WWE Smackdown Live Results: Barnett's review of the 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night Two with Vince McMahon introducing the brand's biggest acquisition, Paige introduces her new tag team|date=April 16, 2019|last=Barnett|first=Jake |work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after the Shake-up, WWE Chairman and CEO [[Vince McMahon]] introduced the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]], in which up to four wrestlers would be allowed to appear on the opposing brand's show by invitation for one night only with unsanctioned appearances penalized.<ref name=\"Raw05062019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/05/06/5-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-review-of-roman-reigns-returning-to-raw-the-build-to-money-in-the-bank-continues/|title=5/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell's review of Roman Reigns returning to Raw, the build to Money in the Bank continues|date=May 6, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/raw-smackdown-live-wild-card-rule-explained|title=Mr. McMahon's new \"Wild Card Rule\" explained|date=May 6, 2019|last=Benigno|first=Anthony|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref> Following this, however, the Wild Card Rule's stipulations were not enforced, with numerous wrestlers freely appearing on both shows weekly without any penalties, blurring the lines between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands. With ''[[SmackDown]]''{{'}}s move to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] in October and ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' remaining on the [[USA Network]] (part of [[Comcast]]'s [[NBCUniversal]]), WWE decided to hold a second draft for 2019 to definitively split the two brands. The draft was announced to occur on the October 11 and 14 episodes of ''SmackDown'' and ''Raw'', respectively. Returning to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and a traditional draft format, personalities from FOX and NBCUniversal were scheduled to appear; the first time that television networks were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-draft-coming-this-october|title=WWE Draft set for SmackDown on Oct. 11 and Raw on Oct. 14|date=September 15, 2019|author=WWE.com Staff|work=[[WWE]]|accessdate=September 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/new-wwe-draft-set-for-two-nights-in-october-2019-over-smackdown-raw-shows/|title=New WWE Draft set for two nights in October 2019 over SmackDown, Raw shows|date=September 15, 2019|last=Crosby|first=Jack|work=[[CBS Sports]]|accessdate=September 15, 2019}}</ref> The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/wwe/2019/09/17/wwe-confirms-wild-card-rule-dead-wwe-draft-raw-smackdown-live/|title=WWE Confirms the Wild Card Rule Will Be Gone After the WWE Draft|date=September 17, 2019|last=Casey|first=Connor|work=ComicBook.com|accessdate=September 23, 2019}}</ref>

The picks were presented by personalities associated with [[Fox Sports]] and NBCUniversal properties, including Fox [[Fox MLB|MLB]] analyst [[Alex Rodriguez]], ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s [[Michael Che]] and [[Colin Jost]] (who performed in the [[André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal]] at [[WrestleMania 35]] earlier in 2019), ''[[Mr. Robot]]''{{'}}s [[Christian Slater]], ''[[Fox NFL]]'' lead commentators [[Joe Buck]] and [[Troy Aikman]], ''[[Mad Money]]'' host [[Jim Cramer]], Fox MLB analysts [[Kevin Burkhardt]] and [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]''{{'}}s [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Howie Long]], [[Michael Strahan]], [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], and [[Tony Gonzalez]], NFL analysts [[Ronde Barber]], [[Charles Davis (defensive back)|Charles Davis]], [[Chris Spielman]], and [[Daryl Johnston]], ''[[Fox NFL Kickoff]]''{{'}}s [[Charissa Thompson]], [[Michael Vick]], and [[Peter Schrager]], ''[[Big Noon Kickoff]]''{{'}}s [[Rob Stone (sportscaster)|Rob Stone]] (former [[WWE 24/7 Champion]]), [[Brady Quinn]], [[Reggie Bush]], [[Matt Leinart]], and [[Urban Meyer]], ''[[Fox College Football]]'' analyst [[Joel Klatt]], [[Dulé Hill]] from USA's ''[[Psych]]'' and ''[[Suits (American TV series)|Suits]]'', [[James Roday]] from ''Psych'', [[Marcus Lemonis]] from [[CNBC]]'s ''[[The Profit (TV series)|The Profit]]'', [[Margaret Josephs]] and [[Melissa Gorga]] from [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[The Real Housewives of New Jersey]]'', [[Rodney Harrison]] and [[Chris Simms]] from NBC's ''[[Football Night in America]]'', and [[Rebecca Lowe]], [[Robbie Mustoe]], and [[Kyle Martino]] from ''Premier League Live''.<ref name=\"2019draftrules\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/article/star-studded-celebrity-lineup-including-alex-rodriguez-michael-che-and-colin-jost|title=Star-studded celebrity lineup, including Alex Rodriguez, Michael Che and Colin Jost, to take part in WWE Draft|date=October 10, 2019|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

===2019 draft rules===
The rules of the draft were posted on WWE's website on October 10.<ref name=\"2019draftrules\"/> The list of eligible wrestlers was posted the same day. Over 70 wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and 205 Live rosters, as well as tag teams, were eligible to be drafted to either Raw or SmackDown, including all Raw and SmackDown champions (although the [[WWE 24/7 Champion]] and [[WWE Women's Tag Team Champions]] were eligible to be drafted, they still defend their respective titles across the brands).<ref name=\"2019drafteligiblewrestlers\"/>

The rules of the draft were the following:
*Up to 30 picks were allotted on the October 11 ''SmackDown'', while up to 41 picks were allotted on the October 14 ''Raw''.
*For every two draft picks for SmackDown, Raw received three picks (due to ''SmackDown'' being a two-hour show, while ''Raw'' is three hours).
*Tag teams counted as one pick unless FOX or USA specifically only wanted a single member from the team as their pick.
*Any undrafted wrestlers became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing.

==Drafting pool==
The drafting pool was divided between the broadcasts of both shows, with up to 30 picks allotted on ''SmackDown'' and 41 on ''Raw''. Any remaining picks from the respective draft pools were announced on WWE's website. Undrafted wrestlers (those not selected on the shows or announced via WWE.com) immediately became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing.<ref name=\"2019drafteligiblewrestlers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/article/preliminary-wwe-draft-pools|title=Preliminary WWE Draft Pools announced|date=October 10, 2019|author=[[WWE]].com Staff|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

=== ''SmackDown'' (October 11) ===
There were four rounds of draft picks during Night 1 of the 2019 draft.

==Aftermath==
Two weeks after the draft, WWE held its pay-per-view event [[Crown Jewel (2019)|Crown Jewel]]. At the event, although the two had been drafted to separate brands, Raw draftee Seth Rollins defended the Universal Championship against SmackDown draftee [[\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] in a [[falls count anywhere match]] that could not be stopped for any reason; this was a rematch from [[Hell in a Cell (2019)|Hell in a Cell]], which was a [[Hell in a Cell match]] that ended by referee stoppage. The Fiend defeated Rollins to win the Universal Championship, and the title was subsequently transferred to the SmackDown brand, resulting in SmackDown having both the Universal and [[WWE Championship]]s.<ref name=\"CrownJewel2019\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=WWE Crown Jewel results: Powell's live review of Brock Lesnar vs. Cain Velasquez for the WWE Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Bray Wyatt in a Falls Count Anywhere match for the WWE Universal Championship, Braun Strowman vs. Tyson Fury, Lacey Evans vs. Natalya|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/10/31/wwe-crown-jewel-results-powells-live-review-of-brock-lesnar-vs-cain-velasquez-for-the-wwe-championship-seth-rollins-vs-bray-wyatt-in-a-falls-count-anywhere-match-for-the-wwe-universal-championsh/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref> This was quickly fixed, however.

Although the Wild Card Rule had ended with the 2019 draft, the theme of the next big pay-per-view, Survivor Series, has been brand supremacy since 2016, which would see the brands invading each others shows in the build up to the event. Just prior to the draft, WWE's [[Farm team|developmental territory]] NXT was promoted to being WWE's third major brand and it was subsequently added to the 2019 Survivor Series brand competition. This in turn resulted in wrestlers from the three brands invading each others shows to build matches for the event.

[[Marriage in the United States|Like marriage]], '''divorce in the United States''' is under the jurisdiction of [[state governments in the United States|state governments]], not the [[U.S. government|federal government]]. [[Divorce]] or \"dissolution of marriage\" is a legal process in which a judge or other authority dissolves the bonds of matrimony existing between two persons, thus restoring them to the status of being single and permitting them to marry other individuals. The legal process for divorce may also involve issues of [[alimony|spousal support]], [[child custody]], [[child support]], [[distribution of property]] and division of debt, though these matters are usually only ancillary or consequential to the dissolution of the marriage.

==History==
=== 19th century ===
By the mid- to late 19th century, divorce rates in the United States increased at a relatively rapid rate, and during that period on an annual basis Americans obtained more divorces than were granted in all of Europe.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=O'NEILL|first=WILLIAM L.|chapter=Divorce in the Progressive Era|publisher=DE GRUYTER SAUR|isbn=9783110968941|doi=10.1515/9783110968941.376|title=Domestic Relations and Law|year=1992}}</ref> One possible causes for the increased divorce rate is that lowered prices and easier ability to obtain a divorce made divorce affordable to people of limited means. Previously, divorces were mainly granted to the middle and upper-classes due to their cost. Other possible explanations include the popular acceptance of divorce as an alternative to marital unhappiness, \"the decay of the belief in immortality and future punishment\", \"the discontent with the existing constitution of society\",\"the improvement of transportation and the habits created by new mobility\", \"and the greater independence of women resulting in their enlarged legal rights and greater opportunities of self support\"<ref name=\":0\" />. The divorce rate continued to increase in the early 20th century. In 1890, 3 couples per 1,000 were divorced and by 1920, 8 couples per 1,000 were divorced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_21/sr21_024.pdf|title=100 Years of Marriage and Divorce Statistics United States, 1867-1967|last=National Center for Health Statistics|date=December 1973|website=CDC}}</ref>

The [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States]] were laws passed by the various states that gave greater property rights to women and, in some cases, allowed women to sue for divorce. 

The [[women's rights]] movement debated the issue of whether to allow divorce, with [[Jane Swisshelm]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] as early voices in favor, and [[Horace Greeley]] and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] opposed. Unlike other issues, the movement was unable to achieve agreement on this issue.<ref name=\"Danver 2011\">{{cite book | last=Danver | first=S.L. | title=Revolts, Protests, Demonstrations, and Rebellions in American History: An Encyclopedia | publisher=ABC-CLIO | series=Revolts, Protests, Demonstrations, and Rebellions in American History: An Encyclopedia | issue=v. 1 | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-59884-221-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1C4W2IVHcMC&pg=PA477 | access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref>{{rp|477}} Stanton eventually coming to the view that the reform of marriage laws was more important than [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's voting rights]].<ref>Hays, Elinor Rice.

=== 20th century ===
Prior to the latter decades of the 20th century, a spouse seeking divorce in most states had to show a \"fault\" such as abandonment, cruelty, incurable [[mental illness]], or [[adultery]]. Even in such cases, a divorce was barred in cases such as the suing spouse's [[procurement]] or [[connivance]] (contributing to the fault, such as by arranging for adultery), [[condonation]] (forgiving the fault either explicitly or by continuing to cohabit after knowing of it), or [[recrimination]] (the suing spouse also being guilty).

Because divorce was considered to be against the [[public interest]], civil courts refused to grant a divorce if evidence revealed any hint of complicity between the husband and wife to divorce, or if they attempted to manufacture grounds for a divorce. Divorce was granted only because one party to the marriage had violated a sacred [[vow]] to the \"innocent spouse.\" If both husband and wife were guilty, \"neither would be allowed to escape the bonds of marriage.\"<ref>Kent's Commentaries on American Law, p. 401.</ref>

A number of strategies were devised in several states to make divorce easier to obtain. By 1909, [[Reno, Nevada]] was \"the divorce capital of the world.\" At that time, only six months in Nevada were sufficient to establish Nevada residency, and the Nevada courts, well aware of the contribution of divorce seekers to Nevada's [[hospitality industry]], accepted the resident's uncorroborated statement that grounds for divorce, usually \"extreme cruelty,\" existed. In 1927, the Nevada Legislature, \"in response to a perceived threat to Reno's divorce supremacy from France and Mexico and a divorce-trade war that had been going on since the end of World War I between Nevada, Idaho, and Arkansas,\" changed the residency period to three months, and in 1931, the same Legislature that voted in \"wide-open gambling\" dropped it to six weeks.<ref>Reno Divorce History, \"Laws of the Land\", http://renodivorcehistory.org/themes/law-of-the-land/, consulted July 28, 2017.</ref> Providing accommodations and other amenities for visitors, who could not leave Nevada during the six weeks, became a major Reno industry; greeters met the arriving trains, and there were a variety of [[dude ranch|divorce ranches]].<ref>{{cite news

By the 1960s, the use of collusive or deceptive practices to bypass the fault system had become a widespread concern, if not actually a widespread practice, and there was widespread agreement that something had to change. The [[National Association of Women Lawyers]] was instrumental in convincing the [[American Bar Association]] to help create a Family Law section in many state courts, and pushed strongly for no-fault divorce law around 1960 (cf. [[Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act]]). In 1969, California became the first U.S. state to pass a [[no-fault divorce]] law.<ref name=\"Evans\"/>

The [[National Center for Health Statistics]] reports that from 1975 to 1988 in the US, in families with children present, wives file for divorce in approximately two-thirds of cases.

The median length for a marriage in the US today is 11 years with 90% of all divorces being settled out of court. However, studies have shown that lower-income couples are currently more likely to get a divorce than higher-income couples.

Divorce in the U.S. is governed by state rather than federal law. The laws of the state(s) of residence at the time of divorce govern, not those of the location where the couple was married. All states recognize divorces granted by any other state. All states impose a minimum time of residence to file for a divorce,<ref name=\"ABAgrounds\">{{cite journal|title=Family Law in the Fifty States, Chart 4: Grounds for Divorce and Residency Requirements|journal=Family Law Quarterly|date=Winter 2012|volume=45|issue=4|page=500|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/family_law_quarterly/vol45/4win12_chart4_divorce.authcheckdam.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref> [[Nevada]] and [[Idaho]] currently being the shortest at six weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nevada Revised Statutes, Sec. 125.020|url=https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-125.html#NRS125Sec020|website=Nevada Legislature|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title32/T32CH7/SECT32-701/|title=Section 32-701 – Idaho State Legislature|website=legislature.idaho.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref>

All states allow no-fault divorce on grounds such as irreconcilable differences, irremediable breakdown, and loss of affection. Some states mandate a separation period before no-fault divorce.

Since the mid-1990s, a few states have enacted [[covenant marriage]] laws, which allow couples to voluntarily make a divorce more difficult for themselves to obtain than usual. For example, couples who choose to undertake a covenant marriage may be required to undergo counseling before a divorce can be granted, or to submit their conflicts to [[mediation]]. In states lacking such provisions, some couples sign contracts undertaking the same obligations.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A summary (or simple) divorce, available in some jurisdictions, is used when spouses meet certain eligibility requirements, or can agree on key issues beforehand. For example, in order to qualify for summary divorce in California, a couple must meet all of the following requirements:
* Have been married less than five years,
* Have no children together,
* Do not own any real property,
* Do not rent any real property other than current dwelling,
* Do not owe more than $6,000 for debts since date of marriage,
* Own less than $41,000 in community property (property acquired during marriage), not counting vehicles,
* Do not own more than $41,000 in separate property (property acquired before marriage), not counting vehicles,
* Agree to forgo spousal support,
* Have a signed agreement which divides property (including cars) and debts, and
* Meet residency requirement, if applicable.<ref name=\"Cal Summary Divorce\">{{cite web|title=For Married Couples|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/1241.htm|website=California Courts: Judicial Branch of California|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>

===Grounds for divorce===
{{Main|Grounds for divorce (United States)}}
Though divorce laws vary between [[jurisdiction]],<ref name=\"ABAgrounds\"/> there are two basic approaches to divorce: fault-based and no-fault. Fault grounds, when available, are sometimes still sought. This may be done where it reduces the waiting period otherwise required, or possibly in hopes of affecting decisions related to a divorce, such as child custody, child support, alimony, and so on. A court may still take into account the behavior of the parties when dividing property, debts, evaluating custody, and support. States vary in the admissibility of such evidence for those decisions.

====No-fault divorce====
Under a [[no-fault divorce]] system the dissolution of a marriage does not require an allegation or proof of fault of either party. Only three states (Mississippi, South Dakota and Tennessee) require mutual consent (in Tennessee it is needed only in certain circumstances) for a no-fault divorce to be granted.<ref name=\"Evans\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/><ref name=\"selegal1\"/> No-fault [[grounds for divorce]] include incompatibility, irreconcilable differences, and irremediable breakdown of the marriage.

====At-fault divorce====
Fault divorces used to be the only way to break a marriage, and people who had differences, but did not qualify as \"at fault\", only had the option to separate (and were prevented from legally remarrying).

However, there are ways (defenses) to prevent a fault divorce:
* [[Collusion]]
* [[Condonation]]
* [[Connivance]]
* [[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]]
* [[Recrimination]]

A defense is expensive, and not usually practical as eventually most divorces are granted.

Comparative rectitude is a doctrine used to determine which spouse is more at fault when both spouses are guilty of breaches.

===Jurisdiction===
In the United States, the Federal Government does not have the authority to issue a divorce. The state has the only authority over issuing accepting a marriage, and issuing a divorce. This creates the question of which state can one get divorced in. All states have rules for jurisdiction, which is typically a time frame the person filing the divorce has lived in the state.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Grounds for Divorce and Residency Requirements|journal=Family Law Quarterly|date=Winter 2012|volume=45|issue=4|page=500|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/family_law_quarterly/vol45/4win12_chart4_divorce.authcheckdam.pdf|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> Most states require the person filing for a divorce to be a physical resident of the state for six months. Some states require twelve months and some states, like Nevada, only require six weeks. Without proper jurisdiction a state cannot issue a divorce.

===Property division and spousal support===
States vary in their rules for division of assets in a divorce. The major difference is between states that use a [[community property]] system and states that do not. In community property states, community property belongs to the spouses equally.<ref name=\"Wex community property\">{{cite web|last1=Wex|title=Community property|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/community_property|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=23 July 2016|date=2009-09-25}}</ref> The following states use community property regimes: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Alaskan law gives couples the option to create community property by written agreement.<ref>{{cite web|title=In 9 US states, a divorce means you'll lose half of everything you own — here's why|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/states-where-you-lose-half-in-divorce-2016-11|website=Business Insider|accessdate=6 January 2018|author=Tanza Loudenback|date=January 5, 2018}}</ref>

Most community property states start with the presumption that community assets will be divided equally, whereas \"equitable distribution\" states presume fairness may dictate more or less than half of the assets will be awarded to one spouse or the other. Commonly, assets acquired before marriage are considered individual, and assets acquired after, marital. Depending on the state, an equitable or equal division of assets is then sought.<ref name=\"Sterling community property\">{{cite web|title=Community Property Division Worksheet|url=http://www.sterlinglawyers.com/wisconsin/property-division/worksheet/|website=Sterling Law Offices, S.C.|accessdate = 2017-02-07|date=2017-02-03}}</ref>

In some states, educational degrees earned during the marriage may be considered marital property. In such states, a resolution of the divorce will often entail payment from the educated spouse to the other spouse a share of their expected future earnings that are due to a degree they earned during the marriage,<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324481204578180132637628330|title = After Divorce, a Degree Is Costly|last = Hollander|first = Sophia|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|issn = 0099-9660|access-date = 2016-03-07}}</ref> and may require the expertise of labor economists or other statistical and financial experts.

[[Alimony]], also known as 'maintenance' or 'spousal support' is still being granted in many cases, especially in longer term marriages. Alimony is more likely in cases where a spouse has remedial needs that must be met in order for the spouse to become fully employable, for example that one spouse gave up career opportunities or development in order to devote themselves to the family.

===Child support and custody===
In cases involving children, governments have a pressing interest in ensuring that disputes between parents do not spill over into the family courts. All states now require parents to file a [[parenting plan]], or to decide on custody and visitation either by reaching a written agreement or in a court hearing, when they legally separate or divorce.

The spouse given custody (or the spouse with the greater share of residence time in the case of joint custody), may receive assets to compensate their greater child-care expenses.

===Alternatives to litigation===

====Collaborative divorce====
[[Collaborative divorce]] ([[uncontested divorce]]) is becoming a popular method for divorcing couples to come to agreement on divorce issues. In a collaborative divorce, the parties negotiate an agreed resolution with the assistance of attorneys who are trained in the collaborative divorce process and in mediation, and often with the assistance of a neutral financial specialist and/or divorce coach. The parties are empowered to make their own decisions based on their own needs and interests, but with complete information and full professional support. Once the collaborative divorce starts, the lawyers are disqualified from representing the parties in a contested legal proceeding, should the [[collaborative law]] process end prematurely. Most attorneys who practice collaborative divorce claim that it can be substantially less expensive than other divorce methods (regular divorce or mediation). However, should the parties not reach any agreements, any documents or information exchanged during the collaborative process cannot later be used in further legal proceedings, as the collaborative process is confidential proceedings. Furthermore, there are no set enforceable time lines for completion of a divorce using collaborative divorce.

====Mediated divorce====
Divorce mediation is an alternative to traditional divorce litigation that attempts to help opposing spouses find common ground during the divorce process.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Joan B.|title=A Decade of Divorce Mediation Research: Some Questions and Answers|journal=Family Court Review|date=July 1996|issue=34|pages=373–385|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-97933-000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Marian|title=Mediation in Family Disputes: Principles of Practice|date=1 December 2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781317098478|pages=1–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8okWDAAAQBAJ|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> In a divorce mediation session, a mediator facilitates the discussion between the husband and wife by assisting with communication and providing information and suggestions to help resolve differences. At the end of the mediation process, the separating parties will have typically developed a tailored divorce agreement that they can submit to the court. Parties to mediation do not need to retain attorneys. However, if the parties choose to retain attorneys their attorneys may be included in the mediation session. The mediator can provide both parties with information but will not offer advice to either. Divorce mediators may be attorneys, mental health professionals, or financial experts who have experience in divorce cases. Divorce mediation can be significantly less expensive than litigation. The adherence rate to mediated agreements is much higher than that of adherence to court orders.

====Summary divorce====

Many states allow for couples to file for a summary divorce based upon a jointly filed divorce petition. A summary divorce means the spouses have discussed the terms required by state law to issue a divorce and they have reached an mutual agreement. Almost, every state allow for this type of \"uncontested\" divorce.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Summary Divorce Form|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl800.pdf|website=California Courts|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Florida Simplified Resolution Form|url=http://www.flcourts.org/core/fileparse.php/293/urlt/901a.pdf|website=Florida Courts|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> An uncontested joint divorce petition will often save a divorcing couple both time and money.

===Federal laws relating to divorce===
Since the 1980s, federal legislation has been enacted affecting the rights and responsibilities of divorcing spouses. For example, federal [[welfare reform]] mandated the creation of [[child support]] guidelines in all 50 states in the 1980s. [[ERISA]] includes provisions for the division of qualified retirement accounts between divorcing spouses. The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] established rules on ignoring alimony as a source of taxable income. Federal bankruptcy laws prohibit discharging in bankruptcy of alimony and child support obligations. [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] allows a divorced spouse to obtain and maintain health insurance.

==== Qualified Domestic Relations Orders ====

{{main|Qualified domestic relations order}}

A \"[[qualified domestic relations order]]\" (QDRO) is an order that creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to receive, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to receive, all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a retirement plan, and that includes certain information and meets certain other requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=QDRO's - An Overview|url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/qdro-overview|website=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=5 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227004154/https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/qdro-overview|archive-date=December 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A domestic relations order is a judgment, decree, or order (including the approval of a property settlement) that is made pursuant to state domestic relations law (including community property law) and that relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights for the benefit of a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant.

A state authority, generally a court, must actually issue a judgment, order, or decree or otherwise formally approve a property settlement agreement before it can be a domestic relations order under ERISA. The mere fact that a property settlement is agreed to and signed by the parties will not, in and of itself, cause the agreement to be a domestic relations order.

According to a study published in the American Law and Economics Review, women file slightly more than two-thirds of divorce cases in the US.<ref>

There is some variation among states, and the numbers have also varied over time, with about 60% of filings by women in most of the 20th century, and over 70% by women in some states just after no-fault divorce was introduced, according to the paper.

In their 1997 study titled \"Child Custody Policies and Divorce Rates in the US,\" Kuhn and Guidubaldi find it reasonable to conclude that women anticipate advantages to being single, rather than remaining married.<ref>

States whose family law policies, statutes, or judicial practice encourage joint custody have shown a greater decline in their divorce rates than those that favor sole custody.

===Rates of divorce===
[[File:Marriage and Divorce Rates in the US 1990-2007.png|thumbnail|Marriage and divorce rates in the US 1990-2007]]
\"Rate of divorce\" usually refers to the number of divorces that occur in the population during a given period. However it is also used in common parlance to refer to the likelihood of a given marriage ending in divorce (as opposed to the death of a spouse).

In 2002 (latest survey data as of 2012),<ref name=cdcmain>{{cite web|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=D Listing, Key Statistics from the National Survey of Family Growth|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/abc_list_d.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> 29% of first marriages among women aged 15–44 were disrupted (ended in separation, divorce or annulment) within 10 years.<ref name=dhhs05>{{cite book|title=Fertility, Family Planning, and Reproductive Health of U.S.Women: Data From the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth|date=November 2005|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|location=Hyattsville, Maryland|pages=17, 90|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_025.pdf|author=Chandra A|author2=Martinez GM|author3=Mosher WD|author4=Abma JC|author5=Jones J|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> Beyond the 10-year window, population survey data is lacking, but forecasts and estimates provide some understanding. It is commonly claimed that half of all marriages in the United States eventually end in divorce, an estimate possibly based on the fact that in any given year, the number of marriages is about twice the number of divorces.<ref name=truthorfiction>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Fifty Percent of American Marriages End in Divorce-Fiction! | url = http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/d/divorce.htm | publisher = | accessdate = February 26, 2010 }}</ref> Amato outlined in his study on divorce that in the late of 1990s, about 43% to 46% of marriages were predicted to end in dissolution. According to his research, there is only a small percentage of marriages end in permanent separation rather than divorce.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Amato|title=Research on Divorce: Continuing Trends and New Developments.|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=72|issue=3|pages=650–666|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00723.x|year=2010}}</ref> Using 1995 data, National Survey of Family Growth forecast in 2002 a 43% chance that first marriages among women aged 15–44 would be disrupted within 15 years.<ref name=cdcmain/> More recently, having spoken with academics and National Survey of Family Growth representatives, [[PolitiFact.com]] estimated in 2012 that the lifelong probability of a marriage ending in divorce is 40%–50%.<ref>{{cite web|last=PolitiFact New Jersey|title=Steve Sweeney claims two-thirds of marriages end in divorce|url=http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/20/stephen-sweeney/steve-sweeney-claims-more-two-thirds-marriages-end/|work=Truth-O-Meter|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref>

A 2008 study by Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King conducted on behalf of the [[Education Resources Information Center]] examined whether crossing racial boundaries increased the risk of divorce.<ref name=\"ERIC\">{{cite journal|last=Bratter|first=Jenifer L.|title=\"But Will It Last?\": Marital Instability among Interracial and Same-Race Couples|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2008.00491.x|volume=57|issue = 2|journal=Family Relations|pages=160–171|year = 2008}}</ref> Using the 2002 [[National Survey of Family Growth]] (Cycle VI), the likelihood of divorce for interracial couples to that of same-race couples was compared. Comparisons across marriage cohorts revealed that, overall, interracial couples have higher rates of divorce, particularly for those that married during the late 1980s.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> The authors found that gender plays a significant role in interracial divorce dynamics: According to the adjusted models predicting divorce as of the 10th year of marriage, interracial marriages that are the most vulnerable involve White females and non-White males (with the exception of White females/Hispanic White males) relative to White/White couples.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> White wife/Black husband marriages are twice as likely to divorce by the 10th year of marriage compared to White/White couples.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> Conversely, White men/non-White women couples show either very little or no differences in divorce rates.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> Asian wife/White husband marriages show only 4% greater likelihood of divorce by the 10th year of marriage than White/White couples.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> In the case of Black wife/White husband marriages, divorce by the 10th year of marriage is 44% less likely than among White/White unions.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> Intermarriages that did not cross a racial barrier, which was the case for White/Hispanic White couples, showed statistically similar likelihoods of divorcing as White/White marriages.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />

A 2011 study at the University of Iowa found that a woman's loss of virginity before age 18 was correlated with a greater number of occurrences of divorce within the first 10 years of marriage.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marcus|first=Stephanie|title=Women Who Lost Virginity Early More Likely To Divorce: New Study|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/15/virginity-teens-divorce-study_n_877529.html|accessdate=October 28, 2011|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=June 15, 2011}}</ref>

A 2012 study cited by Pew Research center found that an estimated 78% of women with bachelor's degrees, and 65% of men with bachelor's degrees who married between 2006-2010 can expect their marriages to last at least two decades. Women with a high school degree or less, on the other hand, face a meager 40% probability of their marriages surviving the same period.<ref>{{Cite web|title = This subset of women has the best odds of making a marriage last|url = http://qz.com/567376/this-subset-of-women-has-the-strongest-odds-of-making-a-marriage-last/|website = Quartz|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}</ref>

Studies have shown that men who \"earn high incomes have a decreased probability of getting a divorce\". However, higher income makes a woman's chances of marriage less likely and it has no connection to possible divorces.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aughinbaugh | first1 = Alison | last2 = Robles | first2 = Omar | last3 = Sun | first3 = Hugette | year = 2013 | title = Marriage and divorce: patterns by gender, race, and educational attainment | url = | journal = Monthly Lab.

[[Marriage in the United States|Like marriage]], '''divorce in the United States''' is under the jurisdiction of [[state governments in the United States|state governments]], not the [[U.S. government|federal government]]. [[Divorce]] or \"dissolution of marriage\" is a legal process in which a judge or other authority dissolves the bonds of matrimony existing between two persons, thus restoring them to the status of being single and permitting them to marry other individuals. The legal process for divorce may also involve issues of [[alimony|spousal support]], [[child custody]], [[child support]], [[distribution of property]] and division of debt, though these matters are usually only ancillary or consequential to the dissolution of the marriage.

==History==
=== 19th century ===
By the mid- to late 19th century, divorce rates in the United States increased at a relatively rapid rate, and during that period on an annual basis Americans obtained more divorces than were granted in all of Europe.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=O'NEILL|first=WILLIAM L.|chapter=Divorce in the Progressive Era|publisher=DE GRUYTER SAUR|isbn=9783110968941|doi=10.1515/9783110968941.376|title=Domestic Relations and Law|year=1992}}</ref> One possible causes for the increased divorce rate is that lowered prices and easier ability to obtain a divorce made divorce affordable to people of limited means. Previously, divorces were mainly granted to the middle and upper-classes due to their cost. Other possible explanations include the popular acceptance of divorce as an alternative to marital unhappiness, \"the decay of the belief in immortality and future punishment\", \"the discontent with the existing constitution of society\",\"the improvement of transportation and the habits created by new mobility\", \"and the greater independence of women resulting in their enlarged legal rights and greater opportunities of self support\"<ref name=\":0\" />. The divorce rate continued to increase in the early 20th century. In 1890, 3 couples per 1,000 were divorced and by 1920, 8 couples per 1,000 were divorced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_21/sr21_024.pdf|title=100 Years of Marriage and Divorce Statistics United States, 1867-1967|last=National Center for Health Statistics|date=December 1973|website=CDC}}</ref>

The [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States]] were laws passed by the various states that gave greater property rights to women and, in some cases, allowed women to sue for divorce. 

The [[women's rights]] movement debated the issue of whether to allow divorce, with [[Jane Swisshelm]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] as early voices in favor, and [[Horace Greeley]] and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] opposed. Unlike other issues, the movement was unable to achieve agreement on this issue.<ref name=\"Danver 2011\">{{cite book | last=Danver | first=S.L. | title=Revolts, Protests, Demonstrations, and Rebellions in American History: An Encyclopedia | publisher=ABC-CLIO | series=Revolts, Protests, Demonstrations, and Rebellions in American History: An Encyclopedia | issue=v. 1 | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-59884-221-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1C4W2IVHcMC&pg=PA477 | access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref>{{rp|477}} Stanton eventually coming to the view that the reform of marriage laws was more important than [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's voting rights]].<ref>Hays, Elinor Rice.

=== 20th century ===
Prior to the latter decades of the 20th century, a spouse seeking divorce in most states had to show a \"fault\" such as abandonment, cruelty, incurable [[mental illness]], or [[adultery]]. Even in such cases, a divorce was barred in cases such as the suing spouse's [[procurement]] or [[connivance]] (contributing to the fault, such as by arranging for adultery), [[condonation]] (forgiving the fault either explicitly or by continuing to cohabit after knowing of it), or [[recrimination]] (the suing spouse also being guilty).

Because divorce was considered to be against the [[public interest]], civil courts refused to grant a divorce if evidence revealed any hint of complicity between the husband and wife to divorce, or if they attempted to manufacture grounds for a divorce. Divorce was granted only because one party to the marriage had violated a sacred [[vow]] to the \"innocent spouse.\" If both husband and wife were guilty, \"neither would be allowed to escape the bonds of marriage.\"<ref>Kent's Commentaries on American Law, p. 401.</ref>

A number of strategies were devised in several states to make divorce easier to obtain. By 1909, [[Reno, Nevada]] was \"the divorce capital of the world.\" At that time, only six months in Nevada were sufficient to establish Nevada residency, and the Nevada courts, well aware of the contribution of divorce seekers to Nevada's [[hospitality industry]], accepted the resident's uncorroborated statement that grounds for divorce, usually \"extreme cruelty,\" existed. In 1927, the Nevada Legislature, \"in response to a perceived threat to Reno's divorce supremacy from France and Mexico and a divorce-trade war that had been going on since the end of World War I between Nevada, Idaho, and Arkansas,\" changed the residency period to three months, and in 1931, the same Legislature that voted in \"wide-open gambling\" dropped it to six weeks.<ref>Reno Divorce History, \"Laws of the Land\", http://renodivorcehistory.org/themes/law-of-the-land/, consulted July 28, 2017.</ref> Providing accommodations and other amenities for visitors, who could not leave Nevada during the six weeks, became a major Reno industry; greeters met the arriving trains, and there were a variety of [[dude ranch|divorce ranches]].<ref>{{cite news

By the 1960s, the use of collusive or deceptive practices to bypass the fault system had become a widespread concern, if not actually a widespread practice, and there was widespread agreement that something had to change. The [[National Association of Women Lawyers]] was instrumental in convincing the [[American Bar Association]] to help create a Family Law section in many state courts, and pushed strongly for no-fault divorce law around 1960 (cf. [[Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act]]). In 1969, California became the first U.S. state to pass a [[no-fault divorce]] law.<ref name=\"Evans\"/>

The [[National Center for Health Statistics]] reports that from 1975 to 1988 in the US, in families with children present, wives file for divorce in approximately two-thirds of cases. In 1975, 71.4% of the cases were filed by women, and in 1988, 65% were filed by women.<ref>{{cite journal |date=May 21, 1991 |title=Advance Report of Final Divorce Statistics, 1988 |journal=Monthly Vital Statistice Report |volume=39 |issue=12 (supplement 2) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/mvsr/supp/mv39_12s2.pdf }}</ref>

The median length for a marriage in the US today is 11 years with 90% of all divorces being settled out of court. However, studies have shown that lower-income couples are currently more likely to get a divorce than higher-income couples. Based on seventh-anniversary data, the divorce rate among highly educated people who married in the early 2000s is 11%. The divorce rate for couples without college degrees is 17%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Claire C.|title=The Divorce Surge Is Over, but the Myth Lives On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/upshot/the-divorce-surge-is-over-but-the-myth-lives-on.html|accessdate=4 October 2017|work=New York Times|date=2 December 2014}}</ref>

Divorce in the U.S. is governed by state rather than federal law. The laws of the state(s) of residence at the time of divorce govern, not those of the location where the couple was married.

All states allow no-fault divorce on grounds such as irreconcilable differences, irremediable breakdown, and loss of affection. Some states mandate a separation period before no-fault divorce.

Since the mid-1990s, a few states have enacted [[covenant marriage]] laws, which allow couples to voluntarily make a divorce more difficult for themselves to obtain than usual. For example, couples who choose to undertake a covenant marriage may be required to undergo counseling before a divorce can be granted, or to submit their conflicts to [[mediation]]. In states lacking such provisions, some couples sign contracts undertaking the same obligations.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A summary (or simple) divorce, available in some jurisdictions, is used when spouses meet certain eligibility requirements, or can agree on key issues beforehand. For example, in order to qualify for summary divorce in California, a couple must meet all of the following requirements:
* Have been married less than five years,
* Have no children together,
* Do not own any real property,
* Do not rent any real property other than current dwelling,
* Do not owe more than $6,000 for debts since date of marriage,
* Own less than $41,000 in community property (property acquired during marriage), not counting vehicles,
* Do not own more than $41,000 in separate property (property acquired before marriage), not counting vehicles,
* Agree to forgo spousal support,
* Have a signed agreement which divides property (including cars) and debts, and
* Meet residency requirement, if applicable.<ref name=\"Cal Summary Divorce\">{{cite web|title=For Married Couples|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/1241.htm|website=California Courts: Judicial Branch of California|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>

===Grounds for divorce===
{{Main|Grounds for divorce (United States)}}
Though divorce laws vary between [[jurisdiction]],<ref name=\"ABAgrounds\"/> there are two basic approaches to divorce: fault-based and no-fault. Fault grounds, when available, are sometimes still sought. This may be done where it reduces the waiting period otherwise required, or possibly in hopes of affecting decisions related to a divorce, such as child custody, child support, alimony, and so on. A court may still take into account the behavior of the parties when dividing property, debts, evaluating custody, and support. States vary in the admissibility of such evidence for those decisions.

====No-fault divorce====
Under a [[no-fault divorce]] system the dissolution of a marriage does not require an allegation or proof of fault of either party. Only three states (Mississippi, South Dakota and Tennessee) require mutual consent (in Tennessee it is needed only in certain circumstances) for a no-fault divorce to be granted.<ref name=\"Evans\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/><ref name=\"selegal1\"/> No-fault [[grounds for divorce]] include incompatibility, irreconcilable differences, and irremediable breakdown of the marriage.

====At-fault divorce====
Fault divorces used to be the only way to break a marriage, and people who had differences, but did not qualify as \"at fault\", only had the option to separate (and were prevented from legally remarrying).

However, there are ways (defenses) to prevent a fault divorce:
* [[Collusion]]
* [[Condonation]]
* [[Connivance]]
* [[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]]
* [[Recrimination]]

A defense is expensive, and not usually practical as eventually most divorces are granted.

Comparative rectitude is a doctrine used to determine which spouse is more at fault when both spouses are guilty of breaches.

===Jurisdiction===
In the United States, the Federal Government does not have the authority to issue a divorce. The state has the only authority over issuing accepting a marriage, and issuing a divorce. This creates the question of which state can one get divorced in. All states have rules for jurisdiction, which is typically a time frame the person filing the divorce has lived in the state.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Grounds for Divorce and Residency Requirements|journal=Family Law Quarterly|date=Winter 2012|volume=45|issue=4|page=500|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/family_law_quarterly/vol45/4win12_chart4_divorce.authcheckdam.pdf|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> Most states require the person filing for a divorce to be a physical resident of the state for six months. Some states require twelve months and some states, like Nevada, only require six weeks. Without proper jurisdiction a state cannot issue a divorce.

===Property division and spousal support===
States vary in their rules for division of assets in a divorce. The major difference is between states that use a [[community property]] system and states that do not. In community property states, community property belongs to the spouses equally.<ref name=\"Wex community property\">{{cite web|last1=Wex|title=Community property|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/community_property|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=23 July 2016|date=2009-09-25}}</ref> The following states use community property regimes: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Alaskan law gives couples the option to create community property by written agreement.<ref>{{cite web|title=In 9 US states, a divorce means you'll lose half of everything you own — here's why|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/states-where-you-lose-half-in-divorce-2016-11|website=Business Insider|accessdate=6 January 2018|author=Tanza Loudenback|date=January 5, 2018}}</ref>

Most community property states start with the presumption that community assets will be divided equally, whereas \"equitable distribution\" states presume fairness may dictate more or less than half of the assets will be awarded to one spouse or the other. Commonly, assets acquired before marriage are considered individual, and assets acquired after, marital. Depending on the state, an equitable or equal division of assets is then sought.<ref name=\"Sterling community property\">{{cite web|title=Community Property Division Worksheet|url=http://www.sterlinglawyers.com/wisconsin/property-division/worksheet/|website=Sterling Law Offices, S.C.|accessdate = 2017-02-07|date=2017-02-03}}</ref>

In some states, educational degrees earned during the marriage may be considered marital property. In such states, a resolution of the divorce will often entail payment from the educated spouse to the other spouse a share of their expected future earnings that are due to a degree they earned during the marriage,<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324481204578180132637628330|title = After Divorce, a Degree Is Costly|last = Hollander|first = Sophia|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|issn = 0099-9660|access-date = 2016-03-07}}</ref> and may require the expertise of labor economists or other statistical and financial experts.

[[Alimony]], also known as 'maintenance' or 'spousal support' is still being granted in many cases, especially in longer term marriages. Alimony is more likely in cases where a spouse has remedial needs that must be met in order for the spouse to become fully employable, for example that one spouse gave up career opportunities or development in order to devote themselves to the family.

===Child support and custody===
In cases involving children, governments have a pressing interest in ensuring that disputes between parents do not spill over into the family courts. All states now require parents to file a [[parenting plan]], or to decide on custody and visitation either by reaching a written agreement or in a court hearing, when they legally separate or divorce.

The spouse given custody (or the spouse with the greater share of residence time in the case of joint custody), may receive assets to compensate their greater child-care expenses.

===Alternatives to litigation===

====Collaborative divorce====
[[Collaborative divorce]] ([[uncontested divorce]]) is becoming a popular method for divorcing couples to come to agreement on divorce issues. In a collaborative divorce, the parties negotiate an agreed resolution with the assistance of attorneys who are trained in the collaborative divorce process and in mediation, and often with the assistance of a neutral financial specialist and/or divorce coach. The parties are empowered to make their own decisions based on their own needs and interests, but with complete information and full professional support. Once the collaborative divorce starts, the lawyers are disqualified from representing the parties in a contested legal proceeding, should the [[collaborative law]] process end prematurely. Most attorneys who practice collaborative divorce claim that it can be substantially less expensive than other divorce methods (regular divorce or mediation). However, should the parties not reach any agreements, any documents or information exchanged during the collaborative process cannot later be used in further legal proceedings, as the collaborative process is confidential proceedings. Furthermore, there are no set enforceable time lines for completion of a divorce using collaborative divorce.

====Mediated divorce====
Divorce mediation is an alternative to traditional divorce litigation that attempts to help opposing spouses find common ground during the divorce process.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Joan B.|title=A Decade of Divorce Mediation Research: Some Questions and Answers|journal=Family Court Review|date=July 1996|issue=34|pages=373–385|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-97933-000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Marian|title=Mediation in Family Disputes: Principles of Practice|date=1 December 2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781317098478|pages=1–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8okWDAAAQBAJ|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> In a divorce mediation session, a mediator facilitates the discussion between the husband and wife by assisting with communication and providing information and suggestions to help resolve differences. At the end of the mediation process, the separating parties will have typically developed a tailored divorce agreement that they can submit to the court. Parties to mediation do not need to retain attorneys. However, if the parties choose to retain attorneys their attorneys may be included in the mediation session. The mediator can provide both parties with information but will not offer advice to either. Divorce mediators may be attorneys, mental health professionals, or financial experts who have experience in divorce cases. Divorce mediation can be significantly less expensive than litigation. The adherence rate to mediated agreements is much higher than that of adherence to court orders.

====Summary divorce====

Many states allow for couples to file for a summary divorce based upon a jointly filed divorce petition. A summary divorce means the spouses have discussed the terms required by state law to issue a divorce and they have reached an mutual agreement. Almost, every state allow for this type of \"uncontested\" divorce.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Summary Divorce Form|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl800.pdf|website=California Courts|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Florida Simplified Resolution Form|url=http://www.flcourts.org/core/fileparse.php/293/urlt/901a.pdf|website=Florida Courts|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> An uncontested joint divorce petition will often save a divorcing couple both time and money.

===Federal laws relating to divorce===
Since the 1980s, federal legislation has been enacted affecting the rights and responsibilities of divorcing spouses. For example, federal [[welfare reform]] mandated the creation of [[child support]] guidelines in all 50 states in the 1980s. [[ERISA]] includes provisions for the division of qualified retirement accounts between divorcing spouses. The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] established rules on ignoring alimony as a source of taxable income. Federal bankruptcy laws prohibit discharging in bankruptcy of alimony and child support obligations. [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] allows a divorced spouse to obtain and maintain health insurance.

==== Qualified Domestic Relations Orders ====

{{main|Qualified domestic relations order}}

A \"[[qualified domestic relations order]]\" (QDRO) is an order that creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to receive, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to receive, all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a retirement plan, and that includes certain information and meets certain other requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=QDRO's - An Overview|url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/qdro-overview|website=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=5 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227004154/https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/qdro-overview|archive-date=December 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A domestic relations order is a judgment, decree, or order (including the approval of a property settlement) that is made pursuant to state domestic relations law (including community property law) and that relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights for the benefit of a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant.

A state authority, generally a court, must actually issue a judgment, order, or decree or otherwise formally approve a property settlement agreement before it can be a domestic relations order under ERISA. The mere fact that a property settlement is agreed to and signed by the parties will not, in and of itself, cause the agreement to be a domestic relations order.

There is some variation among states, and the numbers have also varied over time, with about 60% of filings by women in most of the 20th century, and over 70% by women in some states just after no-fault divorce was introduced, according to the paper.

In their 1997 study titled \"Child Custody Policies and Divorce Rates in the US,\" Kuhn and Guidubaldi find it reasonable to conclude that women anticipate advantages to being single, rather than remaining married.<ref>

States whose family law policies, statutes, or judicial practice encourage joint custody have shown a greater decline in their divorce rates than those that favor sole custody.

===Rates of divorce===
[[File:Marriage and Divorce Rates in the US 1990-2007.png|thumbnail|Marriage and divorce rates in the US 1990-2007]]
\"Rate of divorce\" usually refers to the number of divorces that occur in the population during a given period. However it is also used in common parlance to refer to the likelihood of a given marriage ending in divorce (as opposed to the death of a spouse).

In 2002 (latest survey data as of 2012),<ref name=cdcmain>{{cite web|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=D Listing, Key Statistics from the National Survey of Family Growth|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/abc_list_d.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> 29% of first marriages among women aged 15–44 were disrupted (ended in separation, divorce or annulment) within 10 years.<ref name=dhhs05>{{cite book|title=Fertility, Family Planning, and Reproductive Health of U.S.Women: Data From the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth|date=November 2005|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|location=Hyattsville, Maryland|pages=17, 90|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_025.pdf|author=Chandra A|author2=Martinez GM|author3=Mosher WD|author4=Abma JC|author5=Jones J|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> Beyond the 10-year window, population survey data is lacking, but forecasts and estimates provide some understanding. It is commonly claimed that half of all marriages in the United States eventually end in divorce, an estimate possibly based on the fact that in any given year, the number of marriages is about twice the number of divorces.<ref name=truthorfiction>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Fifty Percent of American Marriages End in Divorce-Fiction! | url = http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/d/divorce.htm | publisher = | accessdate = February 26, 2010 }}</ref> Amato outlined in his study on divorce that in the late of 1990s, about 43% to 46% of marriages were predicted to end in dissolution. According to his research, there is only a small percentage of marriages end in permanent separation rather than divorce.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Amato|title=Research on Divorce: Continuing Trends and New Developments.|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=72|issue=3|pages=650–666|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00723.x|year=2010}}</ref> Using 1995 data, National Survey of Family Growth forecast in 2002 a 43% chance that first marriages among women aged 15–44 would be disrupted within 15 years.<ref name=cdcmain/> More recently, having spoken with academics and National Survey of Family Growth representatives, [[PolitiFact.com]] estimated in 2012 that the lifelong probability of a marriage ending in divorce is 40%–50%.<ref>{{cite web|last=PolitiFact New Jersey|title=Steve Sweeney claims two-thirds of marriages end in divorce|url=http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/20/stephen-sweeney/steve-sweeney-claims-more-two-thirds-marriages-end/|work=Truth-O-Meter|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref>

A 2008 study by Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King conducted on behalf of the [[Education Resources Information Center]] examined whether crossing racial boundaries increased the risk of divorce.<ref name=\"ERIC\">{{cite journal|last=Bratter|first=Jenifer L.|title=\"But Will It Last?\": Marital Instability among Interracial and Same-Race Couples|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2008.00491.x|volume=57|issue = 2|journal=Family Relations|pages=160–171|year = 2008}}</ref> Using the 2002 [[National Survey of Family Growth]] (Cycle VI), the likelihood of divorce for interracial couples to that of same-race couples was compared. Comparisons across marriage cohorts revealed that, overall, interracial couples have higher rates of divorce, particularly for those that married during the late 1980s.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> The authors found that gender plays a significant role in interracial divorce dynamics: According to the adjusted models predicting divorce as of the 10th year of marriage, interracial marriages that are the most vulnerable involve White females and non-White males (with the exception of White females/Hispanic White males) relative to White/White couples.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> White wife/Black husband marriages are twice as likely to divorce by the 10th year of marriage compared to White/White couples.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> Conversely, White men/non-White women couples show either very little or no differences in divorce rates.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> Asian wife/White husband marriages show only 4% greater likelihood of divorce by the 10th year of marriage than White/White couples.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> In the case of Black wife/White husband marriages, divorce by the 10th year of marriage is 44% less likely than among White/White unions.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /> Intermarriages that did not cross a racial barrier, which was the case for White/Hispanic White couples, showed statistically similar likelihoods of divorcing as White/White marriages.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />

A 2011 study at the University of Iowa found that a woman's loss of virginity before age 18 was correlated with a greater number of occurrences of divorce within the first 10 years of marriage.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marcus|first=Stephanie|title=Women Who Lost Virginity Early More Likely To Divorce: New Study|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/15/virginity-teens-divorce-study_n_877529.html|accessdate=October 28, 2011|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=June 15, 2011}}</ref>

A 2012 study cited by Pew Research center found that an estimated 78% of women with bachelor's degrees, and 65% of men with bachelor's degrees who married between 2006-2010 can expect their marriages to last at least two decades. Women with a high school degree or less, on the other hand, face a meager 40% probability of their marriages surviving the same period.<ref>{{Cite web|title = This subset of women has the best odds of making a marriage last|url = http://qz.com/567376/this-subset-of-women-has-the-strongest-odds-of-making-a-marriage-last/|website = Quartz|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}</ref>

Studies have shown that men who \"earn high incomes have a decreased probability of getting a divorce\". However, higher income makes a woman's chances of marriage less likely and it has no connection to possible divorces.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aughinbaugh | first1 = Alison | last2 = Robles | first2 = Omar | last3 = Sun | first3 = Hugette | year = 2013 | title = Marriage and divorce: patterns by gender, race, and educational attainment | url = | journal = Monthly Lab.

López Obrador defined the first three transformations as the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810-1821), the [[Reform War]] (1858-1861) and the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1917).<ref name=\"que\">{{cite web|website=BBC News Mundo|title=AMLO presidente: ¿qué es la \"Cuarta Transformación\" que propone Andrés Manuel López Obrador para México?|date=Nov 26, 2018|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020|language=es|trans-title=AMLO president: What is the \"Fourth Transformation\" proposed by Andrés Manuel López Obrador for Mexico?|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-45712329}}</ref>

==Defining the Fourth Transformation==
{{See also|Desafuero of Andrés Manuel López Obrador}}
{{quote|\"Based on what we have achieved, we will seek to undertake a peaceful and orderly transformation, yes, but no less profound than Independence, the Reformation, and the Revolution; we have not made all this effort for mere cosmetic changes, by far, and much less to stay with more of the same.\" — Andrés Manuel López Obrador<ref name=\"cuarta\">{{cite web |website=Nación 321 |title=¿Qué es la cuarta transformación de México que presume AMLO?|date=Dec 1, 2018|language=es|trans-title= What is the fourth transformation of Mexico that AMLO presumes?|url= https://www.nacion321.com/elecciones/que-es-la-cuarta-transformacion-de-mexico-que-presume-amlo}}</ref>}}

In a speech given at the end of his [[2018 Mexican general election|campaign for president]], Lopez Obrador spelled out what he means by the Fourth Transformation. He called for a nation of laws wherein nothing is outside the law and no one is above the law. He said the security services would be reformed so that no one was spied upon and religion, ideas, and the right to descent would be respected. AMLO called for a true democracy guaranteeing free elections and prison for electoral fraud. He called for an end of corruption and said the law should apply not only to government officials but also to their families. He said he would reform the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]] so that even the [[Desafuero of Andrés Manuel López Obrador|president could be prosecuted]] for corruption. He called for a [[popular consultation]] process after three years to determine whether the president should be recalled. He insisted that luxuries, such as high salaries for government officials, the presidential airplane and [[Los Pinos|official residence]], bodyguards, and presidential pensions should be cut or eliminated.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/>

AMLO also called for increased attention to the needs of rural communities, revitalization of the construction industry, improvements in the energy sector, pensions for elderly Mexicans, free medicine, and improved education with access for all.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/>

''[[Forbes|Forbes Mexico]],'' in a September 2018 article said that the Fourth Transformation presents an opportunity for Mexico to move forward as a true democracy. It could not depend on one political party and must move beyond campaign slogans. The authors, Nicola Morfini and Bernardo Sainz Martínez of the [[Instituto Panamericano de Alta Dirección de Empresa|Pan American Institute for High Business Management (IPADE)]], argue that Mexico is at a crossroads: the large margin of victory by ''[[Juntos Haremos Historia]]'' in the 2018 election makes true change possible while also highlighting the possibility of regression. They warn that if decision-making depends exclusively on [[National Regeneration Movement|National Regeneration Movement (Morena)]], the legislature could lose power as it did under the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)]]. Given the high poverty levels in the country, the authors suggest that popular democracy may be easily manipulated. They point out that many members of Morena were once members of PRI, which should have a moderating effect on political changes. Finally, they conclude that the future of Mexico depends on everyone.<ref>{{cite web|website=Forbes México|title=López Obrador hacia la cuarta transformación|author1= Nicola Morfini|author2= Bernardo Sainz Martínez|date=Sep 19, 2018|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020|language=es|trans-title= López Obrador towards the fourth transformation|url= https://www.forbes.com.mx/lopez-obrador-hacia-la-cuarta-transformacion/}}</ref>

==The first three transformations==
President Lopez Obrador cites three previous periods of transformation in [[history of Mexico]]: the Independence Movement (1810-1821), ''La Reforma'' (1858-1861), and the Mexican Revolution (1910-1917). While all three events involved extreme violence, AMLO insists that the fourth transformation be peaceful.<ref name=\"que\"/><ref name=\"cuarta\"/>

===The War of Independence===
After nearly 300 years of Spanish colonization, on the morning of September 16, 1810, Catholic priest [[Miguel Hidalgo]] called the people of [[Cry of Dolores|Dolores Hidalgo]] to take up arms against their Spanish overlords. Hidalgo took up a banner of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgin of Guadalupe]]<ref name=\"natgo\">{{cite web|website=National Geographic Culture |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2018/09/mexico-independence-day-confusion-cinco-de-mayo/|title=Mexico Independence Day: What You Need to Know|author=Heather Brady|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref> After a few battles, Hidalgo had gathered a ragtime, disorganized army of 80,000. Hidalgo's army was eventually defeated, and Hidalgo was defrocked and beheaded. His chief collaborator, [[Ignacio Allende]] was also captured and beheaded.<ref>{{cite web|website=Mexican History.com|url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Independence.htm|title= The war for Independence 1810-1821|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref>

Hidalgo's disciple, Father [[José María Morelos]] took up the struggle, winning 22 battles in nine months. Morelos convened the [[Congress of Chilpancingo]], which declared independence, abolished slavery and the [[caste]] system, and declared Catholicism the state religion. However, Morelos soon was defeated, caught, and executed.<ref name=\"jose\">{{cite web|website=Mexican History.com|title=The Independence movement after the death of Miguel Hidalgo |url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Independence.htm#jose}}</ref>

For five years, the insurgents were confined mostly to guerrilla warfare, led by [[Guadalupe Victoria]] near Puebla and [[Vicente Guerrero]] in the mountains of Oaxaca. By 1819, the Spanish viceroy, [[Juan Ruiz de Apodaca, 1st Count of Venadito|Juan Ruiz de Apodaca]] was able to report that the situation was under control.<ref name=\"jose\"/>
 
Events in Spain led to a weakening of the crown, With Guerrero, he wrote the [[Plan of Iguala]]. Iturbide, Guerrero, and Victoria marched on Mexico City; on September 27, 1821, they defeated the Spanish and Mexico consolidated its independence.<ref name=\"jose\"/>

Iturbide became [[First Mexican Empire|emperor]] of the new nation, but three years later he was deposed and a [[History of Mexico|republic]] was established with Guadalupe Victoria as its [[List of heads of state of Mexico|first president]].<ref name=\"natgo\"/>

===La Reforma===
{{Main|Reform War}}
''La Reforma'' (the Reform) was a liberal movement led by [[Benito Juárez]] in 1857 to disestablish the power of the [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Catholic Church]]; establish [[separation of Church and State]]; reduce the power of the military; and establish civil registry of births, marriages, and deaths.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/> Conservatives fought back, leading to the [[War of Reform]] (1858-1861).<ref>{{cite web|website=Global Security.org |title=1858-1861 - War of the Reform|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020 |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/mexican-reform.htm}}</ref> The liberals won the war, but the war left the country weak, and it was soon followed by the [[Second French Intervention in Mexico|French intervention]], and the establishment of the [[Second Mexican Empire]] with [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] of Austria as emperor (1864-1867). Juarez and the liberals retook power in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|website=National Geographic History Magazine |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/magazine/2018/05-06/cinco-de-mayo-history-battle-of-puebla/|title=The Victorious origins of Cinco de Mayo|author=Isabel Bueno |accessdate=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref>

===The Mexican Revolution===
{{Main|Mexican Revolution}}
After an unsuccessful electoral campaign against President and dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]], on November 20, [[1910 in Mexico|1910]], [[Francisco I. Madero]] called the Mexican people to arms. In 30 years of rule, Diaz had modernized the country and established a growing economy, but he had done so by granting numerous concessions to British and American investors while denying basic liberties to peasant farmers, miners, and workers. In a bad year, such as 1908–1909, the peasants were reduced to virtual slavery. Within six months of Madero's call to arms, Diaz had resigned and the moderate, middle-class Madero became president.<ref name=\"today\">{{cite web|website=History Today.com|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/mexican-revolution|title=The Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910, was one of the great revolutionary upheavals of the twentieth century.|author=Alan Knight|date=May 5, 1980 |volume=30|issue=5|accessdate=Jan 23, 2020}}</ref>
 
Madero's moderate reforms were not satisfactory to peasant leaders such as [[Poncho Villa]] in the north and [[Emiliano Zapata]] in the south. Fighting continued, and full warfare broke out. Madero was overthrown by the army and assassinated in early 1913 by [[Victoriano Huerta]], who after thirteen months of harsh rule and fierce fighting was overthrown and executed.<ref name=\"today\"/> There were numerous small bands led by local warlords; eventually, many of them gave up while others united under [[Venustiano Carranza]]. Carranza was able to consolidate his power, and on February 5, 1917, he published the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1917]], which many see as the end of the Mexican Revolution. However, fighting continued well into the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web |website=PBS History Detectives|title=Mexican Revolution|accessdate=Jan 23, 2020 |url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/mexican-revolution/}}</ref>

==Successes and failures==
A year after the election and seven months since he took office, President [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador|López Obrador]] stated that he had fulfilled 78 of the 100 promises he had made, including ending the [[Mexican Drug War|Drug War]]. He also said that the state has stopped being the principal [[Human rights in Mexico|human rights]] violator. He promised to end corruption and admitted that there is still a lot of work to do in questions of the economy, health, and public safety.<ref>{{cite web |website=Informador.mx|title=Afirma AMLO cumplir 78 de 100 compromisos|url=https://www.informador.mx/Afirma-AMLO-cumplir-78-de-100-compromisos-l201907020001.html|date=July 2, 2019|language=es|trans-title=AMLO affirms fulfilling 78 of 100 commitments}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===
President Lopez Obrador announced an MXN $859 billion (US$44 billion) investment plan for 147 infrastructure projects in November 2019. The investments are in highways, railways, ports, and airports as well as investments in telecommunications with most of the capital coming from the private sector. \"This is of the highest importance,\" said Lopez Obrador. \"Participation of the private sector in the country’s growth is necessary.\"<ref>{{cite web|website=Bloomberg|title=Mexico Unveils $44 Billion Infrastructure Plan to Boost GDP|author1=Andrea Navarro|author2=Justin Villamil|date=26 Nov 2019 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-26/mexico-unveils-44-billion-infrastructure-plan-to-boost-economy}} {{cite web|website=Reuters Business News|title=Mexico to spend $44 billion on infrastructure in first phase of plan|author=Sharay Angulo|date=Nov 26, 2019|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-infrastructure/mexico-to-spend-44-billion-on-infrastructure-in-first-phase-of-plan-idUSKBN1Y01UQ}}</ref>

Priority energy projects are the [[Petroleum coke|coking plant]] in [[Tula de Allende|Tula, Hidalgo]] (MXN $40 billion), the refinery in [[Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León|Cadereyta, Nuevo León]] (MXN $17 billion), and the Pemex Gas Processing Complex to the Mayakán pipeline in [[Macuspana Municipality|Macuspana, Tabasco]] (MXN $1 billion). MXN $219 is destined for the port of [[Topolobampo|Topolobampo, Sinaloa]] and the port in [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán]] is scheduled to receive MXN $41 million. MXN $14,152 is earmarked for 15 airport improvements, particularly in [[Cancún International Airport|Cancun]] and [[Mérida International Airport|Merida]].

====New airport for Mexico City====
{{See also|Mexico City Santa Lucía Airport|Mexico City Texcoco Airport}}
During the 2018 campaign for president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador opposed the construction of the [[Mexico City Texcoco Airport|Mexico City Texcoco Airport (NAIM)]], the principal infrastructure project of President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]]. AMLO complained about costs, corruption, and environmental concerns such as unstable soil on the bed of [[Lake Texcoco]]. He said it would be better to convert the military base of Santa Lucia in [[Zumpango]], State of Mexico, to civilian use.<ref>{{cite web |website=Expansión Politica|title=AMLO y el Nuevo Aeropuerto viven una relación turbulenta|date=April 4, 2018|accessdate=Jan 23, 2020|language=es|trans-title=AMLO and the New Airport live a turbulent relationship |url=https://politica.expansion.mx/presidencia/2018/04/04/amlo-y-el-nuevo-aeropuerto-viven-una-relacion-turbulenta}}</ref>

Ending the Texcoco project was highly controversial so after winning the election Lopez Obrador decided to submit the proposal to the people of Mexico.

López Obrador defined the first three transformations as the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810-1821), the [[Reform War]] (1858-1861) and the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1917).<ref name=\"que\">{{cite web|website=BBC News Mundo|title=AMLO presidente: ¿qué es la \"Cuarta Transformación\" que propone Andrés Manuel López Obrador para México?|date=Nov 26, 2018|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020|language=es|trans-title=AMLO president: What is the \"Fourth Transformation\" proposed by Andrés Manuel López Obrador for Mexico?|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-45712329}}</ref>

The ''privileged abuses'' Lopez Obrador refers to have to do with high salaries and the luxurious enjoyed by high government officials in a country where half the population lives in poverty. AMLO wants to lower salaries for not only the [[President of Mexico|president]] but also [[Cabinet of Mexico|Cabinet]] members and high-level bureaucrats, justices of the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court (SCJN)]], [[Congress of the Union|legislators]], and members of independent agencies such as the [[Instituto Nacional Electoral|electoral commission (INE)]] and the [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography|census office (INEGI)]]. In addition to salaries, AMLO mentions luxury vehicles including airplanes and helicopters; expensive private health insurance in addition to the [[Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers|program for government officials (ISSSTE)]]; expense accounts for bodyguards, gasoline, cell phones, and food; and a lack of transparency.<ref name=\"abusivos\">{{cite web|website=BBC News Mundo|title=México: los \"abusivos\" privilegios en el gobierno que AMLO quiere eliminar con su plan de austeridad|author=Alberto Nájar|date=July 25, 2018|language=es|trans-title= Mexico: the \"abusive\" privileges in the government that AMLO wants to eliminate with its austerity plan|url= https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-44949439}}</ref>

==Defining the Fourth Transformation==
{{See also|Desafuero of Andrés Manuel López Obrador}}
{{quote|\"Based on what we have achieved, we will seek to undertake a peaceful and orderly transformation, yes, but no less profound than Independence, the Reformation, and the Revolution; we have not made all this effort for mere cosmetic changes, by far, and much less to stay with more of the same.\" — Andrés Manuel López Obrador<ref name=\"cuarta\">{{cite web |website=Nación 321 |title=¿Qué es la cuarta transformación de México que presume AMLO?|date=Dec 1, 2018|language=es|trans-title= What is the fourth transformation of Mexico that AMLO presumes?|url= https://www.nacion321.com/elecciones/que-es-la-cuarta-transformacion-de-mexico-que-presume-amlo}}</ref>}}

In a speech given at the end of his [[2018 Mexican general election|campaign for president]], Lopez Obrador spelled out what he means by the Fourth Transformation. He called for a nation of laws wherein nothing is outside the law and no one is above the law. He said the security services would be reformed so that no one was spied upon and religion, ideas, and the right to descent would be respected. AMLO called for a true democracy guaranteeing free elections and prison for electoral fraud. He called for an end of corruption and said the law should apply not only to government officials but also to their families. He said he would reform the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]] so that even the [[Desafuero of Andrés Manuel López Obrador|president could be prosecuted]] for corruption. He called for a [[popular consultation]] process after three years to determine whether the president should be recalled. He insisted that luxuries, such as high salaries for government officials, the presidential airplane and [[Los Pinos|official residence]], bodyguards, and presidential pensions should be cut or eliminated.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/>

AMLO also called for increased attention to the needs of rural communities, revitalization of the construction industry, improvements in the energy sector, pensions for elderly Mexicans, free medicine, and improved education with access for all.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/>

''[[Forbes|Forbes Mexico]],'' in a September 2018 article said that the Fourth Transformation presents an opportunity for Mexico to move forward as a true democracy. It could not depend on one political party and must move beyond campaign slogans. The authors, Nicola Morfini and Bernardo Sainz Martínez of the [[Instituto Panamericano de Alta Dirección de Empresa|Pan American Institute for High Business Management (IPADE)]], argue that Mexico is at a crossroads: the large margin of victory by ''[[Juntos Haremos Historia]]'' in the 2018 election makes true change possible while also highlighting the possibility of regression. They warn that if decision-making depends exclusively on [[National Regeneration Movement|National Regeneration Movement (Morena)]], the legislature could lose power as it did under the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)]]. Given the high poverty levels in the country, the authors suggest that popular democracy may be easily manipulated. They point out that many members of Morena were once members of PRI, which should have a moderating effect on political changes. Finally, they conclude that the future of Mexico depends on everyone.<ref>{{cite web|website=Forbes México|title=López Obrador hacia la cuarta transformación|author1= Nicola Morfini|author2= Bernardo Sainz Martínez|date=Sep 19, 2018|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020|language=es|trans-title= López Obrador towards the fourth transformation|url= https://www.forbes.com.mx/lopez-obrador-hacia-la-cuarta-transformacion/}}</ref>

==The first three transformations==
President Lopez Obrador cites three previous periods of transformation in [[history of Mexico]]: the Independence Movement (1810-1821), ''La Reforma'' (1858-1861), and the Mexican Revolution (1910-1917). While all three events involved extreme violence, AMLO insists that the fourth transformation be peaceful.<ref name=\"que\"/><ref name=\"cuarta\"/>

===The War of Independence===
After nearly 300 years of Spanish colonization, on the morning of September 16, 1810, Catholic priest [[Miguel Hidalgo]] called the people of [[Cry of Dolores|Dolores Hidalgo]] to take up arms against their Spanish overlords. Hidalgo took up a banner of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgin of Guadalupe]]<ref name=\"natgo\">{{cite web|website=National Geographic Culture |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2018/09/mexico-independence-day-confusion-cinco-de-mayo/|title=Mexico Independence Day: What You Need to Know|author=Heather Brady|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref> After a few battles, Hidalgo had gathered a ragtime, disorganized army of 80,000. Hidalgo's army was eventually defeated, and Hidalgo was defrocked and beheaded. His chief collaborator, [[Ignacio Allende]] was also captured and beheaded.<ref>{{cite web|website=Mexican History.com|url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Independence.htm|title= The war for Independence 1810-1821|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref>

Hidalgo's disciple, Father [[José María Morelos]] took up the struggle, winning 22 battles in nine months. Morelos convened the [[Congress of Chilpancingo]], which declared independence, abolished slavery and the [[caste]] system, and declared Catholicism the state religion. However, Morelos soon was defeated, caught, and executed.<ref name=\"jose\">{{cite web|website=Mexican History.com|title=The Independence movement after the death of Miguel Hidalgo |url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Independence.htm#jose}}</ref>

For five years, the insurgents were confined mostly to guerrilla warfare, led by [[Guadalupe Victoria]] near Puebla and [[Vicente Guerrero]] in the mountains of Oaxaca. By 1819, the Spanish viceroy, [[Juan Ruiz de Apodaca, 1st Count of Venadito|Juan Ruiz de Apodaca]] was able to report that the situation was under control.<ref name=\"jose\"/>
 
Events in Spain led to a weakening of the crown, With Guerrero, he wrote the [[Plan of Iguala]]. Iturbide, Guerrero, and Victoria marched on Mexico City; on September 27, 1821, they defeated the Spanish and Mexico consolidated its independence.<ref name=\"jose\"/>

Iturbide became [[First Mexican Empire|emperor]] of the new nation, but three years later he was deposed and a [[History of Mexico|republic]] was established with Guadalupe Victoria as its [[List of heads of state of Mexico|first president]].<ref name=\"natgo\"/>

===La Reforma===
{{Main|Reform War}}
''La Reforma'' (the Reform) was a liberal movement led by [[Benito Juárez]] in 1857 to disestablish the power of the [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Catholic Church]]; establish [[separation of Church and State]]; reduce the power of the military; and establish civil registry of births, marriages, and deaths.<ref name=\"cuarta\"/> Conservatives fought back, leading to the [[War of Reform]] (1858-1861).<ref>{{cite web|website=Global Security.org |title=1858-1861 - War of the Reform|accessdate=Jan 22, 2020 |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/mexican-reform.htm}}</ref> The liberals won the war, but the war left the country weak, and it was soon followed by the [[Second French Intervention in Mexico|French intervention]], and the establishment of the [[Second Mexican Empire]] with [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] of Austria as emperor (1864-1867). Juarez and the liberals retook power in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|website=National Geographic History Magazine |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/magazine/2018/05-06/cinco-de-mayo-history-battle-of-puebla/|title=The Victorious origins of Cinco de Mayo|author=Isabel Bueno |accessdate=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref>

===The Mexican Revolution===
{{Main|Mexican Revolution}}
After an unsuccessful electoral campaign against President and dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]], on November 20, [[1910 in Mexico|1910]], [[Francisco I. Madero]] called the Mexican people to arms. In 30 years of rule, Diaz had modernized the country and established a growing economy, but he had done so by granting numerous concessions to British and American investors while denying basic liberties to peasant farmers, miners, and workers. In a bad year, such as 1908–1909, the peasants were reduced to virtual slavery. Within six months of Madero's call to arms, Diaz had resigned and the moderate, middle-class Madero became president.<ref name=\"today\">{{cite web|website=History Today.com|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/mexican-revolution|title=The Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910, was one of the great revolutionary upheavals of the twentieth century.|author=Alan Knight|date=May 5, 1980 |volume=30|issue=5|accessdate=Jan 23, 2020}}</ref>
 
Madero's moderate reforms were not satisfactory to peasant leaders such as [[Poncho Villa]] in the north and [[Emiliano Zapata]] in the south. Fighting continued, and full warfare broke out. Madero was overthrown by the army and assassinated in early 1913 by [[Victoriano Huerta]], who after thirteen months of harsh rule and fierce fighting was overthrown and executed.<ref name=\"today\"/> There were numerous small bands led by local warlords; eventually, many of them gave up while others united under [[Venustiano Carranza]]. Carranza was able to consolidate his power, and on February 5, 1917, he published the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1917]], which many see as the end of the Mexican Revolution. However, fighting continued well into the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web |website=PBS History Detectives|title=Mexican Revolution|accessdate=Jan 23, 2020 |url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/mexican-revolution/}}</ref>

==Successes and failures==
A year after the election and seven months since he took office, President [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador|López Obrador]] stated that he had fulfilled 78 of the 100 promises he had made, including ending the [[Mexican Drug War|Drug War]]. He also said that the state has stopped being the principal [[Human rights in Mexico|human rights]] violator. He promised to end corruption and admitted that there is still a lot of work to do in questions of the economy, health, and public safety.<ref>{{cite web |website=Informador.mx|title=Afirma AMLO cumplir 78 de 100 compromisos|url=https://www.informador.mx/Afirma-AMLO-cumplir-78-de-100-compromisos-l201907020001.html|date=July 2, 2019|language=es|trans-title=AMLO affirms fulfilling 78 of 100 commitments}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===
President Lopez Obrador announced an MXN $859 billion (US$44 billion) investment plan for 147 infrastructure projects in November 2019. The investments are in highways, railways, ports, and airports as well as investments in telecommunications with most of the capital coming from the private sector. \"This is of the highest importance,\" said Lopez Obrador. \"Participation of the private sector in the country’s growth is necessary.\"<ref>{{cite web|website=Bloomberg|title=Mexico Unveils $44 Billion Infrastructure Plan to Boost GDP|author1=Andrea Navarro|author2=Justin Villamil|date=26 Nov 2019 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-26/mexico-unveils-44-billion-infrastructure-plan-to-boost-economy}} {{cite web|website=Reuters Business News|title=Mexico to spend $44 billion on infrastructure in first phase of plan|author=Sharay Angulo|date=Nov 26, 2019|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-infrastructure/mexico-to-spend-44-billion-on-infrastructure-in-first-phase-of-plan-idUSKBN1Y01UQ}}</ref>

Priority energy projects are the [[Petroleum coke|coking plant]] in [[Tula de Allende|Tula, Hidalgo]] (MXN $40 billion), the refinery in [[Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León|Cadereyta, Nuevo León]] (MXN $17 billion), and the Pemex Gas Processing Complex to the Mayakán pipeline in [[Macuspana Municipality|Macuspana, Tabasco]] (MXN $1 billion).

====New airport for Mexico City====
{{See also|Mexico City Santa Lucía Airport|Mexico City Texcoco Airport}}
During the 2018 campaign for president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador opposed the construction of the [[Mexico City Texcoco Airport|Mexico City Texcoco Airport (NAIM)]], the principal infrastructure project of President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]]. AMLO complained about costs, corruption, and environmental concerns such as unstable soil on the bed of [[Lake Texcoco]]. He said it would be better to convert the military base of Santa Lucia in [[Zumpango]], State of Mexico, to civilian use.<ref>{{cite web |website=Expansión Politica|title=AMLO y el Nuevo Aeropuerto viven una relación turbulenta|date=April 4, 2018|accessdate=Jan 23, 2020|language=es|trans-title=AMLO and the New Airport live a turbulent relationship |url=https://politica.expansion.mx/presidencia/2018/04/04/amlo-y-el-nuevo-aeropuerto-viven-una-relacion-turbulenta}}</ref>

==Timeline==
{{2019–20 coronavirus pandemic data/Hong Kong medical cases chart}}

===January===
Upon learning of the outbreak, the government required disclosure of those who had been to wet markets in Wuhan. The government widened the criteria for notification on 3 January – anyone who had visited Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of any respiratory symptoms of illness would need to inform health authorities.<ref name=scmp3044654/>

The HK government declared a \"serious response level\" to the virus outbreak centred on Wuhan on 4 January, when Hong Kong announced eight suspected cases; the eight cases turned out negative for the disease from Wuhan. Medical experts in Hong Kong urged mainland authorities to be more forthcoming with Wuhan patient information that could aid epidemiological study.<ref name=scmp3044654/> Although Wuhan health authorities said there was “no obvious evidence” of human-to-human transmission of the then-unidentified virus, University of Hong Kong infectious diseases expert Dr Ho Pak-leung suspected such transmission had happened among cases in Wuhan, and urged “the most stringent” precautionary measures.<ref name=scmp3044654>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3044654/hong-kong-activates-serious-response-level |title=Hong Kong activates ‘serious response level’ for infectious diseases as Wuhan pneumonia outbreak escalates &#124; South China Morning Post |publisher=Scmp.com |date= |accessdate=2020-04-08}}</ref> However, press reported that border checkpoint at the high-speed rail terminal were lax at that point in time.<ref name=scmp3044706>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3044706/china-pneumonia-hong-kong-authorities-take-low |title=China pneumonia: Hong Kong authorities take low-key approach to passengers arriving in Hong Kong on Wuhan trains &#124; South China Morning Post |publisher=Scmp.com |date=2020-01-22 |accessdate=2020-04-08}}</ref>

On 29 January, two connected cases had been confirmed by health officials, raising the number of confirmed cases to 10. The 9th and 10th cases consisted of a couple from Wuhan, China in their 70s who had arrived in Hong Kong on board Cathay Dragon KA853 on January 22, and checked into the W Hotel in West Kowloon on the same day. They had visited multiple restaurants at the hotel and the Elements mall; they also visited the Ritz Carlton and also Four Seasons Hotel on 28 January. During their visit to Four Seasons Hotel, the staff had sensed that both visitors had high temperatures and a consistent cough. Therefore, the staff called an ambulance for help and both of them were transferred to Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong Island. After testing twice, the results showed that both of them had contracted the coronavirus. The [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]] (LCSD) announced that all facilities overseen by the department including all public museums, public libraries and sports centres and venues will be closed until further notice as a health precaution.<ref name=20200128lcsd>{{cite web|url=https://www.lcsd.gov.hk/clpss/en/webApp/NewsDetails.do?id=14683|title=Temporary closure of LCSD facilities from tomorrow|date=28 January 2020|website=[[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]] |access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref> On 14 February, the LCSD announced that the closure of its facilities will extended until 2 March 2020.<ref name=20200214lcsd>{{cite web|url=https://www.lcsd.gov.hk/clpss/en/webApp/NewsDetails.do?id=14703|title=Latest arrangements on LCSD public services|date=14 February 2020|website=[[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]] |access-date=14 February 2020}}</ref>

On 30 January, two individual cases of coronavirus had been confirmed, raising the count to 12. The 11th case was a 39-year-old woman who lived and worked in Hong Kong, also the daughter of the 9th and 10th (Husband and Wife from Wuhan) cases. She had previously also stayed with them at the W Hotel in West Kowloon, and also visited the places they went in Hong Kong. She had developed symptoms on 28 January, after sending her parents to hospital. After learning that her parents had contracted COVID-19, she visited the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and was confirmed to have the virus after tests on 30 January. This was the first case in Hong Kong of which the patient did not visit Wuhan/Mainland China during the previous month. The 12th patient was a 75-year-old man who lived in Tsing Yi, Kowloon. He had visited the Guangdong province in China during late December till early January. He had also visited Macau for several days in mid-January. He developed coughing symptoms on January 22 and was hospitalised in a regular hospital room at the Queen Margaret Hospital, he was not tested as he did not inform the doctors that he had been to Macau and Mainland China in the previous month. On January 30, his conditions worsened and he was tested for the coronavirus, and the result came out positive.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

On 31 January, one case of COVID-19 had been confirmed. The patient was a Hong Kong 39-year-old (13th case) with diabetes, who lived in Whampoa, Kowloon. He had came back from Wuhan in the previous week, and developed muscle pain on 29 January. He developed a cough and fever on 31 January, and was confirmed to have the coronavirus. Afterwards, his family were transferred to a quarantine camp.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

On 25 March, Hong Kong closed its border to all incoming nonresidents arriving from overseas. Transiting through Hong Kong is no longer allowed either. All returning residents, regardless of point of departure, are subject to the Compulsory Quarantine Order, which requires all to stay at a reported quarantine premise (either home or hotel) for 14 days. Tracking devices are employed to enforce the order. All returning residents from the United States, the UK, and continental Europe are required to go through enhanced screening and submit saliva sample for COVID-19 testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202003/24/P2020032400050.htm|title=

===April===
On 1 April, the Hong Kong government announced the temporary closure of karaoke lounges, nightclubs and mahjong premises. Confusion over the government's listing of venues to be temporarily closed led the public to believe that other venues such as beauty parlors, massage parlors and clubhouses would have to be closed as well. However the government clarified that such establishments would be allowed to remain open subject to businesses providing hand sanitizer to customers, as well as requiring customers to wear a mask and have their temperature taken while inside the business venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1518212-20200401.htm?|title=Karaokes, clubs, mahjong parlours ordered to close - RTHK|website=news.rthk.hk}}</ref>

On Friday 3 April at 1800 hrs, all pubs and bars across the territory were ordered to close for 14 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/04/20200402/20200402_195740_071.html|title=Restrictions on bars gazetted - Govt News|website=news.gov.hk}}</ref>

== Border closure controversy ==
The Hong Kong Government resisted public pressure to close all the borders with the mainland, opting instead for partial closures to reduce the risk of the virus entering Hong Kong. There were calls for tightening up controls and checks for visitors, especially those coming from Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic.<ref name=scmp3047660>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3047660/china-coronavirus-hong-kong-leader-adopts-advice-medical</ref> Medical experts had demanded mandatory health declarations at all borders and ports but they were initially rejected. Chief Executive of Hong Kong [[Carrie Lam]] rejected proposals to close borders as “inappropriate and impractical”, but said that mandatory declarations would be implemented.<ref name=scmp3047660/>

On 28 January, Lam announced that the high-speed rail link with mainland China, and all cross-border ferry services, would be suspended starting two days later.<ref name=theguardian133247383/> Additionally, the number of flights from mainland China and cross-border bus services were reduced. Hong Kong government employees (except those providing essential/emergency services) were asked to work from home. Later on that day, the government closed two border checkpoints.<ref name=scmp3047907>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3047907/china-coronavirus-hong-kong-government-deny-entry|title=Railway closures, no visas: Hong Kong scrambles to fight mainland virus outbreak|date=28 January 2020|website=South China Morning Post|access-date=28 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128091009/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3047907/china-coronavirus-hong-kong-government-deny-entry|archive-date=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> 

As the major border checkpoints such as Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Huanggang remained open, public sector health workers, as represented by Hospital Authority Employees’ Alliance – a newly formed union – decried the government measures as \"too little, too late\".<ref name=scmp3047963>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3047963/hong-kongs-partial-border-closure-amid-wuhan-coronavirus</ref> Over 400 public hospital doctors and nurses also wrote to the government, demanding border closure and also threatening strike action.<ref name=scmp3048457>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3048457/coronavirus-thousands-public-hospital-staff-vote</ref> The union warned the government its members may go on strike in early February if the government failed to implement tighter controls on immigration.<ref name=scmp3047963/>

Facing continued pressure from strikers and from all parties across the political divide, Lam announced a raft of measures including six further border closures on 30 January. Lam explained her government's insistence on keeping major border crossings open conformed with the WHO’s position that draconian travel and trade restrictions were unnecessary, and it was opposed to any \"discriminatory move\" to close borders with China or restrict access to Chinese travellers.<ref name=scmp3048419>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3048419/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-urges-local-residents-not</ref> On 3 February, the government closed all but four border crossings – the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, Shenzhen Bay Port, the international airport, and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal – and introduced further quarantine measures, but still refused closing the border with China.<ref name=scmp3049111/> Pundits noted that Lam lacked the political capital to make the demand for full border closure from the Chinese government.<ref name=scmp3049111/> After a union vote, three days of public hospital strikes ensued.<ref name=scmp3049111>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3049111/coronavirus-why-wont-carrie-lam-shut-hong-kongs-border</ref>

On the professional level, the Hospital Authority reported at the end of January that stock of surgical masks for public hospitals had fallen below three-months' supply, but said it hoped to secure replenishment lasting until June. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she had written to the State Council hoping to obtain supplies from mainland China.<ref name=scmp3048176/>  The [[Government of Hong Kong]] had its imports of face masks cancelled as global face mask stockpiles decline.<ref name=\"scmp3048332\">{{cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3048332/china-coronavirus-hongkongers-online-orders-masks |title=Mask orders cancelled as Hongkongers face overseas supply issues amid virus |date=31 January 2020 |website=South China Morning Post |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131031715/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3048332/china-coronavirus-hongkongers-online-orders-masks |archive-date=31 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> As 80 per cent of surgical masks sold in Hong Kong were mainland-sourced, the considerable internal demand for masks rendered Hong Kong a lower priority.<ref name=\"scmp3048097\"/>

In early February, after CSI masks appeared in the local marketplace, the government was called to account for the supplies of masks manufactured by inmates in local prisons under the aegis of the Correctional Services Industries. In 2019, masks were produced at a rate of 4 million in each quarter by the Correctional Services Department, and were distributed among various government departments. Media reported that the stocks within different departments were freely available to staff before the lunar new year. Due to the onset of the epidemic, they suddenly became a precious commodity in Hong Kong, and the abuse was highlighted.<ref name=scmp3049900>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3049900/hong-kongs-public-investigating-authorities-under</ref>

Following an admission that the city had failed to procure adequate supplies of PPE, the government announced support for local private mask production by subsidising each production line with grants, help in identifying suitable premises, as well as placing orders to sustain their operations.<ref name=scmp3050813/> An increase in mask production by Correctional Services Inndustries from 1.8 million to 2.5 million units a month is planned.<ref name=scmp3050813>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3050813/coronavirus-mask-production-lines-could-be</ref>

==Prevention==
Hong Kong recommended wearing a [[surgical mask]] when taking public transport or staying in crowded places.<ref name=\"1NKsl\">{{cite web |url=https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/prevention_of_covid_19_en.pdf |title=Prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) |website=[[Centre for Health Protection]] |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>

Hong Kong was relatively unscathed the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak and had a flatter epidemic curve than most other places, which observers consider remarkable given its status as an international transport hub. Furthermore, its closeness to mainland China and its millions of mainland visitors annually would make it vulnerable.<ref name=scmp3078437/> Experts now believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 has helped keep its casualty numbers down to 845, with four deaths the beginning of April.<ref name=scmp3078437>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3078437/mask-or-not-mask-who-makes-u-turn-while-us</ref>

===January===
Upon learning of the outbreak, the government required disclosure of those who had been to wet markets in Wuhan. The government widened the criteria for notification on 3 January – anyone who had visited Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of any respiratory symptoms of illness would need to inform health authorities.<ref name=scmp3044654/>

The HK government declared a \"serious response level\" to the virus outbreak centred on Wuhan on 4 January, when Hong Kong announced eight suspected cases; the eight cases turned out negative for the disease from Wuhan. Medical experts in Hong Kong urged mainland authorities to be more forthcoming with Wuhan patient information that could aid epidemiological study.<ref name=scmp3044654/> Although Wuhan health authorities said there was “no obvious evidence” of human-to-human transmission of the then-unidentified virus, University of Hong Kong infectious diseases expert Dr Ho Pak-leung suspected such transmission had happened among cases in Wuhan, and urged “the most stringent” precautionary measures.<ref name=scmp3044654>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3044654/hong-kong-activates-serious-response-level |title=Hong Kong activates ‘serious response level’ for infectious diseases as Wuhan pneumonia outbreak escalates &#124; South China Morning Post |publisher=Scmp.com |date= |accessdate=2020-04-08}}</ref> However, press reported that border checkpoint at the high-speed rail terminal were lax at that point in time.<ref name=scmp3044706>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3044706/china-pneumonia-hong-kong-authorities-take-low |title=China pneumonia: Hong Kong authorities take low-key approach to passengers arriving in Hong Kong on Wuhan trains &#124; South China Morning Post |publisher=Scmp.com |date=2020-01-22 |accessdate=2020-04-08}}</ref>

During their visit to Four Seasons Hotel, the staff had sensed that both visitors had high temperatures and a consistent cough. Therefore, the staff called an ambulance for help and both of them were transferred to Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong Island.

===April===
On 1 April, the Hong Kong government announced the temporary closure of karaoke lounges, nightclubs and mahjong premises. Confusion over the government's listing of venues to be temporarily closed led the public to believe that other venues such as beauty parlors, massage parlors and clubhouses would have to be closed as well. However the government clarified that such establishments would be allowed to remain open subject to businesses providing hand sanitizer to customers, as well as requiring customers to wear a mask and have their temperature taken while inside the business venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1518212-20200401.htm?|title=Karaokes, clubs, mahjong parlours ordered to close - RTHK|website=news.rthk.hk}}</ref>

== Border closure controversy ==
The Hong Kong Government resisted public pressure to close all the borders with the mainland, opting instead for partial closures to reduce the risk of the virus entering Hong there were calls for tightening up controls and checks for visitors, especially those coming from Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic.<ref name=scmp3047660>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3047660/china-coronavirus-hong-kong-leader-adopts-advice-medical</ref> Medical experts had demanded mandatory health declarations at all borders and ports but they were initially rejected. Chief Executive of Hong Kong [[Carrie Lam]] rejected proposals to close borders as “inappropriate and impractical”, but said that mandatory declarations would be implemented.<ref name=scmp3047660/>

On 28 January, Lam announced that the high-speed rail link with mainland China, and all cross-border ferry services, would be suspended starting two days later.<ref name=theguardian133247383/> Additionally, the number of flights from mainland China and cross-border bus services were reduced. Hong Kong government employees (except those providing essential/emergency services) were asked to work from home. Later on that day, the government closed two border checkpoints.<ref name=scmp3047907>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3047907/china-coronavirus-hong-kong-government-deny-entry|title=Railway closures, no visas: Hong Kong scrambles to fight mainland virus outbreak|date=28 January 2020|website=South China Morning Post|access-date=28 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128091009/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3047907/china-coronavirus-hong-kong-government-deny-entry|archive-date=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> 

As the major border checkpoints such as Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Huanggang remained open, public sector health workers, as represented by Hospital Authority Employees’ Alliance – a newly formed union – decried the government measures as \"too little, too late\".<ref name=scmp3047963>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3047963/hong-kongs-partial-border-closure-amid-wuhan-coronavirus</ref> Over 400 public hospital doctors and nurses also wrote to the government, demanding border closure and also threatening strike action.<ref name=scmp3048457>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3048457/coronavirus-thousands-public-hospital-staff-vote</ref> The union warned the government its members may go on strike in early February if the government failed to implement tighter controls on immigration.<ref name=scmp3047963/>

Facing continued pressure from strikers and from all parties across the political divide, Lam announced a raft of measures including six further border closures on 30 January. Lam explained her government's insistence on keeping major border crossings open conformed with the WHO’s position that draconian travel and trade restrictions were unnecessary, and it was opposed to any \"discriminatory move\" to close borders with China or restrict access to Chinese travellers.<ref name=scmp3048419>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3048419/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-urges-local-residents-not</ref> On 3 February, the government closed all but four border crossings – the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, Shenzhen Bay Port, the international airport, and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal – and further quarantine measures, but still refused closing the border with China.<ref name=scmp3049111/> Pundits noted that Lam lacked the political capital to make the demand for full border closure from the Chinese government.<ref name=scmp3049111/> After a union vote, three days of public hospital strikes ensued.<ref name=scmp3049111>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3049111/coronavirus-why-wont-carrie-lam-shut-hong-kongs-border</ref>

On the professional level, the Hospital Authority reported at the end of January that stock of surgical masks for public hospitals had fallen below three-months' supply, but said it hoped to secure replenishment lasting until June.

In early February, after CSI masks appeared in the local marketplace, the government was called to account for the supplies of masks manufactured by inmates in local prisons under the aegis of the Correctional Services Industries. In 2019, masks were produced at a rate of 4 million in each quarter by the Correctional Services Department, and were distributed among various government departments. Media reported that the stocks within different departments were freely available to staff before the lunar new year. Due to the onset of the epidemic, they suddenly became a precious commodity in Hong Kong, and the abuse was highlighted.<ref name=scmp3049900>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3049900/hong-kongs-public-investigating-authorities-under</ref>

Following an admission that the city had failed to procure adequate supplies of PPE, the government announced support for local private mask production by subsidising each production line with grants, help in identifying suitable premises, as well as placing orders to sustain their operations.<ref name=scmp3050813/> An increase in mask production by Correctional Services Inndustries from 1.8 million to 2.5 million units a month is planned.<ref name=scmp3050813>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3050813/coronavirus-mask-production-lines-could-be</ref>

==Prevention==
Hong Kong recommended wearing a [[surgical mask]] when taking public transport or staying in crowded places.<ref name=\"1NKsl\">{{cite web |url=https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/prevention_of_covid_19_en.pdf |title=Prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) |website=[[Centre for Health Protection]] |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>

Hong Kong was relatively unscathed the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak and had a flatter epidemic curve than most other places, which observers consider remarkable given its status as an international transport hub. Furthermore, its closeness to mainland China and its millions of mainland visitors annually would make it vulnerable.<ref name=scmp3078437/> Experts now believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 has helped keep its casualty numbers down to 845, with four deaths the beginning of April.<ref name=scmp3078437>https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3078437/mask-or-not-mask-who-makes-u-turn-while-us</ref>

===Draw and format===
The draw of the EHF Cup group stage took place on Thursday, 1 December 2016. The 16 teams allocated into four pots were drawn into four groups of four teams. The country protection rule was applied, i.e. two clubs from the same country could not face each other in the same group.<ref name=\"GS draw\">{{cite news|title=Göppingen in the group with Midtjylland, Granollers and Porto|url=http://europeancup.eurohandball.com/ehfc/men/2016-17/article/26981/G%C3%B6ppingen+in+the+group+with+Midtjylland%2C+Granollers+and+Porto|accessdate=2 December 2016|publisher=European Handball Federation|date=1 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202170131/http://europeancup.eurohandball.com/ehfc/men/2016-17/article/26981/G%C3%B6ppingen+in+the+group+with+Midtjylland%2C+Granollers+and+Porto|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin format]]. The matchdays are 11–12 February, 17–19 February, 4–5 March, 11–12 March, 25–26 March, and 1–2 April 2017.

If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings (in descending order):
#number of points in matches of all teams directly involved;
#goal difference in matches of all teams directly involved;
#higher number of plus goals in matches of all teams directly involved;
#goal difference in all matches of the group;
#higher number of plus goals in all matches of the group;

If no ranking can be determined, a decision shall be obtained by drawing lots. Lots shall be drawn by the EHF, if possible in the presence of a responsible of each club.

===Draw and format===
The draw of the EHF Cup group stage took place on Thursday, 1 December 2016. The 16 teams allocated into four pots were drawn into four groups of four teams. The country protection rule was applied, i.e. two clubs from the same country could not face each other in the same group.<ref name=\"GS draw\">{{cite news|title=Göppingen in the group with Midtjylland, Granollers and Porto|url=http://europeancup.eurohandball.com/ehfc/men/2016-17/article/26981/G%C3%B6ppingen+in+the+group+with+Midtjylland%2C+Granollers+and+Porto|accessdate=2 December 2016|publisher=European Handball Federation|date=1 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202170131/http://europeancup.eurohandball.com/ehfc/men/2016-17/article/26981/G%C3%B6ppingen+in+the+group+with+Midtjylland%2C+Granollers+and+Porto|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin format]]. The matchdays are 11–12 February, 17–19 February, 4–5 March, 11–12 March, 25–26 March, and 1–2 April 2017.

If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings (in descending order):
#number of points in matches of all teams directly involved;
#goal difference in matches of all teams directly involved;
#higher number of plus goals in matches of all teams directly involved;
#goal difference in all matches of the group;
#higher number of plus goals in all matches of the group;

If no ranking can be determined, a decision shall be obtained by drawing lots. Lots shall be drawn by the EHF, if possible in the presence of a responsible of each club.

== Career ==

=== Radio ===
Atkinson starred in a series of comedy shows for [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1979 called ''[[The Atkinson People]]''. It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and [[Richard Curtis]], and produced by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].<ref name=\"Atkinson people\">\"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/31/tvandradio Pick of the Day]\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2007.</ref>

=== Television ===
After university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for [[London Weekend Television]] in 1979 called [[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|''Canned Laughter'']]. Atkinson then went on to do [[Not the Nine O'Clock News|''Not the Nine O'Clock News'']] for the [[BBC]], produced by his friend [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. He featured in the show with [[Pamela Stephenson]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Mel Smith]], and was one of the main sketch writers.

The success of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' led to him taking the lead role of [[Edmund Blackadder]] in ''[[Blackadder]]''. The first series [[The Black Adder|''The Black Adder'']] (1983), set in the medieval period, Atkinson co-wrote with [[Richard Curtis]]. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. [[Blackadder II|''Blackadder II'']] (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the [[Elizabethan era]]. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels [[Blackadder the Third|''Blackadder the Third'']] (1987), set in the [[Regency era]], and [[Blackadder Goes Forth|''Blackadder Goes Forth'']] (1989), set in World War I. The ''Blackadder'' series became one of the most successful of all [[BBC]] situation comedies, spawning television specials including [[Blackadder's Christmas Carol|''Blackadder's Christmas Carol'']] (1988), [[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years|''Blackadder: The Cavalier Years'']] (1988), and later [[Blackadder: Back & Forth|''Blackadder: Back & Forth'']] (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium. The final scene of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" (when Blackadder and his men go \"over the top\" and charge into No-Man's-Land) has been described as \"bold and highly poignant\". Possessing an [[acerbic wit]] and armed with numerous quick put-downs (which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed), in a 2001 [[Channel 4]] poll Edmund Blackadder was ranked third (behind [[Homer Simpson]] from [[The Simpsons|''The Simpsons'']] and [[Basil Fawlty]] from [[Fawlty Towers|''Fawlty Towers'']]) on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]]. During the 2014 [[centennial of the start of World War I]], Conservative Party politician [[Michael Gove]] and war historian [[Max Hastings]] complained about the so-called \"Blackadder version of history\".

Atkinson in 1997, promoting ''Bean''. In 2014, young adults from abroad named Mr. Bean among a group of people they most associated with British culture.

Atkinson's other creation, the hapless [[Mr. Bean|''Mr. Bean'']], first appeared on New Year's Day in 1990 in a half-hour special for [[Thames Television]]. The character of Mr. Bean has been likened to a modern-day [[Buster Keaton]], but Atkinson himself has stated that [[Jacques Tati]]'s character [[Monsieur Hulot]] was the main inspiration.

Several sequels to ''Mr. Bean'' appeared on television until 1995, and the character later appeared in a feature film. [[Bean (film)|''Bean'']] (1997) was directed by Mel Smith, Atkinson's colleague in ''Not the Nine O'Clock News''. A second film, [[Mr. Bean's Holiday|''Mr. Bean's Holiday'']], was released in 2007. Atkinson portrayed Inspector Raymond Fowler in [[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|''The Thin Blue Line'']] (1995–96), a television sitcom written by Ben Elton, which takes place in a police station located in fictitious Gasforth.

Atkinson has fronted campaigns for [[Kronenbourg Brewery|Kronenbourg]], [[Fujifilm]], and [[Blood donation|Give Blood]]. Atkinson appeared as a hapless and error-prone espionage agent named Richard Lathum in a long-running series of adverts for [[Barclaycard]], on which character his title role in [[Johnny English|''Johnny English'']], [[Johnny English Reborn|''Johnny English Reborn'']] and [[Johnny English Strikes Again|''Johnny English Strikes Again'']] was based. In 1999, he played [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in [[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|''The Curse of Fatal Death'']], a special [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] serial produced for the charity telethon [[Comic Relief]]. Atkinson appeared as the ''Star in a Reasonably Priced Car'' on the BBC's [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|''Top Gear'']] in July 2011, driving the [[Kia Cee'd]] around the track in 1:42.2. Placing him at the top of the leaderboard, his lap time was significantly quicker than the previous high-profile record holder [[Tom Cruise]], whose time was a 1:44.2.

Atkinson appeared at the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] in London as Mr. Bean in a comedy sketch during a performance of \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\", playing a repeated single note on [[synthesizer]]. He then lapsed into a dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the [[Chariots of Fire|film of the same name]] (about the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]), beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at St. Andrews, by riding in a [[minicab]] and tripping the front runner. Atkinson starred as [[Jules Maigret]] in [[Maigret (2016 TV series)|''Maigret'']], a series of television films from ITV.

=== Retirement of Mr. Bean Live ===
In November 2012, it emerged that Rowan Atkinson intended to retire Mr. Bean. \"The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me — basically quite physical, quite childish — I increasingly feel I'm going to do a lot less of,\" Atkinson told [[The Daily Telegraph|''The Daily Telegraph'']]'s Review. \"Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their 50s being childlike becomes a little sad. You've got to be careful.\" He has also said that the role [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] him to a degree. Despite these comments, Atkinson said in 2016 that he would never retire the character of Mr. Bean.

In October 2014, Atkinson also appeared as Mr. Bean in a TV advert for [[Snickers]]. In 2015, he starred alongside [[Ben Miller]] and [[Rebecca Front]] in a sketch for BBC [[Red Nose Day]] in which Mr. Bean attends a funeral.

In 2017, he appeared as Mr. Bean in the Chinese film ''Huan Le Xi Ju Ren''. In October 2018, Atkinson (as Mr. Bean) received [[YouTube Play Buttons|YouTube's Diamond Play Button]] for his channel surpassing 10 million subscribers on the video platform. Among the most-watched channels in the world, in 2017 it had more than 4.5 billion views.

=== Animated Mr. Bean ===
In January 2014, ITV announced a new animated series featuring Mr. Bean with Rowan Atkinson returning to the role. It was expected to be released online as a Web-series later in 2014, as a television broadcast followed shortly after.

On 6 February 2018, Regular Capital announced that there would be a Season 5 of the Animated Mr Bean in 2019 (voiced by Atkinson). The first episode, Teddy's King, aired in February 2019.

Following yet another 3-year hiatus, a fifth season consisting of 26 episodes is scheduled to premiere in 2019 on CITV as well as on [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] channels worldwide.

=== Film ===
Atkinson's film career began with a supporting part in the \"unofficial\" [[James Bond]] movie [[Never Say Never Again|''Never Say Never Again'']] (1983) and a leading role in [[Dead on Time (1983 film)|''Dead on Time'']] (also 1983) with [[Nigel Hawthorne]]. He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film [[The Appointments of Dennis Jennings|''The Appointments of Dennis Jennings'']]. He appeared in Mel Smith's directorial debut [[The Tall Guy|''The Tall Guy'']] (1989) and appeared alongside [[Anjelica Huston]] and [[Mai Zetterling]] in [[The Witches (1990 film)|''The Witches'']] (1990), a film adaptation of the [[Roald Dahl]] [[The Witches (novel)|children's novel]]. He played the part of Dexter Hayman in [[Hot Shots! Part Deux|''Hot Shots! Part Deux'']] (1993), a parody of [[Rambo III|''Rambo III'']], starring [[Charlie Sheen]].

Atkinson gained further recognition with his turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in [[Four Weddings and a Funeral|''Four Weddings and a Funeral'']] (1994, written and directed by his long time collaborator [[Richard Curtis]]), and featured in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] [[The Lion King|''The Lion King'']] (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the [[red-billed hornbill]]. He also sang the song “[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]” in ''The Lion King''. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including [[Rat Race (film)|''Rat Race'']] (2001), [[Scooby-Doo (film)|''Scooby-Doo'']] (2002), jewellery salesman Rufus in another Richard Curtis British-set romantic comedy, [[Love Actually|''Love Actually'']] (2003), and the crime comedy [[Keeping Mum|''Keeping Mum'']] (2005), which also starred [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], [[Maggie Smith]], and [[Patrick Swayze]].

In addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with [[Bean (film)|''Bean'']] (1997) to international success. A sequel, [[Mr. Bean's Holiday|''Mr. Bean's Holiday'']] (2007), (again inspired to some extent by Jacques Tati in his film ‘Les Vacances de M. Hulot’), also became an international success. He has also starred in the James Bond parody [[Johnny English (film series)|''Johnny English film series'']] (2003–2018).

=== Theatre ===
Rowan Atkinson performed live on-stage skits — also appearing with members of [[Monty Python]] — in [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|''The Secret Policeman's Ball'']] (1979) in London for [[Amnesty International]]. Atkinson undertook a four-month tour of the UK in 1980. A recording of the stage performance was subsequently released as [[Live in Belfast|''Live in Belfast'']]''.''

In 1984, Atkinson appeared in a [[West End theatre|West End]] version of the comedy play [[The Nerd (play)|''The Nerd'']] alongside a 10-year-old [[Christian Bale]]. ''The Sneeze and Other Stories'', seven short [[Anton Chekhov]] plays, translated and adapted by [[Michael Frayn]], were performed by Rowan Atkinson, [[Timothy West]] and [[Cheryl Campbell]] at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], London in 1988 and early 1989.

''Oliver!'' billboard at the West End's [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 2009.

In 2009, during the West End revival of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]'' based on [[Charles Dickens]]' novel [[Oliver Twist|''Oliver Twist'']], Atkinson played the role of [[Fagin]]. His portrayal and singing of Fagin at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London gained favourable reviews and he was nominated for an [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] for best actor in a musical or entertainment.

On 28 November 2012, Rowan Atkinson reprised the role of Blackadder at the \"We Are Most Amused\" comedy gala for [[The Prince's Trust]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved the first new Blackadder material for 10 years, with Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.

In February 2013, Atkinson took on the titular role in a 12-week production (directed by [[Richard Eyre]]) of the [[Simon Gray]] play [[Quartermaine's Terms|''Quartermaine's Terms'']] at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in London with costars [[Conleth Hill]] ([[Game of Thrones|''Game of Thrones'']]) and [[Felicity Montagu]] ([[I'm Alan Partridge|''I'm Alan Partridge'']]). In December 2013, he revived his schoolmaster sketch for Royal Free Hospital's Rocks with Laughter at the Adelphi Theatre. A few days prior, he performed a selection of sketches in a small coffee venue in front of only 30 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindychannel.com/entertainment/rowan-atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-london_26375720|title=Rowan-Atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-London_26375720|author=(SMH/WNTSU/LR)|work=RTV6|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217104405/http://www.theindychannel.com/entertainment/rowan-atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-london_26375720|archivedate=17 December 2013}}</ref>

== Comic style ==
Best known for his use of [[physical comedy]] in his Mr. Bean persona, Atkinson's other characters rely more on language. Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely [[deadpan]] delivery.

One of his better-known [[comedic device|comic devices]] is over-articulation of the \"B\" sound, such as his pronunciation of \"[[Bob (Blackadder character)|Bob]]\" in the ''[[Blackadder II]]'' episode \"[[Bells (Blackadder)|Bells]]\". Atkinson suffers from a [[Stuttering|stammer]],<ref>{{cite news|title=10 Questions for Rowan Atkinson|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1655712,00.html|access-date=1 June 2011|work=Time|date=23 August 2007}}</ref> and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.

Atkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of [[Buster Keaton]],<ref name=\"Museum.tv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|title=Museum.tv|publisher=Museum.tv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005150240/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|archive-date=5 October 2014|access-date=21 June 2011}}</ref> sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called \"the man with the rubber face\"; comedic reference was made to this in an episode of ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (\"[[Sense and Senility]]\"), in which [[Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) refers to his master, [[Edmund Blackadder|Mr. E. Blackadder]], as a \"lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard\".

==Influences==

Atkinson's early comedy influences were the sketch comedy troupe ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', made up of [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Alan Bennett]], major figures of the 1960s British [[satire boom]], and then [[Monty Python]]. Atkinson states, “I remember watching them avidly as students at university.”<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He continued to be influenced by the work of [[John Cleese]] following his Monty Python days, regarding Cleese as being “a major, major inspiration”, adding, “I think that he and I are quite different in our style and our approach, but certainly it was comedy I liked to watch. He was very physical. Yes, very physical and very angry.”<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He was also influenced by [[Peter Sellers]], whose characters [[Hrundi Bakshi]] from ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'' (1968) and [[Inspector Clouseau]] from ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' films influenced Atkinson's characters Mr. Bean and Johnny English.<ref>{{cite news |title=Want funny?

On [[Barry Humphries]]' [[Dame Edna Everage]], he states, “I loved that character – again, it's the veneer of respectability disguising suburban prejudice of a really quite vicious and dismissive nature.”<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> Of visual comedians, Atkinson regards [[Charlie Chaplin]], Buster Keaton and [[Harold Lloyd]] as influential.<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He was also inspired by French comedian [[Jacques Tati]], stating, “''[[Mr. Hulot's Holiday]]'' I remember seeing when I was 17 – that was a major inspiration. He opened a window to a world that I'd never looked out on before, and I thought, \"God, that's interesting,\" how a comic situation can be developed as purely visual and yet it's not under-cranked, it's not speeded-up, it's more deliberate; it takes its time. And I enjoyed that.”<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{cite news|title = Before and after 'Bean': A talk with Rowan Atkinson, continued| url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-mr-bean-rowan-atkinson-20150326-column.html| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref>

=== Political activism ===
In June 2005, Atkinson led a coalition of the United Kingdom's most prominent actors and writers, including [[Nicholas Hytner]], [[Stephen Fry]], and [[Ian McEwan]], to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in an attempt to force a review of the controversial [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006|Racial and Religious Hatred Bill]], which they felt would give overwhelming power to religious groups to impose censorship on the arts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article535556.ece|title=Rowan Atkinson leads crusade against religious hatred Bill|last=Freeman|first=Simon|date=20 June 2005|work=The Times|location=UK|access-date=22 September 2009}}</ref>
In 2009, he criticized [[Homophobia|homophobic]] speech legislation, saying that the [[House of Lords]] must vote against a government attempt to remove a free speech clause in an anti-gay hate law.<ref>{{cite news|last=Geen|first=Jessica|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-11670.html|title=Rowan Atkinson attacks gay hate law|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|access-date=21 June 2011|date=19 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610223606/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-11670.html|archive-date=10 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Atkinson opposed the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] to outlaw inciting religious hatred, arguing that, \"freedom to criticise ideas — any ideas even if they are sincerely held beliefs — is one of the fundamental freedoms of society. And the law which attempts to say you can criticise or ridicule ideas as long as they are not religious ideas is a very peculiar law indeed.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4073997.stm | title=Atkinson's religious hate worry | work=BBC News | date=7 December 2004 | access-date=9 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1478381/Atkinson-defends-right-to-offend.html | title=Atkinson defends right to offend | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=7 December 2004 | access-date=9 January 2016}}</ref>

In October 2012, he voiced his support for the [[Hate speech laws in the United Kingdom#Reform Section 5 campaign|Reform Section 5 campaign]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9616750/Rowan-Atkinson-we-must-be-allowed-to-insult-each-other.html|title=Rowan Atkinson: we must be allowed to insult each other|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 October 2012|access-date=21 October 2012|location=London}}</ref> which aims to reform or repeal Section 5 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]], particularly its statement that an [[Harassment, alarm or distress|insult]] can be grounds for arrest and punishment.

=== Cars ===
Atkinson holds a category C+E (formerly \"Class 1\") [[Truck|lorry]] [[Driving licence in the United Kingdom|driving licence]], gained in 1981, because lorries held a fascination for him, and to ensure employment as a young actor. He has also used this skill when filming comedy material. In 1991, he starred in the self-penned ''The Driven Man'', a series of sketches featuring Atkinson driving around London trying to solve his obsession with cars, and discussing it with taxi drivers, policemen, used-car salesmen and psychotherapists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=42187|work=The New York Times|title=Rowan Atkinson: The Driven Man&nbsp;— Trailer&nbsp;— Cast&nbsp;— Showtimes|first=Manohla|last=Dargis|date=7 February 2005}}</ref> A lover of and participant in car racing, he appeared as racing driver [[Tim Birkin|Henry Birkin]] in the television play ''Full Throttle'' in 1995.

Atkinson has raced in other cars, including a [[Renault 5 GT Turbo]] for two seasons for its [[Renault Clio Cup|one make series]]. From 1997 to 2015, he owned a rare [[McLaren F1]], which was involved in an accident in Cabus, near [[Garstang]], Lancashire, with an [[Austin Metro]] in October 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/485692.stm|work=BBC News|title=Mr Bean crashes sports car|date=27 October 1999}}</ref> It was damaged again in a serious crash in August 2011 when it caught fire after Atkinson reportedly lost control and hit a tree.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dunning|first=Craig|title=Mr Bean and Blackadder star Rowan Atkinson in hospital after McLaren F1 supercar crash|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 August 2011|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/story-e6freuy9-1226109003161|access-date =5 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/news/cambridgeshire_tv_star_rowan_atkinson_in_hospital_following_crash_1_985153|title= Update: TV star Rowan Atkinson in hospital following Cambridgeshire crash|work= Evening Star}}</ref> That accident caused significant damage to the vehicle, taking over a year to be repaired and leading to the largest insurance payout in Britain, at £910,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Warnes|first=Sophie|title=Rowan Atkinson crash forces insurers to pay out record £910,000 to repair supercar|work=The Independent|date=7 February 2013|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rowan-atkinson-crash-forces-insurers-to-pay-out-record-910000-to-repair-supercar-8486081.html|access-date =26 March 2015|location=London}}</ref> He has previously owned a [[Honda NSX]],<ref name=tgs16>Top Gear Series 17, episode 4</ref> an [[Audi A8]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/the-cars-of-the-stars-rowan-atkinson.aspx |title=The cars of the stars: Rowan Atkinson |publisher=bankrate.com |access-date=30 April 2014}}</ref> a [[Škoda Superb]], and a [[Honda Civic Hybrid]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Wormald |first=Andrew |url=http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147861295 |title=Stars & their Cars: Rowan Atkinson |publisher=MSN |date=31 May 2011 |access-date=21 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918033603/http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147861295 |archivedate=18 September 2009}}</ref>

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician [[Alan Clark]], a devotee of classic motor cars, recorded in his published ''[[Alan Clark Diaries|Diaries]]'' a chance meeting with a man he later realized was Atkinson while driving through [[Oxfordshire]] in May 1984: \"Just after leaving the motorway at Thame I noticed a dark red [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS V8]] Aston Martin on the slip road with the bonnet up, a man unhappily bending over it. I told Jane to pull in and walked back. A DV8 in trouble is always good for a gloat.\" Clark writes that he gave Atkinson a lift in his [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]] to the nearest telephone box, but was disappointed in his bland reaction to being recognised, noting that: \"he didn't sparkle, was rather disappointing and [[wikt:chétif|chétif]].\"<ref>Alan Clark Diaries (Phoenix, 1993) p. 80</ref>

In July 2001, Atkinson crashed an [[Aston Martin V8 Zagato]] at an enthusiasts' meeting, but walked away unhurt. This was while he was competing in the ''[[Aston Martin Owners Club]]'' event, at the [[Croft Circuit|Croft Racing Circuit]], [[Darlington]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Atkinson unharmed after car crash|work=BBC News|date=9 July 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1430754.stm|access-date=27 February 2016}}</ref>

One car Atkinson has said he will not own is a [[Porsche]]: \"I have a problem with Porsches. They're wonderful cars, but I know I could never live with one. Somehow, the typical Porsche people&nbsp;— and I wish them no ill&nbsp;— are not, I feel, my kind of people.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=\"awardref\">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|title=Museum.tv|publisher=Museum.tv|access-date=21 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005150240/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|archive-date=5 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In July 2011, Atkinson appeared as the \"[[Star in a Reasonably Priced Car]]\" on ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', driving the Kia Cee'd around the track in 1:42.2, which at the time granted him first place on the leaderboard, with only [[Matt LeBlanc]] having set a faster time in the Cee'd.<ref name=\"tgs16\" />

=== Honours ===
Atkinson was appointed Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[2013 Birthday Honours]] for services to drama and charity.<ref name=gaz31712>{{London Gazette|issue=60534 |supp=y|page=7|date=15 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22904807 |title=Birthday Honours: Adele joins Blackadder stars on list |work=BBC News |date=14 June 2013 |access-date=8 September 2013}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== Radio ===
Atkinson starred in a series of comedy shows for [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1979 called ''[[The Atkinson People]]''. It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and [[Richard Curtis]], and produced by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].<ref name=\"Atkinson people\">\"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/31/tvandradio Pick of the Day]\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2007.</ref>

=== Television ===
After university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for [[London Weekend Television]] in 1979 called ''[[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|Canned Laughter]]''. Atkinson then went on to do ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' for the [[BBC]], produced by his friend [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. He featured in the show with [[Pamela Stephenson]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Mel Smith]], and was one of the main sketch writers.

The success of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' led to him taking the lead role of [[Edmund Blackadder]] in ''[[Blackadder]]''. The first series ''[[The Black Adder]]'' (1983), set in medieval period, Atkinson co-wrote with [[Richard Curtis]]. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. ''[[Blackadder II]]'' (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the [[Elizabethan era]]. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (1987), set in the [[Regency era]], and ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989), set in World War I. The ''Blackadder'' series became one of the most successful of all [[BBC]] situation comedies, spawning television specials including ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]'' (1988), ''[[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years]]'' (1988), and later ''[[Blackadder: Back & Forth]]'' (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium. The final scene of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" (when Blackadder and his men go \"over the top\" and charge into No-Man's-Land) has been described as \"bold and highly poignant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackaddergoesforth/|title=Blackadder Goes Forth|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Possessing an [[acerbic wit]] and armed with numerous quick put-downs (which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed), in a 2001 [[Channel 4]] poll Edmund Blackadder was ranked third (behind [[Homer Simpson]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and [[Basil Fawlty]] from ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'') on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531160558/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 |title=100 Greatest TV Characters |accessdate=26 May 2019 |publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/ITVProgs/2001/05/05/Y22090001/ |title=100 Greatest ...

Several sequels to ''Mr. Bean'' appeared on television until 1995, and the character later appeared in a feature film. ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'' (1997) was directed by Mel Smith, Atkinson's colleague in ''Not the Nine O'Clock News''. A second film, ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]'', was released in 2007. Atkinson portrayed Inspector Raymond Fowler in ''[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' (1995–96), a television sitcom written by Ben Elton, which takes place in a police station located in fictitious Gasforth.

=== Film ===
Atkinson's film career began with a supporting part in the \"unofficial\" [[James Bond]] movie ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983) and a leading role in ''[[Dead on Time (1983 film)|Dead on Time]]'' (also 1983) with [[Nigel Hawthorne]]. He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film ''[[The Appointments of Dennis Jennings]]''. He appeared in Mel Smith's directorial debut ''[[The Tall Guy]]'' (1989) and appeared alongside [[Anjelica Huston]] and [[Mai Zetterling]] in ''[[The Witches (1990 film)|The Witches]]'' (1990), a film adaptation of the [[Roald Dahl]] [[The Witches (novel)|children's novel]]. He played the part of Dexter Hayman in ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]'' (1993), a parody of ''[[Rambo III]]'', starring [[Charlie Sheen]].

Atkinson gained further recognition with his turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994, written and directed by his long time collaborator [[Richard Curtis]]), and featured in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] ''[[The Lion King]]'' (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the [[red-billed hornbill]]. He also sang the song “[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]” in ''The Lion King''. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]'' (2001), ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' (2002), jewellery salesman Rufus in another Richard Curtis British-set romantic comedy, ''[[Love Actually]]'' (2003), and the crime comedy ''[[Keeping Mum]]'' (2005), which also starred [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], [[Maggie Smith]], and [[Patrick Swayze]].

In addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'' (1997) to international success. A sequel, ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]'' (2007), (again inspired to some extent by Jacques Tati in his film ‘Les Vacances de M. Hulot’), also became an international success. He has also starred in the James Bond parody ''[[Johnny English (film series)|Johnny English film series]]'' (2003–2018).

== Comic style ==
Best known for his use of [[physical comedy]] in his Mr. Bean persona, Atkinson's other characters rely more on language. Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely [[deadpan]] delivery.

One of his better-known [[comedic device|comic devices]] is over-articulation of the \"B\" sound, such as his pronunciation of \"[[Bob (Blackadder character)|Bob]]\" in the ''[[Blackadder II]]'' episode \"[[Bells (Blackadder)|Bells]]\". Atkinson suffers from a [[Stuttering|stammer]],<ref>{{cite news|title=10 Questions for Rowan Atkinson|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1655712,00.html|access-date=1 June 2011|work=Time|date=23 August 2007}}</ref> and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.

Atkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of [[Buster Keaton]],<ref name=\"Museum.tv\" /> sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called \"the man with the rubber face\"; comedic reference was made to this in an episode of ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (\"[[Sense and Senility]]\"), in which [[Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) refers to his master, [[Edmund Blackadder|Mr. E. Blackadder]], as a \"lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard\".

==Influences==

Atkinson's early comedy influences were the sketch comedy troupe ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', made up of [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Alan Bennett]], major figures of the 1960s British [[satire boom]], and then [[Monty Python]]. Atkinson states, “I remember watching them avidly as students at university.”<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He continued to be influenced by the work of [[John Cleese]] following his Monty Python days, regarding Cleese as being “a major, major inspiration”, adding, “I think that he and I are quite different in our style and our approach, but certainly it was comedy I liked to watch. He was very physical. Yes, very physical and very angry.”<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He was also influenced by [[Peter Sellers]], whose characters [[Hrundi Bakshi]] from ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'' (1968) and [[Inspector Clouseau]] from ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' films influenced Atkinson's characters Mr. Bean and Johnny English.<ref>{{cite news |title=Want funny?

On [[Barry Humphries]]' [[Dame Edna Everage]], he states, “I loved that character – again, it's the veneer of respectability disguising suburban prejudice of a really quite vicious and dismissive nature.”<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> Of visual comedians, Atkinson regards [[Charlie Chaplin]], Buster Keaton and [[Harold Lloyd]] as influential.<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He was also inspired by French comedian [[Jacques Tati]], stating, “''[[Mr. Hulot's Holiday]]'' I remember seeing when I was 17 – that was a major inspiration. He opened a window to a world that I'd never looked out on before, and I thought, \"God, that's interesting,\" how a comic situation can be developed as purely visual and yet it's not under-cranked, it's not speeded-up, it's more deliberate; it takes its time. And I enjoyed that.”<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{cite news|title = Before and after 'Bean': A talk with Rowan Atkinson, continued| url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-mr-bean-rowan-atkinson-20150326-column.html| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref>

Rowan Atkinson married Sunetra Sastry in February 1990. They have two children, Ben and Lily.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8683435/Rowan-Atkinson-Mr-Bean-star-known-for-satire-and-love-of-fast-cars.html|title=Rowan Atkinson: Mr Bean star known for satire and love of fast cars|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=30 January 2014|location=London|first=Andrew|last=Hough|date=5 August 2011}}</ref> The couple first met in the late 1980s, when she was working as a makeup artist with the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/beany-wonder/article2275288.ece | title=Beany wonder | work=The Hindu | date=10 June 2007 | access-date=11 November 2015}}</ref> They [[Legal separation|separated]] in 2014 and were [[divorce]]d on 10 November 2015.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11985967/Rowan-Atkinson-divorced-in-65-seconds-on-grounds-of-his-unreasonable-behaviour.html | title=Rowan Atkinson divorced in 65 seconds on grounds of his 'unreasonable behaviour' | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=10 November 2015 | access-date=11 November 2015}}</ref> Atkinson has been in a relationship with comedian [[Louise Ford]] since 2014; she gave birth to Atkinson's third child in December 2017.<ref name=\"duncan1\"/>

=== Political activism ===
In June 2005, Atkinson led a coalition of the United Kingdom's most prominent actors and writers, including [[Nicholas Hytner]], [[Stephen Fry]], and [[Ian McEwan]], to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in an attempt to force a review of the controversial [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006|Racial and Religious Hatred Bill]], which they felt would give overwhelming power to religious groups to impose censorship on the arts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article535556.ece|title=Rowan Atkinson leads crusade against religious hatred Bill|last=Freeman|first=Simon|date=20 June 2005|work=The Times|location=UK|access-date=22 September 2009}}</ref>
In 2009, he criticized [[Homophobia|homophobic]] speech legislation, saying that the [[House of Lords]] must vote against a government attempt to remove a free speech clause in an anti-gay hate law.<ref>{{cite news|last=Geen|first=Jessica|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-11670.html|title=Rowan Atkinson attacks gay hate law|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|access-date=21 June 2011|date=19 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610223606/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-11670.html|archive-date=10 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Atkinson opposed the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] to outlaw inciting religious hatred, arguing that, \"freedom to criticise ideas — any ideas even if they are sincerely held beliefs — is one of the fundamental freedoms of society. And the law which attempts to say you can criticise or ridicule ideas as long as they are not religious ideas is a very peculiar law indeed.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4073997.stm | title=Atkinson's religious hate worry | work=BBC News | date=7 December 2004 | access-date=9 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1478381/Atkinson-defends-right-to-offend.html | title=Atkinson defends right to offend | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=7 December 2004 | access-date=9 January 2016}}</ref>

In October 2012, he voiced his support for the [[Hate speech laws in the United Kingdom#Reform Section 5 campaign|Reform Section 5 campaign]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9616750/Rowan-Atkinson-we-must-be-allowed-to-insult-each-other.html|title=Rowan Atkinson: we must be allowed to insult each other|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 October 2012|access-date=21 October 2012|location=London}}</ref> which aims to reform or repeal Section 5 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]], particularly its statement that an [[Harassment, alarm or distress|insult]] can be grounds for arrest and punishment. It is a reaction to several recent high-profile arrests, which Atkinson sees as a restriction of freedom of expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reformsection5.org.uk/2012/10/rowan-atkinsons-speech-at-rs5-parliamentary-reception|title=Rowan Atkinson's address to the Reform Section 5 parliamentary reception|date= 16 October 2012 |publisher=reformsection5.org.uk|access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref> In February 2014 Parliament passed a redaction of the [[statute]] which removed the word insulting following pressure from citizens.<ref>The [[Crime and Courts Act 2013]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/22/section/57 section 57(2)]</ref><ref>SI 2013/2981, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/2981/article/3/made art 3]</ref>

=== Cars ===
Atkinson holds a category C+E (formerly \"Class 1\") [[Truck|lorry]] [[Driving licence in the United Kingdom|driving licence]], gained in 1981, because lorries held a fascination for him, and to ensure employment as a young actor. He has also used this skill when filming comedy material. In 1991, he starred in the self-penned ''The Driven Man'', a series of sketches featuring Atkinson driving around London trying to solve his obsession with cars, and discussing it with taxi drivers, policemen, used-car salesmen and psychotherapists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=42187|work=The New York Times|title=Rowan Atkinson: The Driven Man&nbsp;— Trailer&nbsp;— Cast&nbsp;— Showtimes|first=Manohla|last=Dargis|date=7 February 2005}}</ref> A lover of and participant in car racing, he appeared as racing driver [[Tim Birkin|Henry Birkin]] in the television play ''Full Throttle'' in 1995.
[[File:Rowan Atkinson at Goodwood Revival 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Atkinson racing in a [[Jaguar Mark VII]] M at the [[Goodwood Revival]] motor racing festival in England in 2009]]

Atkinson has raced in other cars, including a [[Renault 5 GT Turbo]] for two seasons for its [[Renault Clio Cup|one make series]]. From 1997 to 2015, he owned a rare [[McLaren F1]], which was involved in an accident in Cabus, near [[Garstang]], Lancashire, with an [[Austin Metro]] in October 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/485692.stm|work=BBC News|title=Mr Bean crashes sports car|date=27 October 1999}}</ref> It was damaged again in a serious crash in August 2011 when it caught fire after Atkinson reportedly lost control and hit a tree.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dunning|first=Craig|title=Mr Bean and Blackadder star Rowan Atkinson in hospital after McLaren F1 supercar crash|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 August 2011|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/story-e6freuy9-1226109003161|access-date =5 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/news/cambridgeshire_tv_star_rowan_atkinson_in_hospital_following_crash_1_985153|title= Update: TV star Rowan Atkinson in hospital following Cambridgeshire crash|work= Evening Star}}</ref> That accident caused significant damage to the vehicle, taking over a year to be repaired and leading to the largest insurance payout in Britain, at £910,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Warnes|first=Sophie|title=Rowan Atkinson crash forces insurers to pay out record £910,000 to repair supercar|work=The Independent|date=7 February 2013|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rowan-atkinson-crash-forces-insurers-to-pay-out-record-910000-to-repair-supercar-8486081.html|access-date =26 March 2015|location=London}}</ref> He has previously owned a [[Honda NSX]],<ref name=tgs16>Top Gear Series 17, episode 4</ref> an [[Audi A8]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/the-cars-of-the-stars-rowan-atkinson.aspx |title=The cars of the stars: Rowan Atkinson |publisher=bankrate.com |access-date=30 April 2014}}</ref> a [[Škoda Superb]], and a [[Honda Civic Hybrid]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Wormald |first=Andrew |url=http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147861295 |title=Stars & their Cars: Rowan Atkinson |publisher=MSN |date=31 May 2011 |access-date=21 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918033603/http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147861295 |archivedate=18 September 2009}}</ref>

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician [[Alan Clark]], a devotee of classic motor cars, recorded in his published ''[[Alan Clark Diaries|Diaries]]'' a chance meeting with a man he later realized was Atkinson while driving through [[Oxfordshire]] in May 1984: \"Just after leaving the motorway at Thame I noticed a dark red [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS V8]] Aston Martin on the slip road with the bonnet up, a man unhappily bending over it. I told Jane to pull in and walked back. A DV8 in trouble is always good for a gloat.\" Clark writes that he gave Atkinson a lift in his [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]] to the nearest telephone box, but was disappointed in his bland reaction to being recognised, noting that: \"he didn't sparkle, was rather disappointing and [[wikt:chétif|chétif]].\"<ref>Alan Clark Diaries (Phoenix, 1993) p. 80</ref>

In July 2001, Atkinson crashed an [[Aston Martin V8 Zagato]] at an enthusiasts' meeting, but walked away unhurt. This was while he was competing in the ''[[Aston Martin Owners Club]]'' event, at the [[Croft Circuit|Croft Racing Circuit]], [[Darlington]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Atkinson unharmed after car crash|work=BBC News|date=9 July 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1430754.stm|access-date=27 February 2016}}</ref>

One car Atkinson has said he will not own is a [[Porsche]]: \"I have a problem with Porsches. They're wonderful cars, but I know I could never live with one. Somehow, the typical Porsche people&nbsp;— and I wish them no ill&nbsp;— are not, I feel, my kind of people.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=\"awardref\">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|title=Museum.tv|publisher=Museum.tv|access-date=21 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005150240/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|archive-date=5 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In July 2011, Atkinson appeared as the \"[[Star in a Reasonably Priced Car]]\" on ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', driving the Kia Cee'd around the track in 1:42.2, which at the time granted him first place on the leaderboard, with only [[Matt LeBlanc]] having set a faster time in the Cee'd.<ref name=\"tgs16\" />

=== Honours ===
Atkinson was appointed Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[2013 Birthday Honours]] for services to drama and charity.<ref name=gaz31712>{{London Gazette|issue=60534 |supp=y|page=7|date=15 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22904807 |title=Birthday Honours: Adele joins Blackadder stars on list |work=BBC News |date=14 June 2013 |access-date=8 September 2013}}</ref>

'''''Mariner 10''''' was an American [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[space probe]] launched by [[NASA]] on 3 November 1973, to fly by the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]. It was the first spacecraft to perform flybys of multiple planets.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404|isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' was launched approximately two years after ''[[Mariner 9]]'' and was the last spacecraft in the [[Mariner program]]. (Mariner 11 and 12 were allocated to the [[Voyager program]] and redesignated ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]''.)

The mission objectives were to measure Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the [[interplanetary medium]] and to obtain experience with a dual-planet [[gravity assist]] mission. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s science team was led by [[Bruce C. Murray]] at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].<ref name=Schudel>{{cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Bruce C.

''Mariner 10'' was the first spacecraft to make use of an interplanetary [[gravitational slingshot]] maneuver, using Venus to bend its flight path and bring its [[perihelion]] down to the level of Mercury's orbit.<ref name=\"Mission Overview\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=2 February 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140219012506/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|archive-date=19 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404 |isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> This maneuver, inspired by the [[orbital mechanics]] calculations of the Italian scientist [[Giuseppe Colombo]], put the spacecraft into an orbit that repeatedly brought it back to Mercury. ''Mariner 10'' used the solar [[radiation pressure]] on its [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and its high-gain antenna as a means of [[attitude control]] during flight, the first spacecraft to use active solar pressure control.

The components on ''Mariner 10'' can be categorized into four groups based on their common function. The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub, which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism. The hub stored the spacecraft's internal electronics.<ref name=\"NSSDC\"/><ref>Clark 2007, pp. 22-23 </ref><ref name=\"Strom16\"/> The Mariner 10 spacecraft was manufactured by Boeing.<ref name=\"Mariner 10 Quicklook\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10 Quicklook |url=http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/mariner10QL.html&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> NASA set a strict limit of US$98 million for Mariner 10's total cost, which marked the first time the agency subjected a mission to an inflexible budget constraint. No overruns would be tolerated, so mission planners carefully considered cost efficiency when designing the spacecraft's instruments.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 222</ref> Cost control was primarily accomplished by executing contract work closer to the launch date than was recommended by normal mission schedules, as reducing the length of available work time increased cost efficiency. Despite the rushed schedule, very few deadlines were missed.<ref name=\"Biggs\"/> The mission ended up about US$1 million under budget.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 142</ref>

The flyby past Mercury posed major technical challenges for scientists to overcome. Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32–33</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 °C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76°.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30–32</ref>

Accurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25–26</ref>

The mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)

== Instruments ==
[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]

''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury. Six of these experiments had a dedicated scientific instrument to collect data.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p.19</ref> The experiments and instruments were designed by research laboratories and educational institutions from across the United States.<ref>Giberson and Cunningham 1975, p. 719</ref> Out of forty-six submissions, JPL selected seven experiments on the basis of maximizing science return without exceeding cost guidelines: together, the seven scientific experiments cost US12.6 million dollars, about one-eighth of the total mission budget.<ref name=\"Biggs\">{{Citation|last=Biggs|first=John R.|author-link=|last2=Downhower|first2=Walter J.|author2-link=|title=Mariner Venus/Mercury '73: A Strategy of Cost Control|journal=Astronautics & Aeronautics|volume=12|issue=5|pages=48–53|publisher=The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=New York|date=June 1974|language=|url=|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Television photography===
The imaging system, the Television Photography Experiment, consisted of two {{convert|15|cm}} [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] telescopes feeding [[vidicon]] tubes.<ref name=nssdccam>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-01 NASA/NSSDC – Mariner 10 – Television Photography]</ref> The main telescope could be bypassed to a smaller wide angle optic, but using the same tube.<ref name=nssdccam/> It had an 8-position filter wheel, with one position occupied by a mirror for the wide-angle bypass.<ref name=nssdccam/>

The entire imaging system was imperiled when electric heaters attached to the cameras failed to turn on immediately after launch. To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 °C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43–48</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on. This allowed the vidicons to be turned off as needed.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 57–58</ref>

Of the six main scientific instruments, the {{convert|43.6|kg}} cameras were by far the most massive device. Requiring 67 watts of electricity, the cameras consumed more power than the other five instruments combined.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> The system returned about 7000 photographs of Mercury and Venus during Mariner 10's flybys.<ref name=nssdccam/>

===Infrared radiometer===
The infrared [[radiometer]] detected [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] given off by the surface of Mercury and the atmosphere of Venus, from which the temperature could be calculated. How quickly the surface lost heat as it rotated into the planet's dark side revealed aspects about the composition of the surface, such as whether it was made out of rocks, or out of finer particles.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 21-22</ref><ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> The infrared radiometer contained a pair of Cassegrain telescopes fixed at an angle of 120° to each other and a pair of detectors made from antimony-bismuth [[thermopile]]s. The instrument was designed to measure temperatures as cold as -193 °C and as hot as 427 °C. Stillman C. Chase, Jr. of the Santa Barbara Research Center headed the infrared radiometer experiment.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\">{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Science Instrument Survey|publisher=Ames Research Center, NASA|series=|volume=|edition=|date=May 1973 |location=Moffett Field|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143/page/n153 148]–167|language=|url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143|doi=|id=|isbn=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Ultraviolet spectrometers===
Two ultraviolet [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] were involved in this experiment, one to measure UV absorption, the other to sense UV emissions. The occultation spectrometer scanned Mercury's edge as it passed in front of the Sun, and detected whether solar ultraviolet radiation was absorbed in certain wavelengths, which would indicate the presence of gas particles, and therefore an atmosphere.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 25-26</ref> The [[airglow]] spectrometer detected extreme ultraviolet radiation emanating from atoms of gaseous hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and argon.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/><ref>Rothery 2015, p. 26</ref> Unlike the occultation spectrometer, it did not require backlighting from the Sun and could move along with the rotatable scan platform on the spacecraft. The experiment's most important goal was to ascertain whether Mercury had an atmosphere, but would also gather data at Earth and Venus and study the interstellar background radiation.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 18-19</ref>

===Plasma detectors===
The plasma experiment's goal was to study the ionized gases ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) of the solar wind, the temperature and density of its electrons, and how the planets affected the velocity of the plasma stream.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer and Electron Spectrometer|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|work=National Space Science Data Center|date=|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-03|format=|doi=|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> The experiment contained two components, facing in opposite directions. The Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer was aimed toward the Sun and could detect positive ions and electrons, which were separated by a set of three concentric hemispherical plates. The Scanning Electron Spectrometer has aimed away from the Sun, and detected only electrons, using just one hemispherical plate. The instruments could be rotated about 60° to either side.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> By gathering data on the solar wind's movement around Mercury, the plasma experiment could be used to verify the magnetometer's observations of Mercury's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> Using the plasma detectors, Mariner 10 gathered the first ''in situ'' solar wind data from inside Venus' orbit.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 22-23</ref>

Shortly after launch, scientists found that the Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer had failed because a door shielding the analyzer did not open. An unsuccessful attempt was made to forcibly unfasten the door with the first course correction maneuver.<ref name=\"No. 7\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 7: First Trajectory Correction Maneuver A Success|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=13 November 1973|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-07.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> The experiment operators had planned to observe the directions taken by positive ions prior to the ions' collision with the Analyzer, but this data was lost.<ref name=\"No. 15\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 15: Venus Flyby Set For Tuesday at 10:01 A.M.

===Charged particle telescopes===
The goal of the charged particles experiment was to observe how the [[heliosphere]] interacted with [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]].<ref name=\"Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 19 </ref> In connection with the plasma detectors and magnetometers, this experiment had the potential to provide additional evidence of a magnetic field around Mercury,<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 28</ref> by showing whether such a field had captured charged particles.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> Two telescopes were used to collect highly energetic electrons and atomic nuclei, specifically oxygen nuclei or less massive.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\">Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24</ref> These particles then passed through a set of detectors and were counted.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/>

===Magnetometers===
Two fluxgate magnetometers were entrusted with discerning whether Mercury produced a [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]],<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 27</ref> and studying the interplanetary magnetic field between flybys.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\"/> In designing this experiment, scientists had to account for interference from the magnetic field generated by Mariner 10's many electronic parts. For this reason, the magnetometers had to be situated on a long boom, one closer to the octagonal hub, the other one further away. Data from the two magnetometers would be cross-referenced to filter out the spacecraft's own magnetic field.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 95</ref> Drastically weakening the probe's magnetic field would have increased costs.<ref name=\"Shirley\"/>

===Celestial Mechanics and Radio Science experiment===
This experiment investigated the mass and gravitational characteristics of Mercury. It was of particular interest because of the planet's closeness to the Sun, large orbital eccentricity, and unusual spin-orbit resonance.<ref name=NASAHistory/>

As the spacecraft passed behind Mercury on the first encounter there was an opportunity to probe the atmosphere and to measure the radius of the planet. By observing phase changes in the S-band radio signal, measurements of the atmosphere could be made. The atmosphere was assessed as having a density of about {{val| |e=16|u=molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref name=NASAHistory>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/ mariner.htm History article on Mariner 10 at history.nasa.gov]</ref>

== Departing the Earth–Moon system ==
[[File:Earth & Moon by Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|left|''Mariner 10'' imaged the Earth and Moon shortly after launch.]]

Boeing finished building the spacecraft at the end of June 1973, and ''Mariner 10'' was delivered from Seattle to JPL's headquarters in California, where JPL comprehensively tested the integrity of the spacecraft and its instruments. After the tests were finished, the probe was transported to the [[Eastern Test Range]] in Florida, the launch site. Technicians filled a tank on the spacecraft with {{convert|29|kg}} of hydrazine fuel so that the probe could make course corrections, and attached [[Squib (explosive)|squibs]], whose detonation would signal ''Mariner 10'' to exit the launch rocket and deploy its instruments.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 42</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 36-37</ref> The planned gravity assist at Venus made it feasible to use an [[Atlas-Centaur]] rocket instead of a more powerful but more expensive [[Titan IIIC]].<ref name=\"Paul\">{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Floyd A.|authorlink=|title=Technical Memorandum 33-759: A Study of Mariner 10 Flight Experiences and Some Flight Piece Part Failure Rate Computations|website=|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=January 15, 1976|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760010079.pdf|format=|doi=

On 3 November at 17:45 UTC, the Atlas-Centaur carrying ''Mariner 10'' lifted off from pad [[Spaceport Florida Launch Complex 36|SLC-36B]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/displayTrajectory.action?id=1973-085A|title=Mariner 10 Launch and Trajectory Information|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> The Atlas stage burned for around four minutes, after which it was jettisoned, and the Centaur stage took over for an additional five minutes, propelling ''Mariner 10'' to a [[parking orbit]]. The temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around Earth: this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the Centaur engines, which set ''Mariner 10'' on a path towards Venus. The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision. Never before had a planetary mission depended upon two separate rocket burns during the launch, and even with ''Mariner 10'', scientists initially viewed the maneuver as too risky.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowles|first=Mark D.|authorlink=

During its first week of flight, the ''Mariner 10'' camera system was tested by taking five [[Panoramic photography|photographic mosaics]] of the [[Earth]] and six of the [[Moon]]. It also obtained photographs of the north polar region of the Moon where prior coverage was poor. These photographs provided a basis for cartographers to update lunar maps and improve the [[Selenographic coordinates|lunar control net]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 47–53.</ref>

== Cruise to Venus ==
[[File:Mariner-10-Trajectory-first half.PNG|thumb|left|The trajectory of ''Mariner 10'' spacecraft: since launch on 3 November 1973, to first fly-by of Mercury on 29 March 1974.]]

Far from being an uneventful cruise, ''Mariner 10''{{’}}s three-month journey to Venus was fraught with technical malfunctions, which kept mission control on edge.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 55</ref> [[Donna Shirley]] recounted her team's frustration: \"It seemed as if we were always just patching Mariner 10 together long enough to get it on to the next phase and next crisis\".<ref>Shirley 1998, p. 91 </ref> A trajectory correction maneuver was made on 13 November 1973. Immediately afterward, the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star [[Canopus]]. An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator. Mission planners feared that the same problem could recur in the redundant system and cripple the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 55</ref>

In January 1974, ''Mariner 10'' made ultraviolet observations of [[Comet Kohoutek]]. Another mid-course correction was made on 21 January 1974.

== Venus flyby ==
The spacecraft passed Venus on 5 February 1974, the closest approach being {{convert|5768|km}} at 17:01 UTC. It was the twelfth spacecraft to reach Venus and the eighth to return data from the planet,<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David R.|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|title=Chronology of Venus Exploration|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |work=National Space Science Data Center|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=8 September 2015|archivedate=July 30, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730111434/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as the first mission to succeed in broadcasting images of Venus back to Earth.<ref name=\"Ulivi181\">Ulivi and Harland 2007, p. 181</ref> ''Mariner 10'' built upon observations made by ''Mariner 5'' six years earlier; importantly, ''Mariner 10'' had a camera whereas the prior mission lacked one.<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\">Reeves 1994, p. 244</ref> As ''Mariner 10'' veered around Venus, from the planet's night side to daylight, the cameras snapped the probe's first image of Venus, showing an illuminated arc of clouds over the north pole emerging from darkness. Engineers initially feared that the star-tracker could mistake the much brighter Venus for Canopus, repeating the mishaps with flaking paint. However, the star-tracker did not malfunction. Earth occultation occurred between 17:07 UTC and 17:11 UTC, during which the spacecraft transmitted X-band radio waves through Venus' atmosphere, gathering data on cloud structure and temperature.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 61-64</ref><ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 61-63</ref> Although Venus's cloud cover is nearly featureless in visible light, it was discovered that extensive cloud detail could be seen through Mariner's ultraviolet camera filters. Earth-based ultra-violet observation had shown some indistinct blotching even before ''Mariner 10'', but the detail seen by Mariner was a surprise to most researchers. The probe continued photographing Venus until 13 February 1974.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 79 </ref> Among the encounter's 4165 acquired photographs, one resulting series of images captured a thick and distinctly patterned atmosphere making a full revolution every four days,<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\"/> just as terrestrial observations had suggested.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 68</ref>

The mission revealed the composition and meteorological nature of the atmosphere of Venus. Data from the radio science experiment measured the extent to which radio waves passing through the atmosphere were refracted, which was used to calculate the density, pressure, and temperature of the atmosphere at any given altitude.<ref name=\"Howard\">{{cite journal|first1=H.

== End of mission ==
With its maneuvering gas just about exhausted, ''Mariner 10'' started another orbit of the Sun. Engineering tests were continued until 24 March 1975,<ref name=\"Mission Overview\"/> when final depletion of the nitrogen supply was signaled by the onset of an un-programmed pitch turn. Commands were sent immediately to the spacecraft to turn off its transmitter, and radio signals to Earth ceased.

''Mariner 10'' is presumably still [[heliocentric orbit|orbiting the Sun]], although its electronics have probably been damaged by the Sun's radiation.<ref>[http://www.space.com/18301-mariner-10.html  Elizabeth Howell, SPACE.com Contributor Article on mariner-10 at space.com]</ref> ''Mariner 10'' has not been spotted or tracked from Earth since it stopped transmitting. The only ways it would not be orbiting would be if it had been hit by an asteroid or gravitationally perturbed by a close encounter with a large body.

== Discoveries ==
During its flyby of Venus, ''Mariner 10'' discovered evidence of rotating clouds and a very weak magnetic field. Using a near-[[ultraviolet]] filter, it photographed Venus's [[Cirrus uncinus cloud|chevron clouds]] and performed other [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies.

The spacecraft flew past Mercury three times. Owing to the geometry of its orbit – its orbital period was almost exactly twice Mercury's – the same side of Mercury was sunlit each time, so it was only able to [[map]] 40–45% of Mercury's surface, taking over 2800 photos. It revealed a more or less Moon-like surface. It thus contributed enormously to our understanding of Mercury, whose surface had not been successfully resolved through telescopic observation. The regions mapped included most or all of the Shakespeare, Beethoven, Kuiper, Michelangelo, Tolstoj, and Discovery [[list of quadrangles on Mercury |quadrangle]]s, half of Bach and Victoria quadrangles, and small portions of Solitudo Persephones (later Neruda), Liguria (later Raditladi), and Borealis quadrangles.<ref name=\"h8.pdf\">{{cite book |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/PlanetaryMapping/DIGGEOL/mercury/h8/h8.pdf|title=Geologic Map of the Tolstoj (H-8) Quadrangle of Mercury|last1= Schaber|first1=Gerald G.|last2=McCauley|first2=John F.|id=USGS Miscellaneous Investigations Series Map I–1199, as part of the Atlas of Mercury, 1:5,000,000 Geologic Series|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' also discovered that Mercury has a tenuous [[Atmosphere of Mercury|atmosphere]] consisting primarily of [[helium]], as well as a [[magnetic field]] and a large iron-rich [[planetary core|core]]. Its radiometer readings suggested that Mercury has a nighttime temperature of −183 °C (−297 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) and maximum daytime temperatures of 187 °C (369 °F).

Planning for ''[[MESSENGER]]'', a spacecraft that surveyed Mercury until 2015, relied extensively on data and information collected by ''Mariner 10''.

'''''Mariner 10''''' was an American [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[space probe]] launched by [[NASA]] on 3 November 1973, to fly by the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]. It was the first spacecraft to perform flybys of multiple planets.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404|isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' was launched approximately two years after ''[[Mariner 9]]'' and was the last spacecraft in the [[Mariner program]]. (Mariner 11 and 12 were allocated to the [[Voyager program]] and redesignated ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]''.)

The mission objectives were to measure Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the [[interplanetary medium]] and to obtain experience with a dual-planet [[gravity assist]] mission. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s science team was led by [[Bruce C. Murray]] at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].<ref name=Schudel>{{cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Bruce C.

''Mariner 10'' was the first spacecraft to make use of an interplanetary [[gravitational slingshot]] maneuver, using Venus to bend its flight path and bring its [[perihelion]] down to the level of Mercury's orbit.<ref name=\"Mission Overview\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=2 February 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140219012506/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_10&Display=ReadMore|archive-date=19 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404 |isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> This maneuver, inspired by the [[orbital mechanics]] calculations of the Italian scientist [[Giuseppe Colombo]], put the spacecraft into an orbit that repeatedly brought it back to Mercury. ''Mariner 10'' used the solar [[radiation pressure]] on its [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and its high-gain antenna as a means of [[attitude control]] during flight, the first spacecraft to use active solar pressure control.

The components on ''Mariner 10'' can be categorized into four groups based on their common function. The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub, which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism. The hub stored the spacecraft's internal electronics.<ref name=\"NSSDC\"/><ref>Clark 2007, pp. 22-23 </ref><ref name=\"Strom16\"/> The Mariner 10 spacecraft was manufactured by Boeing.<ref name=\"Mariner 10 Quicklook\">{{cite web|title=Mariner 10 Quicklook |url=http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/mariner10QL.html&Display=ReadMore|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> NASA set a strict limit of US$98 million for Mariner 10's total cost, which marked the first time the agency subjected a mission to an inflexible budget constraint. No overruns would be tolerated, so mission planners carefully considered cost efficiency when designing the spacecraft's instruments.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 222</ref> Cost control was primarily accomplished by executing contract work closer to the launch date than was recommended by normal mission schedules, as reducing the length of available work time increased cost efficiency. Despite the rushed schedule, very few deadlines were missed.<ref name=\"Biggs\"/> The mission ended up about US$1 million under budget.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 142</ref>

The flyby past Mercury posed major technical challenges for scientists to overcome. Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32–33</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 °C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76°.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30–32</ref>

Accurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25–26</ref>

The mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)

== Instruments ==
[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]

''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury. Six of these experiments had a dedicated scientific instrument to collect data.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p.19</ref> The experiments and instruments were designed by research laboratories and educational institutions from across the United States.<ref>Giberson and Cunningham 1975, p. 719</ref> Out of forty-six submissions, JPL selected seven experiments on the basis of maximizing science return without exceeding cost guidelines: together, the seven scientific experiments cost US12.6 million dollars, about one-eighth of the total mission budget.<ref name=\"Biggs\">{{Citation|last=Biggs|first=John R.|author-link=|last2=Downhower|first2=Walter J.|author2-link=|title=Mariner Venus/Mercury '73: A Strategy of Cost Control|journal=Astronautics & Aeronautics|volume=12|issue=5|pages=48–53|publisher=The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=New York|date=June 1974|language=|url=|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Television photography===
The imaging system, the Television Photography Experiment, consisted of two {{convert|15|cm}} [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] telescopes feeding [[vidicon]] tubes.<ref name=nssdccam>[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-01 NASA/NSSDC – Mariner 10 – Television Photography]</ref> The main telescope could be bypassed to a smaller wide angle optic, but using the same tube.<ref name=nssdccam/> It had an 8-position filter wheel, with one position occupied by a mirror for the wide-angle bypass.<ref name=nssdccam/>

The entire imaging system was imperiled when electric heaters attached to the cameras failed to turn on immediately after launch. To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 °C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43–48</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on. This allowed the vidicons to be turned off as needed.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 57–58</ref>

Of the six main scientific instruments, the {{convert|43.6|kg}} cameras were by far the most massive device. Requiring 67 watts of electricity, the cameras consumed more power than the other five instruments combined.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> The system returned about 7000 photographs of Mercury and Venus during Mariner 10's flybys.<ref name=nssdccam/>

===Infrared radiometer===
The infrared [[radiometer]] detected [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] given off by the surface of Mercury and the atmosphere of Venus, from which the temperature could be calculated. How quickly the surface lost heat as it rotated into the planet's dark side revealed aspects about the composition of the surface, such as whether it was made out of rocks, or out of finer particles.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 21-22</ref><ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> The infrared radiometer contained a pair of Cassegrain telescopes fixed at an angle of 120° to each other and a pair of detectors made from antimony-bismuth [[thermopile]]s. The instrument was designed to measure temperatures as cold as -193 °C and as hot as 427 °C. Stillman C. Chase, Jr. of the Santa Barbara Research Center headed the infrared radiometer experiment.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\">{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Science Instrument Survey|publisher=Ames Research Center, NASA|series=|volume=|edition=|date=May 1973 |location=Moffett Field|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143/page/n153 148]–167|language=|url=https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19930074143|doi=|id=|isbn=|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref>

===Ultraviolet spectrometers===
Two ultraviolet [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] were involved in this experiment, one to measure UV absorption, the other to sense UV emissions. The occultation spectrometer scanned Mercury's edge as it passed in front of the Sun, and detected whether solar ultraviolet radiation was absorbed in certain wavelengths, which would indicate the presence of gas particles, and therefore an atmosphere.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 25-26</ref> The [[airglow]] spectrometer detected extreme ultraviolet radiation emanating from atoms of gaseous hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and argon.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/><ref>Rothery 2015, p. 26</ref> Unlike the occultation spectrometer, it did not require backlighting from the Sun and could move along with the rotatable scan platform on the spacecraft. The experiment's most important goal was to ascertain whether Mercury had an atmosphere, but would also gather data at Earth and Venus and study the interstellar background radiation.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 18-19</ref>

===Plasma detectors===
The plasma experiment's goal was to study the ionized gases ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) of the solar wind, the temperature and density of its electrons, and how the planets affected the velocity of the plasma stream.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer and Electron Spectrometer|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|work=National Space Science Data Center|date=|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-085A-03|format=|doi=|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> The experiment contained two components, facing in opposite directions. The Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer was aimed toward the Sun and could detect positive ions and electrons, which were separated by a set of three concentric hemispherical plates. The Scanning Electron Spectrometer has aimed away from the Sun, and detected only electrons, using just one hemispherical plate. The instruments could be rotated about 60° to either side.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> By gathering data on the solar wind's movement around Mercury, the plasma experiment could be used to verify the magnetometer's observations of Mercury's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Strom-18-19\"/> Using the plasma detectors, Mariner 10 gathered the first ''in situ'' solar wind data from inside Venus' orbit.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 22-23</ref>

Shortly after launch, scientists found that the Scanning Electrostatic Analyzer had failed because a door shielding the analyzer did not open. An unsuccessful attempt was made to forcibly unfasten the door with the first course correction maneuver.<ref name=\"No. 7\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 7: First Trajectory Correction Maneuver A Success|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=13 November 1973|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-07.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> The experiment operators had planned to observe the directions taken by positive ions prior to the ions' collision with the Analyzer, but this data was lost.<ref name=\"No. 15\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 15: Venus Flyby Set For Tuesday at 10:01 A.M.

===Charged particle telescopes===
The goal of the charged particles experiment was to observe how the [[heliosphere]] interacted with [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]].<ref name=\"Strom and Sprague 2003, pp. 19\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 19 </ref> In connection with the plasma detectors and magnetometers, this experiment had the potential to provide additional evidence of a magnetic field around Mercury,<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 28</ref> by showing whether such a field had captured charged particles.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/> Two telescopes were used to collect highly energetic electrons and atomic nuclei, specifically oxygen nuclei or less massive.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\">Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24</ref> These particles then passed through a set of detectors and were counted.<ref name=\"Science Instrument Survey\"/>

===Magnetometers===
Two fluxgate magnetometers were entrusted with discerning whether Mercury produced a [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]],<ref>Rothery 2015, p. 27</ref> and studying the interplanetary magnetic field between flybys.<ref name=\"Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 24\"/> In designing this experiment, scientists had to account for interference from the magnetic field generated by Mariner 10's many electronic parts. For this reason, the magnetometers had to be situated on a long boom, one closer to the octagonal hub, the other one further away. Data from the two magnetometers would be cross-referenced to filter out the spacecraft's own magnetic field.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 95</ref> Drastically weakening the probe's magnetic field would have increased costs.<ref name=\"Shirley\"/>

===Celestial Mechanics and Radio Science experiment===
This experiment investigated the mass and gravitational characteristics of Mercury. It was of particular interest because of the planet's closeness to the Sun, large orbital eccentricity, and unusual spin-orbit resonance.<ref name=NASAHistory/>

As the spacecraft passed behind Mercury on the first encounter there was an opportunity to probe the atmosphere and to measure the radius of the planet. By observing phase changes in the S-band radio signal, measurements of the atmosphere could be made. The atmosphere was assessed as having a density of about {{val| |e=16|u=molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref name=NASAHistory>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/ mariner.htm History article on Mariner 10 at history.nasa.gov]</ref>

== Departing the Earth–Moon system ==
[[File:Earth & Moon by Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|left|''Mariner 10'' imaged the Earth and Moon shortly after launch.]]

Boeing finished building the spacecraft at the end of June 1973, and ''Mariner 10'' was delivered from Seattle to JPL's headquarters in California, where JPL comprehensively tested the integrity of the spacecraft and its instruments. After the tests were finished, the probe was transported to the [[Eastern Test Range]] in Florida, the launch site. Technicians filled a tank on the spacecraft with {{convert|29|kg}} of hydrazine fuel so that the probe could make course corrections, and attached [[Squib (explosive)|squibs]], whose detonation would signal ''Mariner 10'' to exit the launch rocket and deploy its instruments.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 42</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 36-37</ref> The planned gravity assist at Venus made it feasible to use an [[Atlas-Centaur]] rocket instead of a more powerful but more expensive [[Titan IIIC]].<ref name=\"Paul\">{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Floyd A.|authorlink=|title=Technical Memorandum 33-759: A Study of Mariner 10 Flight Experiences and Some Flight Piece Part Failure Rate Computations|website=|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=January 15, 1976|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760010079.pdf|format=|doi=

[[File:Atlas-Centaur launch with Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Launch of ''Mariner 10'']]

On 3 November at 17:45 UTC, the Atlas-Centaur carrying ''Mariner 10'' lifted off from pad [[Spaceport Florida Launch Complex 36|SLC-36B]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/displayTrajectory.action?id=1973-085A|title=Mariner 10 Launch and Trajectory Information|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> The Atlas stage burned for around four minutes, after which it was jettisoned, and the Centaur stage took over for an additional five minutes, propelling ''Mariner 10'' to a [[parking orbit]]. The temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around Earth: this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the Centaur engines, which set ''Mariner 10'' on a path towards Venus. The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision. Never before had a planetary mission depended upon two separate rocket burns during the launch, and even with ''Mariner 10'', scientists initially viewed the maneuver as too risky.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowles|first=Mark D.|authorlink=

During its first week of flight, the ''Mariner 10'' camera system was tested by taking five [[Panoramic photography|photographic mosaics]] of the [[Earth]] and six of the [[Moon]]. It also obtained photographs of the north polar region of the Moon where prior coverage was poor. These photographs provided a basis for cartographers to update lunar maps and improve the [[Selenographic coordinates|lunar control net]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 47–53.</ref>

== Cruise to Venus ==
[[File:Mariner-10-Trajectory-first half.PNG|thumb|left|The trajectory of ''Mariner 10'' spacecraft: since launch on 3 November 1973, to first fly-by of Mercury on 29 March 1974.]]

Far from being an uneventful cruise, ''Mariner 10''{{’}}s three-month journey to Venus was fraught with technical malfunctions, which kept mission control on edge.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 55</ref> [[Donna Shirley]] recounted her team's frustration: \"It seemed as if we were always just patching Mariner 10 together long enough to get it on to the next phase and next crisis\".<ref>Shirley 1998, p. 91 </ref> A trajectory correction maneuver was made on 13 November 1973. Immediately afterward, the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star [[Canopus]]. An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator. Mission planners feared that the same problem could recur in the redundant system and cripple the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 55</ref>

In January 1974, ''Mariner 10'' made ultraviolet observations of [[Comet Kohoutek]]. Another mid-course correction was made on 21 January 1974.

== Venus flyby ==
The spacecraft passed Venus on 5 February 1974, the closest approach being {{convert|5768|km}} at 17:01 UTC. It was the twelfth spacecraft to reach Venus and the eighth to return data from the planet,<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David R.|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|title=Chronology of Venus Exploration|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |work=National Space Science Data Center|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=8 September 2015|archivedate=July 30, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730111434/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_venus.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as the first mission to succeed in broadcasting images of Venus back to Earth.<ref name=\"Ulivi181\">Ulivi and Harland 2007, p. 181</ref> ''Mariner 10'' built upon observations made by ''Mariner 5'' six years earlier; importantly, ''Mariner 10'' had a camera whereas the prior mission lacked one.<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\">Reeves 1994, p. 244</ref> As ''Mariner 10'' veered around Venus, from the planet's night side to daylight, the cameras snapped the probe's first image of Venus, showing an illuminated arc of clouds over the north pole emerging from darkness. Engineers initially feared that the star-tracker could mistake the much brighter Venus for Canopus, repeating the mishaps with flaking paint. However, the star-tracker did not malfunction. Earth occultation occurred between 17:07 UTC and 17:11 UTC, during which the spacecraft transmitted X-band radio waves through Venus' atmosphere, gathering data on cloud structure and temperature.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 61-64</ref><ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 61-63</ref> Although Venus's cloud cover is nearly featureless in visible light, it was discovered that extensive cloud detail could be seen through Mariner's ultraviolet camera filters. Earth-based ultra-violet observation had shown some indistinct blotching even before ''Mariner 10'', but the detail seen by Mariner was a surprise to most researchers. The probe continued photographing Venus until 13 February 1974.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 79 </ref> Among the encounter's 4165 acquired photographs, one resulting series of images captured a thick and distinctly patterned atmosphere making a full revolution every four days,<ref name=\"Reeves 1994, p. 244\"/> just as terrestrial observations had suggested.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 68</ref>

The mission revealed the composition and meteorological nature of the atmosphere of Venus. Data from the radio science experiment measured the extent to which radio waves passing through the atmosphere were refracted, which was used to calculate the density, pressure, and temperature of the atmosphere at any given altitude.<ref name=\"Howard\">{{cite journal|first1=H.

== End of mission ==
With its maneuvering gas just about exhausted, ''Mariner 10'' started another orbit of the Sun. Engineering tests were continued until 24 March 1975,<ref name=\"Mission Overview\"/> when final depletion of the nitrogen supply was signaled by the onset of an un-programmed pitch turn. Commands were sent immediately to the spacecraft to turn off its transmitter, and radio signals to Earth ceased.

''Mariner 10'' is presumably still [[heliocentric orbit|orbiting the Sun]], although its electronics have probably been damaged by the Sun's radiation.<ref>[http://www.space.com/18301-mariner-10.html  Elizabeth Howell, SPACE.com Contributor Article on mariner-10 at space.com]</ref> ''Mariner 10'' has not been spotted or tracked from Earth since it stopped transmitting. The only ways it would not be orbiting would be if it had been hit by an asteroid or gravitationally perturbed by a close encounter with a large body.

== Discoveries ==
During its flyby of Venus, ''Mariner 10'' discovered evidence of rotating clouds and a very weak magnetic field. Using a near-[[ultraviolet]] filter, it photographed Venus's [[Cirrus uncinus cloud|chevron clouds]] and performed other [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies.

The spacecraft flew past Mercury three times. Owing to the geometry of its orbit – its orbital period was almost exactly twice Mercury's – the same side of Mercury was sunlit each time, so it was only able to [[map]] 40–45% of Mercury's surface, taking over 2800 photos. It revealed a more or less Moon-like surface. It thus contributed enormously to our understanding of Mercury, whose surface had not been successfully resolved through telescopic observation. The regions mapped included most or all of the Shakespeare, Beethoven, Kuiper, Michelangelo, Tolstoj, and Discovery [[list of quadrangles on Mercury |quadrangle]]s, half of Bach and Victoria quadrangles, and small portions of Solitudo Persephones (later Neruda), Liguria (later Raditladi), and Borealis quadrangles.<ref name=\"h8.pdf\">{{cite book |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/PlanetaryMapping/DIGGEOL/mercury/h8/h8.pdf|title=Geologic Map of the Tolstoj (H-8) Quadrangle of Mercury|last1= Schaber|first1=Gerald G.|last2=McCauley|first2=John F.|id=USGS Miscellaneous Investigations Series Map I–1199, as part of the Atlas of Mercury, 1:5,000,000 Geologic Series|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref>

''Mariner 10'' also discovered that Mercury has a tenuous [[Atmosphere of Mercury|atmosphere]] consisting primarily of [[helium]], as well as a [[magnetic field]] and a large iron-rich [[planetary core|core]]. Its radiometer readings suggested that Mercury has a nighttime temperature of −183 °C (−297 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) and maximum daytime temperatures of 187 °C (369 °F).

Planning for ''[[MESSENGER]]'', a spacecraft that surveyed Mercury until 2015, relied extensively on data and information collected by ''Mariner 10''.

Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing [[color]]s, [[phoneme]]s (speech sounds), or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color ''blue'' by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as [[light]], it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the note C.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">{{cite journal |author1=Takeuchi, A.

===Influence by music experience===
Absolute pitch sense appears to be influenced by cultural exposure to music, especially in the familiarization of the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] [[musical scale|C-major scale]]. Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five \"black key\" tones,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=The speed of musical pitch identification by absolute-pitch possessors |journal=Music Perception |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=177–188 |doi=10.2307/40285495|jstor=40285495 }}</ref> which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience. One study of Dutch non-musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Absolute pitch in emphasized speech |journal=Acoustics Research Letters Online|volume=3 |year=2002 |pages=77–82 |doi=10.1121/1.1472336 |issue=2}}</ref>

===Linguistics===
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of [[tonal language]]s, such as most dialects of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same—e.g., [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] with four possible tonal variations, [[Cantonese]] with six, [[Southern Min]] with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six.<ref name=jasa138th>{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Dolson | first3 = M. | title = Tone Language Speakers Possess Absolute Pitch | journal = Acoustical Society of America Journal|year=1999 | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | page = 2267 |lay-url=http://www.acoustics.org/press/138th/deutsch.htm|laysource=Acoustics.org | doi=10.1121/1.427738|bibcode = 1999ASAJ..106.2267D}}</ref><ref name=jasa148th>{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Marvin | first3 = E. | last4 = Xu | first4 = H. | title = Perfect Pitch in Tone Language Speakers Carries Over to Music | journal = Acoustical Society of America Journal|year= 2005 | volume = 116 | issue = 4 | page = 2580 |laysource=AIP|lay-url=http://www.aip.org/148th/deutsch.html | doi = 10.1121/1.4808626 |bibcode = 2004ASAJ..116.2580D}}</ref> Speakers of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language<ref name=\"deu-2004\">{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn T. |author3=Dolson, M. |title=Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework |journal=Music Perception|volume=21 |pages=339–356 |year=2004 |doi=10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339 |issue=3|url=http://philomel.com/pdf/MP-2004-21_339-356.pdf }}</ref> (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a [[Pitch accent|pitch-accent language]]).

This phenomenon is apparently unrelated to musical training. The skill may be associated more closely with vocal production. Violin students learning the [[Suzuki method]] are required to memorize each composition in a fixed key and play it from memory on their instrument, but they are not required to sing. When tested, these students did not succeed in singing the memorized Suzuki songs in the original, fixed key.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Saah, Victoria |author2=Marvin, Elizabeth West |year=2004 |chapter=Absolute memory of learned melodies in children trained by the Suzuki violin method |title=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition|pages=736–739 |chapter-url=http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810004816/http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |archive-date=2011-08-10 }}</ref>

===Possible problems===
Musicians with absolute perception may experience difficulties which do not exist for other musicians. Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key, or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency (either sharp or flat), a musician with absolute pitch may become distressed upon perceiving tones believed to be \"wrong\" or hearing a piece of music \"in the wrong key.\" This can especially apply to Baroque music that is recorded in Baroque tuning (usually A = 415&nbsp;Hz as opposed to 440&nbsp;Hz, ''i.e.'', roughly a half step or [[semitone]] lower than standard concert pitch).<ref name=\"Sacks, O. 2007\">{{cite book |author=Sacks, O. |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain |url=https://archive.org/details/musicophilia00oliv |url-access=registration |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-4081-0}}</ref> An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks which are more efficiently accomplished with [[relative pitch|relative strategies]], such as transposition<ref name=\"miy_1993\">{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=Absolute pitch as an inability: Identification of musical intervals in a tonal context |journal=Music Perception |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=55–72 |doi=10.2307/40285599|jstor=40285599}}</ref> or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard [[equal temperament]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Harris, G. B. |year=1974 |title=Categorical perception and absolute pitch |publisher=University of Western Ontario |location=Ontario}}</ref> It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch, where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned to a concert pitch convention other than the one in use, ''e.g.'', A = 435&nbsp;Hz (the [[Paris Opera]] convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries) as opposed to the Anglo-American modern standard A = 440&nbsp;Hz. When playing in groups with other musicians, this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly different from that of the rest of the group.{{citation needed|date = January 2020}}

===Synesthesia===
Absolute pitch shows a genetic overlap with music-related and non-music-related [[synesthesia]]/[[ideasthesia]].<ref name=gregersen_2013/> They may associate certain notes or keys with different colors, enabling them to tell what any note or key is. In this study, about 20% of people with perfect pitch are also synesthetes.

==Correlations==
There is evidence of a higher rate of absolute pitch in the [[autistic]] population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mottron|first1=Laurent|last2=Bouvet|first2=Lucie|last3=Bonnel|first3=Anna|last4=Samson|first4=Fabienne|last5=Burack|first5=Jacob A.|last6=Dawson|first6=Michelle|last7=Heaton|first7=Pamela|date=2013|title=Veridical mapping in the development of exceptional autistic abilities|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=37|issue=2|pages=209–228|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.11.016|issn=1873-7528|pmid=23219745}}</ref>

=== Correlation with musical talent ===
Absolute pitch is not a prerequisite for skilled musical performance or composition. However, musicians with absolute pitch tend to perform better on musical transcription tasks (controlling for age of onset and amount of musical training) compared to those without absolute pitch.<ref name=\"phil-446\">{{cite journal | author=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on musical dictation | journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America| volume= 128 | issue=2| pages= 890–3| year=2010 | pmid=20707458 | doi=10.1121/1.3458848 |bibcode = 2010ASAJ..128..890D|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f75c4936a26a63195692432e86e8bbccf60c82e8 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2010_128_890-893.pdf PDF Document]</ref> It was previously argued that musicians with absolute pitch perform worse than those without absolute pitch on recognition of musical intervals,<ref name=\"miyazaki\">{{cite journal | author=Miyazaki K. | title=Perception of relative pitch with different references: Some absolute-pitch listeners can't tell musical interval names | journal=Perception & Psychophysics| volume=57 | issue=7 | pages= 962–970 | year=1995 | doi=10.3758/bf03205455| pmid=8532499}} [https://doi.org/10.3758%2FBF03205455 PDF Document]</ref> however experiments on which this conclusion was based contained an [[Artifact (error)|artifact]], and when this artifact was removed, absolute pitch possessors were found to perform better than nonpossessors on recognition of musical intervals.<ref name=\"phil-473\">{{cite journal |author1=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on interval naming tasks | journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America| volume=130 | issue=6 |pages=4097–4104 | year=2011 | doi=10.1121/1.3652861 | pmid=22225064 | bibcode=2011ASAJ..130.4097D|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7a4b8c47ac8e53fc44e14abd3c4c3693ef0845f0 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JAS004097.pdf PDF Document]</ref>

== Notable cases ==
Owing to uncertainty in the historical record, it is often impossible to determine whether notable composers and musicians of the past had absolute pitch. Since absolute pitch is rare in European musical culture,<ref name=\"deu_2006b\" /> claims that any particular musician possessed it are difficult to evaluate. Among composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical music era|Classical]] eras, evidence is available only for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who is documented to have demonstrated the ability at age 7.<ref name=\"phil-45\">{{cite journal | doi=10.1121/1.2961141 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The Enigma of Absolute Pitch | journal=Acoustics Today| volume=2 | pages=11–18 | year=2006 | issue=4| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/386ccaf8507b4dfb6d8d92f7ccd996c4d4c93b75 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/AT-2006_2_2.pdf PDF Document]</ref> Experts have only surmised that [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] had it, as indicated from some excerpts from his letters.

==Scientific studies==

===History of study and terminologies===
Scientific study of absolute pitch appears to have commenced in the 19th century, focusing on the phenomenon of musical pitch and methods of measuring it.<ref name=Ellis1876>{{Cite journal |date=November 6, 1876 |author=Ellis, Alexander J |title=On the Sensitiveness of the Ear to Pitch and Change of Pitch in Music |journal=Proceedings of the Musical Association|pages=1–32 |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/jrma/3.1.1 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/ellis76.pdf |access-date=24 August 2010 }}</ref> It would have been difficult for any notion of absolute pitch to have formed earlier because pitch references were not consistent. For example, the note now known as 'A' varied in different local or national musical traditions between what would now be considered as G sharp and B flat before the standardisation of the late 19th century. While the term ''absolute pitch'', or ''absolute ear'', was in use by the late 19th century by both British<ref name=Bosanquet1876>{{Cite journal |year=1876 |author=Bosanquet, R.H.M |title=An Elementary Treaties on Musical Intervals and Temperament |series=with an Account of an Enharmonic Harmonium Exhibited in the Loan Collection of Scientific Instruments |place=London |publisher=Macmillan and Co |page=xiv (n17 in electronic page field) |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924022233088#page/n5/mode/2up |access-date=24 August 2010 }}</ref> and German researchers,<ref name=vonKries>{{Cite journal |year=1892 |author=von Kries, J |title=Über das absolute Gehör |trans-title=About the perfect pitch |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Psychologie  |volume=3 |pages=257–79 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/kreis92.htm |access-date=24 August 2010 }} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/kreis92e.htm Translation by Christopher Aruffo, www.acousticlearning.com]</ref> its application was not universal; other terms such as ''musical ear'',<ref name=Ellis1876/> ''absolute tone consciousness'',<ref name=Otto07>{{Cite journal |year=1907 |author=Abraham, O |title=Das absolute Tonbewußtsein und die Musik |trans-title=Absolute tone consciousness and music |language=German |journal=Sammelbände der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft |volume=8 |pages=486–91 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham07.htm |access-date=25 August 2010 }} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham07e.htm Translation by Christopher Aruffo, www.acousticlearning.com]</ref> or ''positive pitch''<ref name=\"Copp 1916\">{{cite journal|author=Copp, E.F. |year=1916 |title=Musical Ability |journal=Journal of Heredity|volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=297–305 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/fletcher/copp.htm|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110728 }}</ref> were also used to refer to the ability.

===Difference in cognition, not elementary sensation===
Physically and functionally, the auditory system of an absolute listener does not appear to be different from that of a non-absolute listener.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sergeant, D. |title=Experimental investigation of absolute pitch |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|volume=17 |year=1969 |pages=135–143 |doi=10.2307/3344200 |issue=1 |publisher=Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 17, No. 1 |jstor=3344200}}</ref> Rather, \"it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information, presumably involving high-level cortical processing.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gregersen, P.

Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing [[color]]s, [[phoneme]]s (speech sounds), or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color ''blue'' by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as [[light]], it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the note C.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">{{cite journal |author1=Takeuchi, A.

===Influence by music experience===
Absolute pitch sense appears to be influenced by cultural exposure to music, especially in the familiarization of the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] [[musical scale|C-major scale]]. Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five \"black key\" tones,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=The speed of musical pitch identification by absolute-pitch possessors |journal=Music Perception |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=177–188 |doi=10.2307/40285495|jstor=40285495 }}</ref> which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience. One study of Dutch non-musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Absolute pitch in emphasized speech |journal=Acoustics Research Letters Online|volume=3 |year=2002 |pages=77–82 |doi=10.1121/1.1472336 |issue=2}}</ref>

===Linguistics===
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of [[tonal language]]s, such as most dialects of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same—e.g., [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] with four possible tonal variations, [[Cantonese]] with six, [[Southern Min]] with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six.<ref name=jasa138th>{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Dolson | first3 = M. | title = Tone Language Speakers Possess Absolute Pitch | journal = Acoustical Society of America Journal|year=1999 | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | page = 2267 |lay-url=http://www.acoustics.org/press/138th/deutsch.htm|laysource=Acoustics.org | doi=10.1121/1.427738|bibcode = 1999ASAJ..106.2267D}}</ref><ref name=jasa148th>{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Marvin | first3 = E. | last4 = Xu | first4 = H. | title = Perfect Pitch in Tone Language Speakers Carries Over to Music | journal = Acoustical Society of America Journal|year= 2005 | volume = 116 | issue = 4 | page = 2580 |laysource=AIP|lay-url=http://www.aip.org/148th/deutsch.html | doi = 10.1121/1.4808626 |bibcode = 2004ASAJ..116.2580D}}</ref> Speakers of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language<ref name=\"deu-2004\">{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn T. |author3=Dolson, M. |title=Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework |journal=Music Perception|volume=21 |pages=339–356 |year=2004 |doi=10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339 |issue=3|url=http://philomel.com/pdf/MP-2004-21_339-356.pdf }}</ref> (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a [[Pitch accent|pitch-accent language]]).

Many native speakers of a tone language, even those with little musical training, are observed to sing a given song consistently with regard to pitch.

===Possible problems===
Musicians with absolute perception may experience difficulties which do not exist for other musicians. Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key, or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency (either sharp or flat), a musician with absolute pitch may become distressed upon perceiving tones believed to be \"wrong\" or hearing a piece of music \"in the wrong key.\" This can especially apply to Baroque music that is recorded in Baroque tuning (usually A = 415&nbsp;Hz as opposed to 440&nbsp;Hz, ''i.e.'', roughly a half step or [[semitone]] lower than standard concert pitch).<ref name=\"Sacks, O. 2007\">{{cite book |author=Sacks, O. |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain |url=https://archive.org/details/musicophilia00oliv |url-access=registration |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-4081-0}}</ref> An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks which are more efficiently accomplished with [[relative pitch|relative strategies]], such as transposition<ref name=\"miy_1993\">{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=Absolute pitch as an inability: Identification of musical intervals in a tonal context |journal=Music Perception |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=55–72 |doi=10.2307/40285599|jstor=40285599}}</ref> or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard [[equal temperament]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Harris, G. B. |year=1974 |title=Categorical perception and absolute pitch |publisher=University of Western Ontario |location=Ontario}}</ref> It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch, where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned to a concert pitch convention other than the one in use, ''e.g.'', A = 435&nbsp;Hz (the [[Paris Opera]] convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries) as opposed to the Anglo-American modern standard A = 440&nbsp;Hz. When playing in groups with other musicians, this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly different from that of the rest of the group.{{citation needed|date = January 2020}}

===Synesthesia===
Absolute pitch shows a genetic overlap with music-related and non-music-related [[synesthesia]]/[[ideasthesia]].<ref name=gregersen_2013/> They may associate certain notes or keys with different colors, enabling them to tell what any note or key is. In this study, about 20% of people with perfect pitch are also synesthetes.

==Correlations==
There is evidence of a higher rate of absolute pitch in the [[autistic]] population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mottron|first1=Laurent|last2=Bouvet|first2=Lucie|last3=Bonnel|first3=Anna|last4=Samson|first4=Fabienne|last5=Burack|first5=Jacob A.|last6=Dawson|first6=Michelle|last7=Heaton|first7=Pamela|date=2013|title=Veridical mapping in the development of exceptional autistic abilities|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=37|issue=2|pages=209–228|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.11.016|issn=1873-7528|pmid=23219745}}</ref>

=== Correlation with musical talent ===
Absolute pitch is not a prerequisite for skilled musical performance or composition. However, musicians with absolute pitch tend to perform better on musical transcription tasks (controlling for age of onset and amount of musical training) compared to those without absolute pitch.<ref name=\"phil-446\">{{cite journal | author=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on musical dictation | journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America| volume= 128 | issue=2| pages= 890–3| year=2010 | pmid=20707458 | doi=10.1121/1.3458848 |bibcode = 2010ASAJ..128..890D|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f75c4936a26a63195692432e86e8bbccf60c82e8 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2010_128_890-893.pdf PDF Document]</ref> It was previously argued that musicians with absolute pitch perform worse than those without absolute pitch on recognition of musical intervals,<ref name=\"miyazaki\">{{cite journal | author=Miyazaki K. | title=Perception of relative pitch with different references: Some absolute-pitch listeners can't tell musical interval names | journal=Perception & Psychophysics| volume=57 | issue=7 | pages= 962–970 | year=1995 | doi=10.3758/bf03205455| pmid=8532499}} [https://doi.org/10.3758%2FBF03205455 PDF Document]</ref> however experiments on which this conclusion was based contained an [[Artifact (error)|artifact]], and when this artifact was removed, absolute pitch possessors were found to perform better than nonpossessors on recognition of musical intervals.<ref name=\"phil-473\">{{cite journal |author1=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on interval naming tasks | journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America| volume=130 | issue=6 |pages=4097–4104 | year=2011 | doi=10.1121/1.3652861 | pmid=22225064 | bibcode=2011ASAJ..130.4097D|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7a4b8c47ac8e53fc44e14abd3c4c3693ef0845f0 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JAS004097.pdf PDF Document]</ref>

== Notable cases ==
Owing to uncertainty in the historical record, it is often impossible to determine whether notable composers and musicians of the past had absolute pitch. Since absolute pitch is rare in European musical culture,<ref name=\"deu_2006b\" /> claims that any particular musician possessed it are difficult to evaluate. Among composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical music era|Classical]] eras, evidence is available only for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who is documented to have demonstrated the ability at age 7.<ref name=\"phil-45\">{{cite journal | doi=10.1121/1.2961141 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The Enigma of Absolute Pitch | journal=Acoustics Today| volume=2 | pages=11–18 | year=2006 | issue=4| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/386ccaf8507b4dfb6d8d92f7ccd996c4d4c93b75 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/AT-2006_2_2.pdf PDF Document]</ref> Experts have only surmised that [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] had it, as indicated from some excerpts from his letters. By the 19th century, it became more common for the presence of absolute pitch to be recorded, identifying the ability to be present in musicians such as [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[John Philip Sousa]].<ref>Naxos. (2018). \"John Philip Sousa.\" Retrieved from https://www.naxos.com/person/John_Philip_Sousa_24864/24864.htm</ref>
