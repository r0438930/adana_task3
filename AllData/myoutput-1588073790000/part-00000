Under Kaka's orders, he murders a high-profile politician named Kasi Viswanath. \nVishwanath's son Devendra and his brother in law Ramamoorthy swear revenge on Shankar. The film opens with Shankar escaping from jail while being chased by the police. He beats up the police and escapes in a truck where he recollects the past.\n\nWhile extorting money from an apartment builder, he encounters Chandni, who is a fearless girl and even goes to the extent of slapping Shankar. He gets impressed by this and falls for her. After a few altercations, she reciprocates. Once Shankar murders Kasi Vishwanath on Kaka's orders, he escapes to Goa with Chandni.\n\nHowever, the police find out his location and track him down. While escaping, Chandni is shot and killed. Shankar is beside himself with grief and swears to kill the person who killed her.\n\nIn a parallel storyline, Sara is a neuroscientist who is working on memory transfer and has achieved successful results with rats. Her boyfriend, Arun is a CBI officer who is trying to crack the case of the murder of Kasi Vishwanath. He believes there is a higher force that planned and killed him.\n\nShankar finds out that Kaka was ordered to kill him as well and murders Kaka when he plans to escape in Sarah's car. He flees while Sarah calls Arun. Arun catches a guy running but the guy is killed when a car hits him. Arun's higher-ups are after him to find the killer and while Arun is about to crack the case, he is shot and killed by goons. The CBI is desperate to know who the murderer is, so with Sarah's help, they transfer Arun's memory to Shankar, knowing full well doing so will remove his past.\n\nShankar wakes up and experiences shocks and memories that aren't his own. He gets enraged when Sarah reveals the truth to him and realizes that he will not remember Chandni in a few days. He experiences brief flashes where he becomes Arun but reverts to being Shankar.\n\nHe finds Arun's house and discovers a bag that has all the proof who the murderer is, who turns out to be Ramamoorthy and Devendra. He pursues them under the guise of Shankar and in the end, Devendra is killed at the hands of Shankar. The film ends with Shankar/Arun and Sarah going to Hong Kong and proposing marriage to Sarah on Feb 14th, like Arun had planned with Sarah.\n\n==Cast== \n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ram Pothineni]] as Ustad iSmart Shankar / Arun\n* [[Nabha Natesh]] as Chandni\n* [[Nidhhi Agerwal]] as Dr. Sarah\n* [[Satyadev Kancharana]] as Arun \n* [[Puneet Issar]] as Chief Minister Kashi Viswanath\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as Ramamoorthy, Central Minister\n* [[Sayaji Shinde]] as Chandrakanth, [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] Officer\n* [[Madhusudhan Rao (actor)|Madhusudhan Rao]] as Kakarao\n* Raj Deepak Shetty as Devendra Viswanath\n* Getup Srinu as Shankar's friend\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nThe Hyderabad portion of scheduled filming finished in February.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiaglitz.com/ismart-shankar-done-with-hyd-schedule-to-go-to-goa-malayalam-news-230542|title=ISMART SHANKAR' DONE WITH HYD SCHEDULE, TO GO TO GOA|website=India Glitz|access-date=1 June 2019|date=28 February 2019}}</ref> Filming in Goa completed in March.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/puri-jagannadh-and-ram-pothinenis-ismart-shankar-wraps-up-goa-schedule/articleshow/68534902.cms|title=Puri Jagannadh and Ram Pothineni's 'iSmart Shankar' wraps up Goa schedule|website=Times of India |author=Neeshita Nyayapati|date=23 March 2019|access-date=1 June 2019}}</ref> The action scenes of the film were shot in Varanasi during April.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telugucinema.com/news/ismart-shankar-moves-varanasi|title='iSmart Shankar' moves to Varanasi|website=Telugu Cinema|access-date=1 June 2019|date=30 April 2019}}</ref> Filming completed in mid May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiaglitz.com/ismart-shankar-wraps-up-talkie-part-locks-teaser-date-telugu-news-235867|title='ISMART SHANKAR' WRAPS UP TALKIE PART, LOCKS TEASER DATE|website=India Glitz|access-date=1 June 2019|date=12 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = ''<small>iSmart Shankar</small>''\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Mani Sharma]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| caption    = \n| released   = 4 July 2019\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length     = 21:09\n| language   = [[Telugu language|Telugu]]\n| label      = [[Zee Music Company|Zee Music South]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title = [[Devadas (2018 film)|Devadas]]\n| prev_year  = 2018\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc = {{External media\n| audio1 = {{YouTube|FErMIqaJaTc|Audio Jukebox}}}}\n| italic_title = no   <!-- don't remove or it 'clashes' with the DISPLAYTITLE above for lowercase 'i' and throws an ugly error -->\n}}\n{{Track listing\n|headline=Track list\n|| total_length =21:09\n| all_writing = \n| extra_column = Singer(s)\n| title1 = Dimaak Kharaab\n| lyrics1 = Kasarla Shyam\n| extra1 = Keerthana Sharma & Saketh ko\n| length1 = 4:40\n| title2 = Zindabad Zindabad\n| lyrics2 = [[Bhaskarabhatla Ravi Kumar]]  \n| extra2 = Sarath Santhosh  and Ramya Behara\n| length2 = 4:40\n| title3 = iSmart Theme\n| lyrics3 = Bhaskarabhatla Ravi Kumar\n| length3 = 4:12\n| extra3 = [[Anurag Kulkarni]]\n| title4 = Undipo\n| lyrics4 = Bhaskarabhatla Ravi Kumar\n| length4 = 5:09\n| extra4 = Anurag Kulkarni, Ramya Behara\n| title5 = Bonalu\n| lyrics5 = Kasarla Shyam\n| length5 = 5:51\n| extra5 = [[Rahul Sipligunj]], [[Mohana Bhogaraju]]\n}}\n\n==Marketing and release==\nThe teaser of the film was launched on 15 May to coincide with the birthday of [[Ram Pothineni]].<ref name=\":0\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/telugu/ismart-shankar-teaser-ram-pothineni-puri-jagannadh-5728602/|title=iSmart Shankar movie teaser: Ram Pothineni transforms into Puri Jagannadh's hero|first=Manoj|last=Kumar R|website=Indian Express|access-date=31 May 2019|date=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical Reception ===\n[[Firstpost]] gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \"iSmart Shankar is proof enough that Puri Jagannadh is back with a bang.
