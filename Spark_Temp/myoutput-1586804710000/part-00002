The vehicle he was driving was described as a 1984 silver truck with a [[Wind deflector|windblocker]] and a red hood. The Ohio State Police Department and volunteers from various civil society organizations posted over 4,000 photographs of the victims and an identikit of the offender at 130 truck stops and service stations across the state, and 1,350 truck stops in 9 other states through which interstate motorways where the serial killer would ride through, offering $10,000 for information about him. As a result, five people were detained, who at different times were nicknamed \"Dr. No\", but subsequently no charges were filed against any of them and their names were never disclosed to the public. On most of the corpses, biological traces were discovered that, according to the investigators, came from the perpetrator. To establish if the sperm had the same affiliation, a forensic examination was carried out which gave mixed results, due to the fact that all of the victims had engaged in prostitution during life, and authorities stated questioning whether the deaths were actually related. Since no other incriminating evidence was found at the crime scenes, such as fingerprints, hair samples and pieces of clothing, the investigation to this day hasn't established the killer's identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/serial-killer-dr-no/|title=Articles}}</ref>\n===Suspects===\nIn April 1991, a resident of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]], 36-year-old Alvin Wilson, became the main suspect. Wilson, who worked as a trucker and owned two tractors, was among those whose hair samples matched those of the females. Credit card receipts and a number of other evidence indicated his possible responsibility for the Ohio murders. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of assault and attempted murder of a woman in October 1989. After his arrest, the girl contacted police, stating that in 1986, Wilson had picked her up in Akron after paying for her services, and had beat and attempted to strangle her afterwards. Alvin Wilson was tested for any involvement, but no evidence proving his guilt could be found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-04-23-9104230376-story.html|title=LAKE MAN A SUSPECT IN SERIAL MURDERS OHIO INVESTIGATORS COMING TO SEARCH TRUCKS.

In accordance with his occupation, Goble traveled to a several dozen states across the country, where cases of disappearances and murders of prostitutes along interstate highways were recorded. Following his arrest, Goble was investigated for murders in at least 10 states. Nevertheless, he was cleared of suspicion when it came to being the elusive \"Dr. No\", since at the time of the first murder in 1981, he was still in high school, and in the mid-1980s, when the majority of the killings took place, he was serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was stationed outside Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950617/06170345.htm|title=DETECTIVES CREDIT LUCK IN HIGHWAY KILLINGS CASE.

Using DNA profiling, law enforcement agencies were able to prove his guilt in the four murders in Ohio and Illinois, the first of which he committed at age 20 in 1989. His initial arrested was thanks due to a match for an unsolved 1997 rape of a minor in [[Medina County, Ohio]], where he was extradited to stand trial. In the fall of 1990, Legg was already in the police's sights, as he was a suspect in the murder of his stepdaughter, 14-year-old Angela Hicks, in [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]], but as there wasn't enough evidence, he wasn't charged. Although the likelihood of him being \"Dr. No\" is questionable, since Legg was a teenager in the mid-1980s, it has been suggested that he could be responsible for some of the murders. If this theory is true, it links to another theory which proposes that the serial murders were the doing of several different individuals.<ref>[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uYyZljc1cnoJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/arizona-man-charged-in-1992-slaying-linked-by-dna-to-ohio-truck-stop-killings+&cd=15&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru Arizona man charged in 1992 slaying linked by DNA to Ohio truck-stop killings.

The vehicle he was driving was described as a 1984 silver truck with a [[Wind deflector|windblocker]] and a red hood. The Ohio State Police Department and volunteers from various civil society organizations posted over 4,000 photographs of the victims and an identikit of the offender at 130 truck stops and service stations across the state, and 1,350 truck stops in 9 other states through which interstate motorways where the serial killer would ride through, offering $10,000 for information about him. As a result, five people were detained, who at different times were nicknamed \"Dr. No\", but subsequently no charges were filed against any of them and their names were never disclosed to the public. On most of the corpses, biological traces were discovered that, according to the investigators, came from the perpetrator. To establish if the sperm had the same affiliation, a forensic examination was carried out which gave mixed results, due to the fact that all of the victims had engaged in prostitution during life, and authorities stated questioning whether the deaths were actually related. Since no other incriminating evidence was found at the crime scenes, such as fingerprints, hair samples and pieces of clothing, the investigation to this day hasn't established the killer's identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/serial-killer-dr-no/|title=Articles}}</ref>\n===Suspects===\nIn April 1991, a resident of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]], 36-year-old Alvin Wilson, became the main suspect. Wilson, who worked as a trucker and owned two tractors, was among those whose hair samples matched those of the females. Credit card receipts and a number of other evidence indicated his possible responsibility for the Ohio murders. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of assault and attempted murder of a woman in October 1989. After his arrest, the girl contacted police, stating that in 1986, Wilson had picked her up in Akron after paying for her services, and had beat and attempted to strangle her afterwards. Alvin Wilson was tested for any involvement, but no evidence proving his guilt could be found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-04-23-9104230376-story.html|title=LAKE MAN A SUSPECT IN SERIAL MURDERS OHIO INVESTIGATORS COMING TO SEARCH TRUCKS.

In accordance with his occupation, Goble traveled to a several dozen states across the country, where cases of disappearances and murders of prostitutes along interstate highways were recorded. Following his arrest, Goble was investigated for murders in at least 10 states. Nevertheless, he was cleared of suspicion when it came to being the elusive \"Dr. No\", since at the time of the first murder in 1981, he wa still in high school, and in the mid-1980s, when the majority of the killings took place, he was serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was stationed outside Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950617/06170345.htm|title=DETECTIVES CREDIT LUCK IN HIGHWAY KILLINGS CASE.

Using DNA profiling, law enforcement agencies were able to prove his guilt in the four murders in Ohio and Illinois, the first of which he committed at age 20 in 1989. His initial arrested was thanks due to a match for an unsolved 1997 rape of a minor in [[Medina County, Ohio]], where he was extradited to stand trial. In the fall of 1990, Legg was already in the police's sights, as he was a suspect in the murder of his stepdaughter, 14-year-old Angela Hicks, in [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]], but as there wasn't enough evidence, he wasn't charged. Although the likelihood of him being \"Dr. No\" is questionable, since Legg was a teenager in the mid-1980s, it has been suggested that he could be responsible for some of the murders. If this theory is true, it links to another theory which proposes that the serial murders were the doing of several different individuals.<ref>[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uYyZljc1cnoJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/arizona-man-charged-in-1992-slaying-linked-by-dna-to-ohio-truck-stop-killings+&cd=15&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru Arizona man charged in 1992 slaying linked by DNA to Ohio truck-stop killings.
