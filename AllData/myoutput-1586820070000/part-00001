King is best known for advancing [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] through [[nonviolence]] and [[civil disobedience]], inspired by his [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs and the nonviolent activism of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n\nKing led the 1955 [[Montgomery bus boycott]] and later became the first president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he then led an unsuccessful [[Albany Movement|1962 struggle against segregation]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He helped organize the 1963 [[March on Washington]], where he delivered his famous \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]].\n\nOn October 14, 1964, King won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for combating [[Racism in the United States|racial inequality]] through [[nonviolent resistance]]. In 1965, he helped organize the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], capitalism, and the [[Vietnam War]]. FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] considered him a radical and made him an object of the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] from 1963 on. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and, in 1964, mailed King [[FBI\u2013King suicide letter|a threatening anonymous letter]], which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nBefore his death, King was planning a national occupation of [[Washington, D.C.]], to be called the [[Poor People's Campaign]], when he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His death was followed by [[King assassination riots|riots in many U.S. cities]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. assassination conspiracy theories|Allegations]] that [[James Earl Ray]], the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting.\n\nKing was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986. [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.|Hundreds of streets]] in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and [[King County, Washington|a county]] in Washington was rededicated for him. The [[Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\n\n==Early life and education==\n===Birth and name change===\nKing was born '''Michael King Jr.''' on January 15, 1929, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the second of three children to the [[Reverend]] [[Michael King Sr.]] and [[Alberta Williams King|Alberta King]] ({{nee}} Williams).<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book| title=All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half Century of Brown v.

King is best known for advancing [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] through [[nonviolence]] and [[civil disobedience]], inspired by his [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs and the nonviolent activism of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n\nKing led the 1955 [[Montgomery bus boycott]] and later became the first president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he then led an unsuccessful [[Albany Movement|1962 struggle against segregation]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He helped organize the 1963 [[March on Washington]], where he delivered his famous \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]].\n\nOn October 14, 1964, King won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for combating [[Racism in the United States|racial inequality]] through [[nonviolent resistance]]. In 1965, he helped organize the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], capitalism, and the [[Vietnam War]]. FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] considered him a radical and made him an object of the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] from 1963 on. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and, in 1964, mailed King [[FBI\u2013King suicide letter|a threatening anonymous letter]], which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nBefore his death, King was planning a national occupation of [[Washington, D.C.]], to be called the [[Poor People's Campaign]], when he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His death was followed by [[King assassination riots|riots in many U.S. cities]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. assassination conspiracy theories|Allegations]] that [[James Earl Ray]], the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting.\n\nKing was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986. [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.|Hundreds of streets]] in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and [[King County, Washington|a county]] in Washington was rededicated for him. The [[Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\n\n==Early life and education==\n===Birth and name change===\nKing was born '''Michael King Jr.''' on January 15, 1929, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the second of three children to the [[Reverend]] [[Michael King Sr.]] and [[Alberta King]] ({{nee}} Williams).<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book| title=All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half Century of Brown v.

The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Bloody Sunday]] and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.{{sfn|King|1998|p=6}}\n\nOn March 5, King met with officials in the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson Administration]] in order to request an [[injunction]] against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, \"If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line.\"{{sfn|King|1998|pp=276\u201379}} Footage of [[police brutality]] against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=222\u201323}}\n\nKing next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against the State of Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order.
