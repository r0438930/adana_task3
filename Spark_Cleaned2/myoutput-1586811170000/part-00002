It is a true bug and sucks sap from plants.

It is common in North and South America, Central Asia, Africa, Australia,<ref name=\"AG\"/> Brazil, East Indies, Mexico and Hawaii and in most of Europe. It is cosmopolitan in habitat.

The legs are yellow, as are the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] which are three quarters of the length of the body. The apices of the [[femora]], [[tibia]] and [[Arthropod leg|tarsi]] are black. The cylindrical black [[siphunculi]] are wide at the base and one fifth of the body length. The winged female has a fusiform body. Its head and thorax are black, the abdomen yellowish-green with black lateral spots and the antennae are longer than those of the [[apterous]] female.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/> The nymphs vary in colour, being shades of green, tan and gray. They often have a dark head, thorax and wing pads and the distal portion of the abdomen is usually dark green. The body appears dull because it is dusted with wax secretions.

Females continue to produce offspring without mating so long as the weather is favourable for feeding and growth.<ref name=\"FC\"/> Further north, the cotton aphid can be [[holocyclic]] and involve two host species, with a broadleaved tree such as [[Catalpa]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|Rhamnus]] or [[Hibiscus]] acting as the primary host. In Europe it reproduces exclusively by [[apomixis|asexual reproduction]] and can produce nearly fifty generations a year under favourable conditions.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/> In Russia various wild plants are hosts to the overwintering eggs.<ref name=\"AG\">[http://www.agroatlas.ru/en/content/pests/Aphis_gossypii/ AgroAtlas]</ref> Winged forms then migrate to secondary host species in the families [[Rosaceae]], [[Chenopodiaceae]], [[Malvaceae]], [[Cruciferae]], [[Cucurbitaceae]], [[Solanaceae]], [[Compositae]] and others. [[Parthenogenesis]] on these hosts allows large populations of aphids to build up quickly. The life span of a parthenogenic female is about twenty days in which time it can produce up to 85 nymphs.<ref name=\"AG\"/> These mature in about twenty days at 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and in about four days at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/> As autumn approaches, the winged forms migrate back to the primary hosts. Here, both males and sexual females are produced, mating takes place and the females lay eggs which overwinter, ready to repeat the life cycle the following year.<ref name=\"AG\"/>\n\nPredators include [[midges]], [[lacewings]], [[syrphid fly]] larvae, [[Anthocoridae|anthocorid bugs]] and [[ladybirds]] (ladybeetles). Several members of the [[Aphidiinae]] and [[Aphelinidae]] wasp families are [[parasitoids]] of aphids.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/> One which shows promise as a biocontrol agent is ''[[Aphelinus asychis]]''.<ref name=\"Schirmer\"/>\n\n==Host plants==\n[[File:Aphis gossypii01.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Cotton plant]] damaged by Aphis gossypii.]]\nThe cotton aphid has a very wide host range with at least 60 host plants being known in Florida and perhaps 700 worldwide. Among cucurbit vegetables, it can seriously affect [[watermelons]], [[cucumbers]], [[cantaloupes]], [[squash (plant)|squash]] and [[pumpkin]]. Other vegetable crops attacked include [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[eggplant]], [[okra]] and [[asparagus]]. It also affects [[citrus]], [[cotton]] and [[hibiscus]].<ref name=\"FC\"/>\n\n==Economic significance==\nThe adults and nymphs of the cotton aphid feed on the underside of leaves or on the growing tips of shoots, sucking juices from the plant. The foliage may become chlorotic and die prematurely. There is often a great deal of leaf curling and distortion which hinders efficient photosynthesis. Honeydew is excreted by the aphids and this allows sooty moulds to grow, resulting in a decrease in the quantity and quality of the produce. The aphids are a vector of crinkle, [[Mosaic virus|mosaic]], [[Groundnut rosette virus|rosette]], [[Citrus tristeza virus|CTV]] and other virus diseases. The aphids' impact is especially important on vegetable crops such as courgette, melon, cucumber, aubergine and strawberry and on cotton, citrus and mallow.<ref name=\"DAISIE\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2557995}}\n\n[[Category:Aphis|gossypii]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pest insects]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1877]]\n[[Category:Hemiptera of Africa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of insect}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| image = Aphis_gossypii04.jpg\n| image_caption = Adults and nymphs on cotton.\n| genus = Aphis\n| species = gossypii\n| authority = [[Townend Glover|Glover]], 1877\n| synonyms =\n*''A. bauhiniae'' <small>Theobald, 1918</small>\n*''A. citri'' <small>Ashmead, 1909</small>\n*''A. citrulli'' <small>Ashmead, 1882</small>\n*''A. cucumeris'' <small>Forbes, 1883</small>\n*''A. cucurbiti'' <small>Buckton, 1879</small>\n*''A. minuta'' <small>Wilson, 1911</small>\n*''A. monardae'' <small>Oestlund, 1887</small>\n*''Cerosypha gossypii'' <small>Glover, 1877</small>\n*''Doralis frangulae'' <small>Kaltenbach</small><ref name=\"DAISIE\">[http://www.europe-aliens.org/pdf/Aphis_gossypii.pdf DAISIE]</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Aphis gossypii''''' is a tiny insect, an [[aphid]] (\"greenfly\") in the superfamily [[Aphidoidea]] in the order [[Hemiptera]].
