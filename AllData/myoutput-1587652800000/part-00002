These five devices ([[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], [[tabard]], [[caparison]], [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]]/[[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] and [[Banner of arms|banner]]) are decorated with the same [[blazon]] ([[Charge (heraldry)|charges]]).]]\n\nHeraldry was developed in the European [[High Middle Ages]],<ref name=\"CGH 1\u201318\"/> closely associated with the [[Royal court|courtly]] culture of [[chivalry]], [[Latin Church|Latin Christianity]], the [[Crusades]], [[feudalism|feudal]] [[nobility|aristocracy]], and [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchy]] of the time. Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]]. Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages ([[Burgher arms]]). Specific traditions of [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] also develop in the late medieval period. Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to [[municipal coats of arms]] by the 16th century.\n\nWestern heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nWith the decline of European monarchies in favour of [[Republicanism]] in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern [[national flag]]s and [[national emblem]]s adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition.\n\n==Current practice==\n[[File:1952 Trygve Lie Resigns.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Escutcheons]] in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] hall, on which the national arms were to be rendered<ref>https://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/704/0070477.html</ref>]]\nHeraldry flourishes in the modern world; institutions, companies, and private persons continue using coats of arms as their pictorial identification. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the English [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]], Scotland's [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], and the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland|Chief Herald of Ireland]] continue making grants of arms.<ref>See the [http://college-of-arms.gov.uk/#newsletter College of Arms newsletter] for quarterly samplings of English grants and the [http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm Chief Herald of Ireland's webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004045906/http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm |date=2006-10-04 }} for recent Irish grants.</ref> There are heraldic authorities in [[Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|Canada]],<ref>See the [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/main.asp?lang=e Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada].</ref> South Africa, Spain, and Sweden that grant or register coats of arms. In [[South African heraldry|South Africa]], the right to armorial bearings is also determined by [[Roman Dutch law]], due to its origins as a 17th-century colony of the Netherlands.<ref>Cornelius Pama. ''Heraldry of South African families: coats of arms/crests/ancestry.'' (Balkema, Cape Town: 1972)</ref>\n\nHeraldic societies abound in Africa, Asia, Australasia, the Americas and Europe. Heraldry aficionados participate in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], medieval revivals, [[micronation]]s and other related projects. Modern armigers use heraldry to express ancestral and personal heritage as well as professional, academic, civic, and national pride. Little is left of class identification in modern heraldry, where the emphasis is more than ever on expression of identity.<ref>{{harvp|Slater|2003|p=238}}</ref>\n\nHeraldry continues to build on its rich tradition in [[academia]], [[government]], guilds and [[professional associations]], religious institutions, and the military. Nations and their subdivisions \u2013 provinces, states, counties, cities, etc. \u2013 continue to build on the traditions of civic heraldry. The [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, and other religious institutions maintain the traditions of [[ecclesiastical heraldry]] for clergy, religious orders, and schools.\n\nMany of these institutions have begun to employ blazons representing modern objects unknown in the medieval world. For example, some heraldic symbols issued by the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] incorporate symbols such as guns, airplanes, or locomotives. Some scientific institutions incorporate symbols of modern science such as the [[Symbol (chemistry)|atom]] or particular scientific instruments. The arms of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] uses traditional heraldic symbols to depict the harnessing of atomic power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=CUdMRj7qOr8C&pg=PA21&dq=atom+symbol+in+heraldry&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihiN2D48XTAhVB_IMKHa4CClwQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&q=atom%20symbol%20in%20heraldry&f=false|title=Heraldic Design: A Handbook for Students|last=Child|first=Heather|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=9780806300719|language=en}}</ref> Locations with strong associations to particular industries may incorporate associated symbols. The coat of arms of [[Stenungsund Municipality]] in Sweden, pictured right, incorporates a hydrocarbon molecule, alluding to the historical significance of the petrochemical industry in the region.\n\nHeraldry in countries with heraldic authorities continues to be regulated generally by [[Law of heraldic arms|laws]] granting rights to arms and recognizing possession of arms as well as protecting against their misuse. Countries without heraldic authorities usually treat coats of arms as creative property in the manner of [[logo]]s, offering protection under [[copyright law]]s. This is the case in [[Nigerian heraldry|Nigeria]], where most of the components of its heraldic system are otherwise unregulated.\n\nAmong the states ruled by communist regimes, emblems [[Socialist heraldry|resembling the Soviet design]] were adopted in all the [[Warsaw Pact]] states except [[Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and Poland and [[Karelia]]. Since 1989, some of the ex-[[Communist state]]s, as [[Coat of arms of Romania|Romania]] or [[Coat of arms of Russia|Russia]] have reused their original pre-communist heraldry, often with only the symbols of monarchy removed. Other countries such as [[National emblem of Belarus|Belarus]] and [[Emblem of Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] have retained their communist coats of arms or at least kept some of the old heraldry.\n\nWith the independence of the modern nation states of the [[Arab World]] from the First World War onwards, European traditions of heraldry were partially adopted for state emblems. These emblems often involve the [[star and crescent]] symbol taken from the [[Ottoman flag]].\nOther commonly seen symbols are birds, chiefly the [[Eagle of Saladin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/egyptianstudies/2011/05/04/coat-of-arms/|title=Coat of Arms (Eagle of Saladin)|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2015|publisher=Macaulay Honors College}}</ref> and the [[Hawk of Quraish]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} These symbols can be found on the [[Coat of Arms of Egypt]], and [[Coat of Arms of Syria|Syria]], amongst others.\n\n[[Coats of arms and emblems of Africa|Sub-Saharan African flags and emblems]] after [[decolonisation]] often chose emblems based on regional traditions or wildlife. Symbols of a ritual significance according to local custom were generally favoured, such as the [[leopard]] in the arms of [[Benin]], [[Malawi]], [[Somalia]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and, in the form of the black panther, of [[Gabon]].\n\nIn [[Kenya]], the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word [[Harambee]] (lit. \"Let us come together\") is used as a motto in the country's coat of arms. In [[Botswana]] and [[Lesotho]], meanwhile, the word [[Botswana Pula|Pula]] (lit. \"Rain\") is used in like fashion.\n\nIn the coat of arms of [[Swaziland]], a [[lion]] and an [[elephant]] serve as supporters. They are each intended to represent the king and the queen mother respectively, the nation's joint heads of state.\n\n===Variations===\n==== Depending on category of armiger ====\n* [[National coat of arms|National]]\n** [[Arms of dominion|Dominion]]\n** [[Civic heraldry|Civic]]\n* [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|Ecclesiastical]]\n** [[Papal armorial|Papal]]\n* [[Burgher arms|Burgher]]\n* [[Women in heraldry|Female]]\n* [[Attributed arms|Attributed]]\n*[[Arms of alliance|Alliance]]\n*[[Heraldic courtesy|Courtesy]]\n*[[Naval heraldry|Naval]]\n*[[Jewish heraldry|Jewish]]\n\n====Depending on geography====\n{{Main|National heraldic styles}}\nThe emergence of heraldry occurred across [[western Europe]] almost simultaneously in the various countries. Originally, heraldic style was very similar from country to country.<ref>Davies, T. R. (Spring 1976). \"Did National Heraldry Exist?\". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''NS II''' (97): 16.</ref> Over time, heraldic tradition diverged into four broad styles: German-Nordic, Gallo-British, Latin, and Eastern.<ref>{{harvp|von Warnstedt|1970|p=128}}</ref> In addition it can be argued that newer national heraldic traditions, such as [[South Africa]]n and Canadian, have emerged in the 20th century.<ref>Alan Beddoe, revised by Strome Galloway. ''Beddoe's Canadian Heraldry''. (Mika Publishing Company, Belleville: 1981).</ref>\n\n==General concepts==\nThese general concepts apply for armorial bearings and, in practice to a lesser extent, [[vexillology]].\n\n===Blazon===\n{{Main|Blazon}}\nTo \"blazon\" arms means to describe them using the formal language of heraldry. This language has its own vocabulary and [[syntax]], or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. The verb comes from the [[Middle English]] ''blasoun'', itself a derivative of the French ''blason'' meaning \"shield\". The system of [[blazon]]ing arms used in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries today was developed by heraldic officers in the [[Middle Ages]]. The blazon includes a description of the arms contained within the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] or shield, the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] where present, [[motto]] and other insignia. Complex rules, such as the [[rule of tincture]], apply to the physical and artistic form of newly created arms, and a thorough understanding of these rules is essential to the art of heraldry. Though heraldic forms initially were broadly similar across Europe, several national styles had developed by the end of the [[Middle Ages]], and artistic and blazoning styles today range from the very simple to extraordinarily complex.\n\nThe [[blazon]] is the formal description of the escutcheon, and may also be extended to describe the other devices in the achievement. The blazon of the escutcheon may traditionally also be used to decorate [[Banner of arms|banners]], [[Mantle and pavilion (heraldry)|mantles]], garments ([[surcoat]]s, [[tabard]]s, [[robe]]s and [[caparison]]s), furniture and structural elements.\n\n===Tinctures===\n{{Main|Tincture (heraldry)}}\n[[File:Heraldic tincture.jpg|thumb|Coloured and monochrome [[Hatching (heraldry)|hatched]] version of heraldic devices]]\nOne of the most distinctive qualities of heraldry is the use of a limited palette of colours and patterns, usually referred to as [[tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]].  These are divided into three categories, known as ''metals'', ''colours'', and ''furs''.{{efn-lr|Technically, the word ''tincture'' applies specifically to the colours, rather than to the metals or the furs; but for lack of another term including all three, it is regularly used in this extended sense.}}<ref>{{harvp|Fox-Davies|1909|p=70}}</ref>\n\n{{Tinctures}}\n\n===Differencing and cadency===\n{{Main|Cadency}}\nCadency is any systematic way to distinguish [[Coat of arms|arms]] displayed by [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s of the holder of a [[coat of arms]] when those family members have not been granted arms in their own right.  Cadency is necessary in heraldic systems in which a given design may be owned by only one person at any time, generally the head of the senior line of a particular family.  As an [[armiger]]'s arms may be used 'by courtesy', either by children or spouses, while they are still living, some form of differencing may be required so as not to confuse them with the original ''undifferenced'' or \"plain coat\" arms. Historically, arms were only heritable by males and therefore cadency marks had no relevance to daughters; in the modern era, Canadian and Irish heraldry include daughters in cadency. These differences are formed by adding to the arms small and inconspicuous marks called ''brisures'', similar to [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]]s but smaller. They are placed on the [[Fess|fess-point]], or [[chief (heraldry)|in-chief]] in the case of the label.<ref name=\"Britannica-11-p704\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 9th edition (1884), vol. 11, p. 704</ref> Brisures are generally exempt from the [[rule of tincture]]. One of the best examples of usage from the medieval period is shown on the seven Beauchamp cadets in the stained-glass windows of [[Collegiate_Church_of_St_Mary,_Warwick|St Mary's Church]], Warwick.<ref name=\"Britannica-11-p704\" />\n\n===Roll of arms===\n{{Main|Roll of arms}}\n[[File:Hyghalmen Roll Late 1400s.jpg|thumb|upright|The German ''[[Hyghalmen Roll]]'' was made in the late 15th century and illustrates the German practice of repeating themes from the arms in the crest. (See [[Roll of arms]]).]]\nA roll of arms (or armorial) is a collection of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], usually consisting of rows of painted pictures of shields, each shield accompanied by the name of the person bearing the arms.\n\nThe oldest extant armorials date to the mid 13th century, and armorial manuscripts continued to be produced throughout the [[Early Modern period]].\n''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' of 1605 was an early instance of a printed armorial. Medieval armorials usually include a few hundred coats of arms, in the late medieval period sometimes up to some 2,000. In the early modern period,  the larger armorials develop into encyclopedic projects, with the  ''Armorial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de France'' (1696), commissioned by [[Louis XIV of France]], listing more than 125,000 coats of arms. In the modern period, the tradition develops into projects of heraldic dictionaries edited in multiple volumes, such as the ''Dictionary of British Arms''  in four volumes (1926\u20132009), or ''J. Siebmacher's gro\u00dfes Wappenbuch'' in seven volumes (1854\u20131967).\n\nArmorials can be \"occasional\", relating to a specific event such as a tournament; \"institutional\", associated with foundations, such as that of an [[order of chivalry]], \"regional\", collecting the arms of the nobility of a given region, \"illustrative\", in the context of a specific narrative or chronicle, or \"general\", with the aim of an encyclopedic collection.<ref>''A New Dictionary of Heraldry'', 1987</ref>\nA roll of arms arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical [[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinaries]] and [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]]) grouped together as a tool to aid identification, is known as an [[ordinary of arms]] (or simply as an ordinary).\n\n===Armiger===\n{{Main|Armiger}}\nAn armiger is a person entitled to use a [[achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]] (e.g., bear arms, an \"armour-bearer\") either by hereditary right, grant, matriculation, or assumption of arms. Such a person is said to be ''armigerous''. A [[family]] or a [[clan]] likewise.\n\nThe Latin word ''armiger'' literally means \"arms-bearer\". In high and late medieval England, the word referred to an [[esquire]] attendant upon a [[knight]], but bearing his own unique armorial device. <ref>''Dictionary of Chivalry'', Uden. Kestrel Books, Harmondsworth, 1968. {{ISBN|0-7226-5372-7}}</ref>\n\n''Armiger'' was also used as a Latin [[cognomen]], and is now found as a rare surname in English-speaking countries.\n\nToday, the term ''armiger'' is well-defined only within jurisdictions, such as [[Canada]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where heraldry is regulated by the state or a heraldic body, such as the [[College of Arms]], the [[Chief Herald of Canada]], the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] or the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland]]. A person can be so entitled either by proven (and typically [[agnatic]]) descent from a person with a right to bear a [[heraldic achievement]], or by virtue of a grant of arms to himself. Merely sharing the same family name of an armiger is insufficient.\n\nMost of the time, the usage of a heraldic achievement is governed by legal restrictions; these restrictions are independent of the copyright status and independent of a coat of arms depiction. A coat of arms represents its owner. Though it can be freely represented, it cannot be appropriated, or used in such a way as to create a confusion with or a prejudice to its owner.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], titles of nobility are regulated by law but heraldry is not. In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] the nobility has had, since 1762, the prerogative to use an open helmet, while others use a closed helmet.\n\n==Devices==\nThis section describes the various '''heraldic devices''', also referred to as '''armory''' or '''armorial bearings''', that an armiger may be granted. This always includes an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], and may also include external devices, if posessed.\n\nThe term ('''coat of''') '''arms''' technically refers to the ([[blazon]] of the) escutcheon, but the phrase is commonly used to refer to the entire ('''armorial'''/'''heraldic''') '''achievement''' ('''of arms'''), i.e. full display of armorial devices.<ref>{{ Citation\n | last1=Boutell\n | first1=Charles \n | last2=Charles Fox-Davies\n | first2=Arthur \n | lastauthoramp=yes\n | title=The handbook to English heraldry\n | publisher=Reeves & Turner\n | place=\n | volume=\n | edition=\n | year=1914\n | quote=Achievement, or Achievement of Arms.

Many ancient armorial bearings consist of nothing else.\n\nThe word is used in two related senses. First, as the shield on which a [[coat of arms]] is displayed; second, a shield can itself be a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] within a coat of arms.\n\nEscutcheon shapes are derived from actual shields used by [[knight]]s in combat, and thus are varied and developed by region and by era. As this shape has been regarded as a war-like device appropriate to men only, British ladies customarily bear their arms upon a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]], or diamond-shape, while clergymen and ladies in continental Europe bear theirs on a [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]], or oval. Other shapes are in use, such as the [[roundel (heraldry)|roundel]] commonly used for arms granted to [[Aboriginal Canadians]] by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] or the [[Nguni shield]] used in [[Coats of arms and emblems of Africa|African heraldry]].\n\nThough it can be used as a charge on its own, the most common use of an escutcheon charge is to display another coat of arms as a form of [[Heraldry#Marshalling|marshalling]]. These escutcheons are usually given the same shape as the main shield. When there is only one such shield, it is sometimes called an ''inescutcheon''.\n\n===Externally, if possessed===\nFrom a very early date, illustrations of arms were frequently embellished with [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] placed above the shields.  These in turn came to be decorated with fan-shaped or sculptural crests, often incorporating elements from the shield of arms; as well as a wreath or [[torse]], or sometimes a [[coronet]], from which depended the lambrequin or [[mantling]]. To these elements, modern heraldry often adds a [[motto]] displayed on a ribbon, typically below the shield. The helmet is borne of right, and forms no part of a grant of arms; it may be assumed without authority by anyone entitled to bear arms, together with mantling and whatever motto the armiger may desire. The crest, however, together with the torse or coronet from which it arises, must be granted or confirmed by the relevant heraldic authority.<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\">{{harvp|Fox-Davies|1909|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\nIf the bearer is entitled to the ribbon, collar, or badge of a knightly order, it may encircle or depend from the shield. Some arms, particularly those of the nobility, are further embellished with supporters, heraldic figures standing alongside or behind the shield; often these stand on a [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]], typically a mound of earth and grass, on which other [[heraldic badge|badges]], symbols, or [[heraldic flag|heraldic banners]] may be displayed.  The most elaborate achievements sometimes display the entire coat of arms beneath a pavilion, an embellished tent or canopy of the type associated with the medieval tournament.,<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\"/> though this is only very rarely found in English or Scots achievements.\n\nTypes of accompanying, external devices are listed below.\n\n====Helm/crest/''galero''====\n{{Main|Helmet (heraldry)|Crest (heraldry)|Galero}}\n[[File:Cavalieredicasata.JPG|thumb|upright|A knight with an eagle crest at the [[Saracen Joust]] in [[Arezzo]], Tuscany.]]\nThe helmet or ''helm'' is situated above the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and bears the [[torse]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]. The style of helmet displayed varies according to [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|rank]] and [[social status]], and these styles developed over time, in step with the development of actual military [[Helmet|helmets]].<ref>[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 202.</ref><ref name=\"FD303\">[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], p. 303.</ref> In some traditions, especially [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German and Nordic heraldry]], two or three helmets (and sometimes more) may be used in a single [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement of arms]], each representing a [[fief]] to which the bearer has a right.  For this reason, the helmets and crests in German and Nordic arms are considered to be essential to the coat of arms and are never separated from it.\n\nOpen-visored or barred helmets are typically reserved to the highest ranks of nobility, while lesser nobility and [[burgher arms|burghers]] typically assume closed helms.<ref name=\"FD303\" /> While these classifications remained relatively constant, the specific forms of all these helmets varied and evolved over time.<ref name=\"FD303\" /> \n\nIn [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], bishops and other [[clergy]] use a [[mitre]] or other rank-appropriate ecclesiastical hat in place of a helmet.<ref>[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 75.</ref>\n\nIn [[English language|English]] the word \"crest\" is commonly (but erroneously) used to refer to an entire heraldic achievement of armorial bearings. The technical use of the heraldic term [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] refers to just one component of a complete achievement. The crest rests on top of a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] which itself rests on the most important part of the achievement: the shield.\n\nThe modern crest has grown out of the three-dimensional figure placed on the top of the mounted knights' helms as a further means of identification. In most heraldic traditions, a woman does not display a crest, though this tradition is being relaxed in some heraldic jurisdictions, and the stall plate of Lady Marion Fraser in the Thistle Chapel in St Giles, Edinburgh, shows her coat on a lozenge but with helmet, crest, and motto.\n\nThe crest is usually found on a [[torse|wreath]] of twisted cloth and sometimes within a [[coronet]]. Crest-coronets are generally simpler than coronets of rank, but several specialized forms exist; for example, in [[Canada]], descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s are entitled to use a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others).\n\nWhen the helm and crest are shown, they are usually accompanied by a [[mantling]]. This was originally a cloth worn over the back of the helmet as partial protection against heating by sunlight. Today it takes the form of a stylized cloak hanging from the helmet.<ref>{{harvp|Gwynn-Jones|1998|p=124}}</ref> Typically in British heraldry, the outer surface of the mantling is of the principal colour in the shield and the inner surface is of the principal metal, though peers in the United Kingdom use standard colourings (Gules doubled Argent \u2013 Red/White) regardless of rank or the colourings of their arms. The mantling is sometimes conventionally depicted with a ragged edge, as if damaged in combat, though the edges of most are simply decorated at the emblazoner's discretion.\n\nClergy often refrain from displaying a helm or crest in their [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|heraldic achievements]]. Members of the clergy may display appropriate headwear. This often takes the form of a small crowned, wide brimmed hat called a [[galero]] with the colours and tassels denoting rank; or, in the case of [[Papal coats of arms]] until the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005, an elaborate triple crown known as a [[tiara]]. Benedict broke with tradition to substitute a [[mitre]] in [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|his arms]]. Orthodox and Presbyterian clergy do sometimes adopt other forms of head gear to ensign their shields. In the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, clergy members may pass crests on to their offspring, but rarely display them on their own shields.\n\n====Mottoes and slogans====\n{{Main|Motto|Slogan (heraldry)}}\nAn armorial [[motto]] is a phrase or collection of words intended to describe the motivation or intention of the armigerous person or corporation. This can form a pun on the family name as in [[Thomas Nevile]]'s motto ''Ne vile velis''. Mottoes are generally changed at will and do not make up an integral part of the armorial achievement. Mottoes can typically be found on a scroll under the shield. In [[Scottish heraldry]], where the motto is granted as part of the [[blazon]], it is usually shown on a scroll above the crest, and may not be changed at will. A motto may be in any language.\n\n====Supporters====\n{{Main|Supporter}}\n[[File:App0084.jpg|thumb|upright|A lion supporting the [[Symbols of Brussels|arms of the City of Brussels]]]]\n[[Supporters]] are human or animal figures or, very rarely, inanimate objects, usually placed on either side of a coat of arms as though supporting it. In many traditions, these have acquired strict guidelines for use by certain social classes. On the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], there are often fewer restrictions on the use of supporters.<ref>{{harvp|Neubecker|1976|pp=186}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, only [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]], a few baronets, senior members of orders of knighthood, and some corporate bodies are granted supporters. Often, these can have local significance or a historical link to the armiger.\n\n====Crown/coronet====\n{{Main|Crown (heraldry)|Coronet}}\nIf the armiger has the title of [[baron]], hereditary [[knight]], or higher, he may display a coronet of rank above the shield. In the United Kingdom, this is shown between the shield and helmet, though it is often above the crest in Continental heraldry.\n\n====Order====\n{{Main|Order (distinction)}}\nAnother addition that can be made to a coat of arms is the insignia of a baronet or of an order of knighthood. This is usually represented by a collar or similar band surrounding the shield. When the arms of a knight and his wife are shown in one achievement, the insignia of knighthood surround the husband's arms only, and the wife's arms are customarily surrounded by an ornamental garland of leaves for visual balance.<ref>Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest''. (MacGibbon & Kee, London: 1960), 358.</ref>\n\n==== Banners ====\n{{Main|Heraldic flag|Banner of arms}}\n[[File:Banners of Knights of the Thistle.jpg|thumb|upright|Banners of [[Knights of the Thistle]] displayed in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]]]\n[[Flag]]s are used to identify ships (where they are called [[ensign]]s), embassies and such, and they use the same [[Tincture (heraldry)|colors]] and designs found in heraldry, but they are not usually considered to be heraldic. A country may have both a [[national flag]] and a national coat of arms, and the two may not look alike at all. For example, the [[flag of Scotland]] (St Andrew's Cross) has a white [[saltire]] on a blue [[field (heraldry)|field]], but the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms of Scotland]] has a red lion within a double [[wiktionary:tressure|tressure]] on a [[Or (heraldry)|gold (or)]] field.\n\n==== Compartment ====\n{{Main|Compartment (heraldry)}}\nA compartment is a design placed under the [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]], usually rocks, a grassy mount (''mount vert''), or some sort of other landscape upon which the [[supporters]] are depicted as standing.{{sfn|Woodcock|Robinson|1990|p=106}} Care must be taken to distinguish true compartments from items upon which supporters are merely resting one or more feet, or, sometimes, mere heraldic badges or pure decoration under the shield, and, conversely, care must also be taken in very unusual cases such as the [[coat of arms of Belize]], in which what may be taken to be a crest, the mahogany tree rising above the shield, is really part of the compartment.  It is sometimes said to represent the land held by the bearer.  As an official part of the blazon it is a comparatively late feature of heraldry, often derived from the need to have different supporters for different families or entities, although sometimes the compartment is treated in the [[blazon]] separately from the supporters.\n\n====Mantling====\n{{Main|Mantling}}\nMantling or \"lambrequin\" (its name in French) is drapery tied to the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] above the shield. In paper heraldry it is a depiction of the protective cloth covering (often of [[linen]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=8827 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] \u2013 Mantling</ref>) worn by [[knight]]s from their helmets to stave off the elements, and, secondarily, to decrease the effects of sword-blows against the helmet in battle, from which it is usually shown tattered or cut to shreds; less often it is shown as an intact drape, principally in those cases where clergy use a helmet and mantling (to symbolise that, despite the perhaps contradictory presence of the helmet, they have not been involved in combat), although this is usually the artist's discretion and done for decorative rather than symbolic reasons.\n\nGenerally, mantling is blazoned ''mantled x, doubled'' [lined] ''y''; the cloth has two sides, one of a [[Tincture_(heraldry)#Colours|colour]] and the other of a [[Tincture_(heraldry)#Metals|metal]]. The mantling is usually in the main colours of the shield, or else in the [[livery]] colours that symbolize the entity bearing the arms, though there are exceptions, with occasional tinctures differing from these, or occasional examples in which the outside of the mantling is per pale of two colours<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20158.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011659/http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20158.gif |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> or both the inside and outside are per pale,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetijelkepek.hu/onkormanyzat-ocsod_en.shtml|title=National and historical symbols of Hungary|first=National Infocommunications Service Company Limited by|last=Shares|date=|website=www.nemzetijelkepek.hu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> and even rarer examples of other divisions,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sitio oficial de Sutamarchan en Boyaca, Colombia|url=http://sutamarchan-boyaca.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=m-g1--&m=f|accessdate=2007-10-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714163157/http://sutamarchan-boyaca.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=m-g1--&m=f|archivedate=2012-07-14}}</ref> and there is a perhaps unique example in which the lining of the mantling is per pale of the two metals<ref>{{cite web|title=College of Arms: The Arms and Badge of Professor S.

It still holds true frequently in [[Germany]].\n\nThere are rare examples where the mantling is blazoned to complement the armiger's coat of arms, mimicking the ordinaries and charges on the escutcheon. When charges occur, they are usually displayed as a [[semy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20149.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011708/http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20149.gif |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref>\n\n====Mantle and pavilion====\n{{Main|Mantle and pavilion (heraldry)}}\n[[File:Kongev\u00e5pen 1905 copy.jpg|thumb|1905 painting of the greater [[Coat of arms of Norway|royal coat of arms of Norway]], which includes the [[Order of St. Olav]] and a mantle]]\nA mantle is a symbol of sovereign power and is generally reserved for royalty.

However, there have been other historical cultures which have used symbols and emblems to represent families or individuals, and in some cases these symbols have been adopted into Western heraldry. For example, the [[coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire]] incorporated the royal [[tughra]] as part of its [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], along with such traditional Western heraldic elements as the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]].\n\n====Greek symbols====\nAncient Greeks were among the first civilizations to use symbols consistently in order to identify a warrior, clan or a state.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The first record of a shield blazon is illustrated in [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''.\n\n====Mon====\n{{Main|Mon (emblem)}}\n{{nihongo|'''Mon'''|\u7d0b|}}, also {{nihongo|'''monsh\u014d'''|\u7d0b\u7ae0|}}, {{nihongo|'''mondokoro'''|\u7d0b\u6240|}}, and {{nihongo|'''kamon'''|\u5bb6\u7d0b|}}, are [[Japan]]ese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual or family. While ''mon'' is an encompassing term that may refer to any such device, ''kamon'' and ''mondokoro'' refer specifically to emblems used to identify a family.{{Elucidate|reason=This is the same as previously stated, so what is the difference with mon and monsh\u014d? |date=February 2016}} An authoritative ''mon'' reference compiles Japan's 241 general categories of ''mon'' based on structural resemblance (a single ''mon'' may belong to multiple categories), with 5116 distinct individual ''mon'' (it is however well acknowledged that there exist lost or obscure ''mon'' that are not in this compilation).<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u5bb6\u7d0b\u5927\u5168 |publisher={{lang|ja|\u68a7\u6850\u66f8\u9662}} |year=2004 |ISBN=434003102X}}</ref><ref>Some 6939 ''mon'' are [https://x181.secure.ne.jp/~x181007/kamon/goodslist.cgi listed here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028043638/http://x181.secure.ne.jp/~x181007/kamon/goodslist.cgi |date=2016-10-28 }}.</ref>\n\nThe devices are similar to the [[Heraldic badge|badges]] and [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] in European heraldic tradition, which likewise are used to identify individuals and families.  ''Mon'' are often referred to as [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]] in Western literature, another European heraldic device similar to the ''mon'' in function.\n\n====Socialist heraldry====\n{{Main|Socialist heraldry}}\n'''Socialist heraldry''', also called '''communist heraldry''', consists of emblems in a style typically adopted by [[communist state]]s and characterized by [[communist symbolism]]. Although commonly called ''[[coat of arms|coats of arms]]'', most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional heraldic sense and should therefore, in a strict sense, not be called arms at all.<ref name=\"von Volborth\">{{harvp|von Volborth|1981|page= 11}}</ref> Many communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of [[European heraldry]] in order to distance themselves from the [[monarchy|monarchies]] that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] was the first state to use socialist heraldry, beginning at its creation in 1922. The style became more widespread after [[World War II]], when many other communist states were established. Even a few non-socialist states have adopted the style, for various reasons\u2014usually because [[Wars of national liberation|communists had helped them to gain independence]]\u2014but also when no apparent connection to a Communist nation exists, such as the [[emblem of Italy]].<ref name=\"von Volborth\"/><ref name=\"von Volborth 1972\">{{cite book |last= von Volborth|first= Carl-Alexander|author-link1= Carl-Alexander von Volborth| date= 1972 | title= Alverdens heraldik i farver | language=Danish | others=Editor and translator from English to Danish: [[Sven Tito Achen]] | location= Copenhagen | publisher=Politikens Forlag |page= 158|isbn= 87 567 1685 0}}</ref> After the fall of the Soviet Union and the other communist states in Eastern Europe in 1989\u20131991, this style of heraldry was often abandoned for the old heraldic practices, with many (but not all) of the new governments reinstating the traditional heraldry that was previously cast aside.\n\n====Tamgas====\n{{Main|Tamga}}\nA '''tamga''' or '''tamgha''' \"stamp, seal\" ({{lang-mn|\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0433\u0430}}, [[turkic languages|Turkic:]] tamga) is an abstract [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] or [[Seal (emblem)|stamp]] used by [[Eurasian nomad]]ic peoples and by cultures influenced by them. The tamga was normally the emblem of a particular tribe, clan or family. They were common among the Eurasian nomads throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages (including [[Alans]], [[Mongols]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Turkic peoples]]). Similar \"tamga-like\" symbols were sometimes also adopted by sedentary peoples adjacent to the Pontic-Caspian steppe both in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]],<ref>Ottfried Neubecker. ''Heraldik''. Orbis, 2002; Brook 154; Franklin and Shepard 120\u2013121; Pritsak 78\u201379.</ref> such as the [[East Slavs]], whose ancient [[Symbols of the Rurikids|royal symbols]] are sometimes referred to as \"tamgas\" and have similar appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMwmcqwZUGcC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=rurikid+tamga&source=bl&ots=OZoyQCrJDu&sig=2nASSscIJn6WshI6ORaX5PoWiuI&hl=ru&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6ifi2sqPNAhXkNJoKHYB7DrEQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&q=rurikid%20tamga&f=false|title = Pre-modern Russia and Its World: Essays in Honor of Thomas S.

One could also adopt the tamga of one's master or ruler, therefore signifying said master's patronage. Outside of denoting ownership, tamgas also possessed religious significance, and were used as [[talisman]]s to protect one from curses (it was believed that, as symbols of family, tamgas embodied the power of one's heritage). Tamgas depicted geometric shapes, images of animals, items, or [[glyph]]s. As they were usually inscribed using heavy and unwieldy instruments, such as knives or brands, and on different surfaces (meaning that their appearance could vary somewhat), tamgas were always simple and stylised, and needed to be laconic and easily recognisable.<ref>\u0422\u0410\u041c\u0413\u0410 (\u043a \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0430). \u0412.\u0421. \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0445, No 7, \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0440, 2001, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 75\u201386)</ref>\n\n====Tughras====\n{{Main|Tughra}}\n{{Further|Coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire}}\nEvery sultan of the Ottoman Empire had his own monogram, called the tughra, which served as a royal symbol. A coat of arms in the European heraldic sense was created in the late 19th century. Hampton Court requested from Ottoman Empire the coat of arms to be included in their collection. As the coat of arms had not been previously used in Ottoman Empire, it was designed after this request and the final design was adopted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II on April 17, 1882. It included two flags: the flag of the Ottoman Dynasty, which had a crescent and a star on red base, and the flag of the Islamic Caliph, which had three crescents on a green base.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book|ref=harv |last=Pimbley |first=Arthur Francis |year=1908 |title=Pimbley's dictionary of heraldry |publisher=Pimbley|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry}}\n* {{cite web\n| accessdate = 2011-05-16\n| publisher = An Tir College of Heralds\n| title = What is an Achievement?\n| quote = An 'achievement' is a full formal display of a coat of arms.\n| url = http://www.antirheralds.org/display/achievements/achievements.html\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110420025929/http://antirheralds.org/display/achievements/achievements.html\n| archivedate = 20 April 2011\n| url-status = dead\n| df = dmy-all\n}}\n\n; Books\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |author-link=Charles Boutell |last=Boutell |first=Charles |year=1890 |url = https://archive.org/details/heraldryancientm00boutrich |editor-first=S.

These five devices ([[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], [[tabard]], [[caparison]], [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]]/[[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] and [[Banner of arms|banner]]) are decorated with the same [[blazon]] ([[Charge (heraldry)|charges]]).]]\n\nHeraldry was developed in the European [[High Middle Ages]],<ref name=\"CGH 1\u201318\"/> closely associated with the [[Royal court|courtly]] culture of [[chivalry]], [[Latin Church|Latin Christianity]], the [[Crusades]], [[feudalism|feudal]] [[nobility|aristocracy]], and [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchy]] of the time. Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]]. Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages ([[Burgher arms]]). Specific traditions of [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] also develop in the late medieval period. Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to [[municipal coats of arms]] by the 16th century.\n\nWestern heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nWith the decline of European monarchies in favour of [[Republicanism]] in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern [[national flag]]s and [[national emblem]]s adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition.\n\n==Current practice==\n[[File:1952 Trygve Lie Resigns.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Escutcheons]] in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] hall, on which the national arms were to be rendered<ref>https://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/704/0070477.html</ref>]]\nHeraldry flourishes in the modern world; institutions, companies, and private persons continue using coats of arms as their pictorial identification. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the English [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]], Scotland's [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], and the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland|Chief Herald of Ireland]] continue making grants of arms.<ref>See the [http://college-of-arms.gov.uk/#newsletter College of Arms newsletter] for quarterly samplings of English grants and the [http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm Chief Herald of Ireland's webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004045906/http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm |date=2006-10-04 }} for recent Irish grants.</ref> There are heraldic authorities in [[Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|Canada]],<ref>See the [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/main.asp?lang=e Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada].</ref> South Africa, Spain, and Sweden that grant or register coats of arms. In [[South African heraldry|South Africa]], the right to armorial bearings is also determined by [[Roman Dutch law]], due to its origins as a 17th-century colony of the Netherlands.<ref>Cornelius Pama. ''Heraldry of South African families: coats of arms/crests/ancestry.'' (Balkema, Cape Town: 1972)</ref>\n\nHeraldic societies abound in Africa, Asia, Australasia, the Americas and Europe. Heraldry aficionados participate in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], medieval revivals, [[micronation]]s and other related projects. Modern armigers use heraldry to express ancestral and personal heritage as well as professional, academic, civic, and national pride. Little is left of class identification in modern heraldry, where the emphasis is more than ever on expression of identity.<ref>{{harvp|Slater|2003|p=238}}</ref>\n\nHeraldry continues to build on its rich tradition in [[academia]], [[government]], guilds and [[professional associations]], religious institutions, and the military. Nations and their subdivisions &ndash; provinces, states, counties, cities, etc. &ndash; continue to build on the traditions of civic heraldry. The [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, and other religious institutions maintain the traditions of [[ecclesiastical heraldry]] for clergy, religious orders, and schools.\n\nMany of these institutions have begun to employ blazons representing modern objects unknown in the medieval world. For example, some heraldic symbols issued by the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] incorporate symbols such as guns, airplanes, or locomotives. Some scientific institutions incorporate symbols of modern science such as the [[Symbol (chemistry)|atom]] or particular scientific instruments. The arms of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] uses traditional heraldic symbols to depict the harnessing of atomic power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=CUdMRj7qOr8C&pg=PA21&dq=atom+symbol+in+heraldry&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihiN2D48XTAhVB_IMKHa4CClwQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&q=atom%20symbol%20in%20heraldry&f=false|title=Heraldic Design: A Handbook for Students|last=Child|first=Heather|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=9780806300719|language=en}}</ref> Locations with strong associations to particular industries may incorporate associated symbols. The coat of arms of [[Stenungsund Municipality]] in Sweden, pictured right, incorporates a hydrocarbon molecule, alluding to the historical significance of the petrochemical industry in the region.\n\nHeraldry in countries with heraldic authorities continues to be regulated generally by [[Law of heraldic arms|laws]] granting rights to arms and recognizing possession of arms as well as protecting against their misuse. Countries without heraldic authorities usually treat coats of arms as creative property in the manner of [[logo]]s, offering protection under [[copyright law]]s. This is the case in [[Nigerian heraldry|Nigeria]], where most of the components of its heraldic system are otherwise unregulated.\n\nAmong the states ruled by communist regimes, emblems [[Socialist heraldry|resembling the Soviet design]] were adopted in all the [[Warsaw Pact]] states except [[Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and Poland and [[Karelia]]. Since 1989, some of the ex-[[Communist state]]s, as [[Coat of arms of Romania|Romania]] or [[Coat of arms of Russia|Russia]] have reused their original pre-communist heraldry, often with only the symbols of monarchy removed. Other countries such as [[National emblem of Belarus|Belarus]] and [[Emblem of Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] have retained their communist coats of arms or at least kept some of the old heraldry.\n\nWith the independence of the modern nation states of the [[Arab World]] from the First World War onwards, European traditions of heraldry were partially adopted for state emblems. These emblems often involve the [[star and crescent]] symbol taken from the [[Ottoman flag]].\nOther commonly seen symbols are birds, chiefly the [[Eagle of Saladin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/egyptianstudies/2011/05/04/coat-of-arms/|title=Coat of Arms (Eagle of Saladin)|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2015|publisher=Macaulay Honors College}}</ref> and the [[Hawk of Quraish]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} These symbols can be found on the [[Coat of Arms of Egypt]], and [[Coat of Arms of Syria|Syria]], amongst others.\n\n[[Coats of arms and emblems of Africa|Sub-Saharan African flags and emblems]] after [[decolonisation]] often chose emblems based on regional traditions or wildlife. Symbols of a ritual significance according to local custom were generally favoured, such as the [[leopard]] in the arms of [[Benin]], [[Malawi]], [[Somalia]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and, in the form of the black panther, of [[Gabon]].\n\nIn [[Kenya]], the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word [[Harambee]] (lit. \"Let us come together\") is used as a motto in the country's coat of arms. In [[Botswana]] and [[Lesotho]], meanwhile, the word [[Botswana Pula|Pula]] (lit. \"Rain\") is used in like fashion.\n\nIn the coat of arms of [[Swaziland]], a [[lion]] and an [[elephant]] serve as supporters. They are each intended to represent the king and the queen mother respectively, the nation's joint heads of state.\n\n===Variations===\n==== Depending on category of armiger ====\n* [[National coat of arms|National]]\n** [[Arms of dominion|Dominion]]\n** [[Civic heraldry|Civic]]\n* [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|Ecclesiastical]]\n** [[Papal armorial|Papal]]\n* [[Burgher arms|Burgher]]\n* [[Women in heraldry|Female]]\n* [[Attributed arms|Attributed]]\n*[[Arms of alliance|Alliance]]\n*[[Heraldic courtesy|Courtesy]]\n*[[Naval heraldry|Naval]]\n*[[Jewish heraldry|Jewish]]\n\n====Depending on geography====\n{{Main|National heraldic styles}}\nThe emergence of heraldry occurred across [[western Europe]] almost simultaneously in the various countries. Originally, heraldic style was very similar from country to country.<ref>Davies, T. R. (Spring 1976). \"Did National Heraldry Exist?\". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''NS II''' (97): 16.</ref> Over time, heraldic tradition diverged into four broad styles: German-Nordic, Gallo-British, Latin, and Eastern.<ref>{{harvp|von Warnstedt|1970|p=128}}</ref> In addition it can be argued that newer national heraldic traditions, such as [[South Africa]]n and Canadian, have emerged in the 20th century.<ref>Alan Beddoe, revised by Strome Galloway. ''Beddoe's Canadian Heraldry''. (Mika Publishing Company, Belleville: 1981).</ref>\n\n==General concepts==\nThese general concepts apply for armorial bearings and, in practice to a lesser extent, [[vexillology]].\n\n===Blazon===\n{{Main|Blazon}}\nTo \"blazon\" arms means to describe them using the formal language of heraldry. This language has its own vocabulary and [[syntax]], or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. The verb comes from the [[Middle English]] ''blasoun'', itself a derivative of the French ''blason'' meaning \"shield\". The system of [[blazon]]ing arms used in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries today was developed by heraldic officers in the [[Middle Ages]]. The blazon includes a description of the arms contained within the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] or shield, the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] where present, [[motto]] and other insignia. Complex rules, such as the [[rule of tincture]], apply to the physical and artistic form of newly created arms, and a thorough understanding of these rules is essential to the art of heraldry. Though heraldic forms initially were broadly similar across Europe, several national styles had developed by the end of the [[Middle Ages]], and artistic and blazoning styles today range from the very simple to extraordinarily complex.\n\nThe [[blazon]] is the formal description of the escutcheon, and may also be extended to describe the other devices in the achievement. The blazon of the escutcheon may traditionally also be used to decorate [[Banner of arms|banners]], [[Mantle and pavilion (heraldry)|mantles]], garments ([[surcoat]]s, [[tabard]]s, [[robe]]s and [[caparison]]s), furniture and structural elements.\n\n===Tinctures===\n{{Main|Tincture (heraldry)}}\n[[File:Heraldic tincture.jpg|thumb|Coloured and monochrome [[Hatching (heraldry)|hatched]] version of heraldic devices]]\nOne of the most distinctive qualities of heraldry is the use of a limited palette of colours and patterns, usually referred to as [[tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]].  These are divided into three categories, known as ''metals'', ''colours'', and ''furs''.{{efn-lr|Technically, the word ''tincture'' applies specifically to the colours, rather than to the metals or the furs; but for lack of another term including all three, it is regularly used in this extended sense.}}<ref>{{harvp|Fox-Davies|1909|p=70}}</ref>\n\n{{Tinctures}}\n\n===Differencing and cadency===\n{{Main|Cadency}}\nCadency is any systematic way to distinguish [[Coat of arms|arms]] displayed by [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s of the holder of a [[coat of arms]] when those family members have not been granted arms in their own right.  Cadency is necessary in heraldic systems in which a given design may be owned by only one person at any time, generally the head of the senior line of a particular family.  As an [[armiger]]'s arms may be used 'by courtesy', either by children or spouses, while they are still living, some form of differencing may be required so as not to confuse them with the original ''undifferenced'' or \"plain coat\" arms. Historically, arms were only heritable by males and therefore cadency marks had no relevance to daughters; in the modern era, Canadian and Irish heraldry include daughters in cadency. These differences are formed by adding to the arms small and inconspicuous marks called ''brisures'', similar to [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]]s but smaller. They are placed on the [[Fess|fess-point]], or [[chief (heraldry)|in-chief]] in the case of the label.<ref name=\"Britannica-11-p704\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 9th edition (1884), vol. 11, p. 704</ref> Brisures are generally exempt from the [[rule of tincture]]. One of the best examples of usage from the medieval period is shown on the seven Beauchamp cadets in the stained-glass windows of [[Collegiate_Church_of_St_Mary,_Warwick|St Mary's Church]], Warwick.<ref name=\"Britannica-11-p704\" />\n\n===Roll of arms===\n{{Main|Roll of arms}}\n[[File:Hyghalmen Roll Late 1400s.jpg|thumb|upright|The German ''[[Hyghalmen Roll]]'' was made in the late 15th century and illustrates the German practice of repeating themes from the arms in the crest. (See [[Roll of arms]]).]]\nA roll of arms (or armorial) is a collection of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], usually consisting of rows of painted pictures of shields, each shield accompanied by the name of the person bearing the arms.\n\nThe oldest extant armorials date to the mid 13th century, and armorial manuscripts continued to be produced throughout the [[Early Modern period]].\n''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' of 1605 was an early instance of a printed armorial. Medieval armorials usually include a few hundred coats of arms, in the late medieval period sometimes up to some 2,000. In the early modern period,  the larger armorials develop into encyclopedic projects, with the  ''Armorial g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de France'' (1696), commissioned by [[Louis XIV of France]], listing more than 125,000 coats of arms. In the modern period, the tradition develops into projects of heraldic dictionaries edited in multiple volumes, such as the ''Dictionary of British Arms''  in four volumes (1926&ndash;2009), or ''J. Siebmacher's gro\u00dfes Wappenbuch'' in seven volumes (1854&ndash;1967).\n\nArmorials can be \"occasional\", relating to a specific event such as a tournament; \"institutional\", associated with foundations, such as that of an [[order of chivalry]], \"regional\", collecting the arms of the nobility of a given region, \"illustrative\", in the context of a specific narrative or chronicle, or \"general\", with the aim of an encyclopedic collection.<ref>''A New Dictionary of Heraldry'', 1987</ref>\nA roll of arms arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical [[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinaries]] and [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]]) grouped together as a tool to aid identification, is known as an [[ordinary of arms]] (or simply as an ordinary).\n\n===Armiger===\n{{Main|Armiger}}\nAn armiger is a person entitled to use a [[achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]] (e.g., bear arms, an \"armour-bearer\") either by hereditary right, grant, matriculation, or assumption of arms. Such a person is said to be ''armigerous''. A [[family]] or a [[clan]] likewise.\n\nThe Latin word ''armiger'' literally means \"arms-bearer\". In high and late medieval England, the word referred to an [[esquire]] attendant upon a [[knight]], but bearing his own unique armorial device. <ref>''Dictionary of Chivalry'', Uden. Kestrel Books, Harmondsworth, 1968. {{ISBN|0-7226-5372-7}}</ref>\n\n''Armiger'' was also used as a Latin [[cognomen]], and is now found as a rare surname in English-speaking countries.\n\nToday, the term ''armiger'' is well-defined only within jurisdictions, such as [[Canada]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where heraldry is regulated by the state or a heraldic body, such as the [[College of Arms]], the [[Chief Herald of Canada]], the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] or the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland]]. A person can be so entitled either by proven (and typically [[agnatic]]) descent from a person with a right to bear a [[heraldic achievement]], or by virtue of a grant of arms to himself. Merely sharing the same family name of an armiger is insufficient.\n\nMost of the time, the usage of a heraldic achievement is governed by legal restrictions; these restrictions are independent of the copyright status and independent of a coat of arms depiction. A coat of arms represents its owner. Though it can be freely represented, it cannot be appropriated, or used in such a way as to create a confusion with or a prejudice to its owner.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], titles of nobility are regulated by law but heraldry is not. In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] the nobility has had, since 1762, the prerogative to use an open helmet, while others use a closed helmet.\n\n==Devices==\nThis section describes the various '''heraldic devices''', also referred to as '''armory''' or '''armorial bearings''', that an armiger may be granted. This always includes an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], and may also include external devices, if posessed.\n\nThe term ('''coat of''') '''arms''' technically refers to the ([[blazon]] of the) escutcheon, but the phrase is commonly used to refer to the entire ('''armorial'''/'''heraldic''') '''achievement''' ('''of arms'''), i.e. full display of armorial devices.<ref>{{ Citation\n | last1=Boutell\n | first1=Charles \n | last2=Charles Fox-Davies\n | first2=Arthur \n | lastauthoramp=yes\n | title=The handbook to English heraldry\n | publisher=Reeves & Turner\n | place=\n | volume=\n | edition=\n | year=1914\n | quote=Achievement, or Achievement of Arms.

Many ancient armorial bearings consist of nothing else.\n\nThe word is used in two related senses. First, as the shield on which a [[coat of arms]] is displayed; second, a shield can itself be a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] within a coat of arms.\n\nEscutcheon shapes are derived from actual shields used by [[knight]]s in combat, and thus are varied and developed by region and by era. As this shape has been regarded as a war-like device appropriate to men only, British ladies customarily bear their arms upon a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]], or diamond-shape, while clergymen and ladies in continental Europe bear theirs on a [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]], or oval. Other shapes are in use, such as the [[roundel (heraldry)|roundel]] commonly used for arms granted to [[Aboriginal Canadians]] by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] or the [[Nguni shield]] used in [[Coats of arms and emblems of Africa|African heraldry]].\n\nThough it can be used as a charge on its own, the most common use of an escutcheon charge is to display another coat of arms as a form of [[Heraldry#Marshalling|marshalling]]. These escutcheons are usually given the same shape as the main shield. When there is only one such shield, it is sometimes called an ''inescutcheon''.\n\n===Externally, if possessed===\nFrom a very early date, illustrations of arms were frequently embellished with [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] placed above the shields.  These in turn came to be decorated with fan-shaped or sculptural crests, often incorporating elements from the shield of arms; as well as a wreath or [[torse]], or sometimes a [[coronet]], from which depended the lambrequin or [[mantling]]. To these elements, modern heraldry often adds a [[motto]] displayed on a ribbon, typically below the shield. The helmet is borne of right, and forms no part of a grant of arms; it may be assumed without authority by anyone entitled to bear arms, together with mantling and whatever motto the armiger may desire. The crest, however, together with the torse or coronet from which it arises, must be granted or confirmed by the relevant heraldic authority.<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\">{{harvp|Fox-Davies|1909|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\nIf the bearer is entitled to the ribbon, collar, or badge of a knightly order, it may encircle or depend from the shield. Some arms, particularly those of the nobility, are further embellished with supporters, heraldic figures standing alongside or behind the shield; often these stand on a [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]], typically a mound of earth and grass, on which other [[heraldic badge|badges]], symbols, or [[heraldic flag|heraldic banners]] may be displayed.  The most elaborate achievements sometimes display the entire coat of arms beneath a pavilion, an embellished tent or canopy of the type associated with the medieval tournament.,<ref name=\"CGH 57\u201359\"/> though this is only very rarely found in English or Scots achievements.\n\nTypes of accompanying, external devices are listed below.\n\n====Helm/crest/''galero''====\n{{Main|Helmet (heraldry)|Crest (heraldry)|Galero}}\n[[File:Cavalieredicasata.JPG|thumb|upright|A knight with an eagle crest at the [[Saracen Joust]] in [[Arezzo]], Tuscany.]]\nThe helmet or ''helm'' is situated above the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and bears the [[torse]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]. The style of helmet displayed varies according to [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|rank]] and [[social status]], and these styles developed over time, in step with the development of actual military [[Helmet|helmets]].<ref>[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 202.</ref><ref name=\"FD303\">[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], p. 303.</ref> In some traditions, especially [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German and Nordic heraldry]], two or three helmets (and sometimes more) may be used in a single [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement of arms]], each representing a [[fief]] to which the bearer has a right.  For this reason, the helmets and crests in German and Nordic arms are considered to be essential to the coat of arms and are never separated from it.\n\nOpen-visored or barred helmets are typically reserved to the highest ranks of nobility, while lesser nobility and [[burgher arms|burghers]] typically assume closed helms.<ref name=\"FD303\" /> While these classifications remained relatively constant, the specific forms of all these helmets varied and evolved over time.<ref name=\"FD303\" /> \n\nIn [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], bishops and other [[clergy]] use a [[mitre]] or other rank-appropriate ecclesiastical hat in place of a helmet.<ref>[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 75.</ref>\n\nIn [[English language|English]] the word \"crest\" is commonly (but erroneously) used to refer to an entire heraldic achievement of armorial bearings. The technical use of the heraldic term [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] refers to just one component of a complete achievement. The crest rests on top of a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] which itself rests on the most important part of the achievement: the shield.\n\nThe modern crest has grown out of the three-dimensional figure placed on the top of the mounted knights' helms as a further means of identification. In most heraldic traditions, a woman does not display a crest, though this tradition is being relaxed in some heraldic jurisdictions, and the stall plate of Lady Marion Fraser in the Thistle Chapel in St Giles, Edinburgh, shows her coat on a lozenge but with helmet, crest, and motto.\n\nThe crest is usually found on a [[torse|wreath]] of twisted cloth and sometimes within a [[coronet]]. Crest-coronets are generally simpler than coronets of rank, but several specialized forms exist; for example, in [[Canada]], descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s are entitled to use a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others).\n\nWhen the helm and crest are shown, they are usually accompanied by a [[mantling]]. This was originally a cloth worn over the back of the helmet as partial protection against heating by sunlight. Today it takes the form of a stylized cloak hanging from the helmet.<ref>{{harvp|Gwynn-Jones|1998|p=124}}</ref> Typically in British heraldry, the outer surface of the mantling is of the principal colour in the shield and the inner surface is of the principal metal, though peers in the United Kingdom use standard colourings (Gules doubled Argent - Red/White) regardless of rank or the colourings of their arms. The mantling is sometimes conventionally depicted with a ragged edge, as if damaged in combat, though the edges of most are simply decorated at the emblazoner's discretion.\n\nClergy often refrain from displaying a helm or crest in their [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|heraldic achievements]]. Members of the clergy may display appropriate headwear. This often takes the form of a small crowned, wide brimmed hat called a [[galero]] with the colours and tassels denoting rank; or, in the case of [[Papal coats of arms]] until the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005, an elaborate triple crown known as a [[tiara]]. Benedict broke with tradition to substitute a [[mitre]] in [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|his arms]]. Orthodox and Presbyterian clergy do sometimes adopt other forms of head gear to ensign their shields. In the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, clergy members may pass crests on to their offspring, but rarely display them on their own shields.\n\n====Mottoes and slogans====\n{{Main|Motto|Slogan (heraldry)}}\nAn armorial [[motto]] is a phrase or collection of words intended to describe the motivation or intention of the armigerous person or corporation. This can form a pun on the family name as in [[Thomas Nevile]]'s motto ''Ne vile velis''. Mottoes are generally changed at will and do not make up an integral part of the armorial achievement. Mottoes can typically be found on a scroll under the shield. In [[Scottish heraldry]], where the motto is granted as part of the [[blazon]], it is usually shown on a scroll above the crest, and may not be changed at will. A motto may be in any language.\n\n====Supporters====\n{{Main|Supporter}}\n[[File:App0084.jpg|thumb|upright|A lion supporting the [[Symbols of Brussels|arms of the City of Brussels]]]]\n[[Supporters]] are human or animal figures or, very rarely, inanimate objects, usually placed on either side of a coat of arms as though supporting it. In many traditions, these have acquired strict guidelines for use by certain social classes. On the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], there are often fewer restrictions on the use of supporters.<ref>{{harvp|Neubecker|1976|pp=186}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, only [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]], a few baronets, senior members of orders of knighthood, and some corporate bodies are granted supporters. Often, these can have local significance or a historical link to the armiger.\n\n====Crown/coronet====\n{{Main|Crown (heraldry)|Coronet}}\nIf the armiger has the title of [[baron]], hereditary [[knight]], or higher, he may display a coronet of rank above the shield. In the United Kingdom, this is shown between the shield and helmet, though it is often above the crest in Continental heraldry.\n\n====Order====\n{{Main|Order (distinction)}}\nAnother addition that can be made to a coat of arms is the insignia of a baronet or of an order of knighthood. This is usually represented by a collar or similar band surrounding the shield. When the arms of a knight and his wife are shown in one achievement, the insignia of knighthood surround the husband's arms only, and the wife's arms are customarily surrounded by an ornamental garland of leaves for visual balance.<ref>Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest''. (MacGibbon & Kee, London: 1960), 358.</ref>\n\n==== Banners ====\n{{Main|Heraldic flag|Banner of arms}}\n[[File:Banners of Knights of the Thistle.jpg|thumb|upright|Banners of [[Knights of the Thistle]] displayed in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]]]\n[[Flag]]s are used to identify ships (where they are called [[ensign]]s), embassies and such, and they use the same [[Tincture (heraldry)|colors]] and designs found in heraldry, but they are not usually considered to be heraldic. A country may have both a [[national flag]] and a national coat of arms, and the two may not look alike at all. For example, the [[flag of Scotland]] (St Andrew's Cross) has a white [[saltire]] on a blue [[field (heraldry)|field]], but the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|royal arms of Scotland]] has a red lion within a double [[wiktionary:tressure|tressure]] on a [[Or (heraldry)|gold (or)]] field.\n\n==== Compartment ====\n{{Main|Compartment (heraldry)}}\nA compartment is a design placed under the [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]], usually rocks, a grassy mount (''mount vert''), or some sort of other landscape upon which the [[supporters]] are depicted as standing.{{sfn|Woodcock|Robinson|1990|p=106}} Care must be taken to distinguish true compartments from items upon which supporters are merely resting one or more feet, or, sometimes, mere heraldic badges or pure decoration under the shield, and, conversely, care must also be taken in very unusual cases such as the [[coat of arms of Belize]], in which what may be taken to be a crest, the mahogany tree rising above the shield, is really part of the compartment.  It is sometimes said to represent the land held by the bearer.  As an official part of the blazon it is a comparatively late feature of heraldry, often derived from the need to have different supporters for different families or entities, although sometimes the compartment is treated in the [[blazon]] separately from the supporters.\n\n====Mantling====\n{{Main|Mantling}}\nMantling or \"lambrequin\" (its name in French) is drapery tied to the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] above the shield. In paper heraldry it is a depiction of the protective cloth covering (often of [[linen]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=8827 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] - Mantling</ref>) worn by [[knight]]s from their helmets to stave off the elements, and, secondarily, to decrease the effects of sword-blows against the helmet in battle, from which it is usually shown tattered or cut to shreds; less often it is shown as an intact drape, principally in those cases where clergy use a helmet and mantling (to symbolise that, despite the perhaps contradictory presence of the helmet, they have not been involved in combat), although this is usually the artist's discretion and done for decorative rather than symbolic reasons.\n\nGenerally, mantling is blazoned ''mantled x, doubled'' [lined] ''y''; the cloth has two sides, one of a [[Tincture_(heraldry)#Colours|colour]] and the other of a [[Tincture_(heraldry)#Metals|metal]]. The mantling is usually in the main colours of the shield, or else in the [[livery]] colours that symbolize the entity bearing the arms, though there are exceptions, with occasional tinctures differing from these, or occasional examples in which the outside of the mantling is per pale of two colours<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20158.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011659/http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20158.gif |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> or both the inside and outside are per pale,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetijelkepek.hu/onkormanyzat-ocsod_en.shtml|title=National and historical symbols of Hungary|first=National Infocommunications Service Company Limited by|last=Shares|date=|website=www.nemzetijelkepek.hu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> and even rarer examples of other divisions,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sitio oficial de Sutamarchan en Boyaca, Colombia|url=http://sutamarchan-boyaca.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=m-g1--&m=f|accessdate=2007-10-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714163157/http://sutamarchan-boyaca.gov.co/nuestromunicipio.shtml?apc=m-g1--&m=f|archivedate=2012-07-14}}</ref> and there is a perhaps unique example in which the lining of the mantling is per pale of the two metals<ref>{{cite web|title=College of Arms: The Arms and Badge of Professor S.

It still holds true frequently in [[Germany]].\n\nThere are rare examples where the mantling is blazoned to complement the armiger's coat of arms, mimicking the ordinaries and charges on the escutcheon.

However, there have been other historical cultures which have used symbols and emblems to represent families or individuals, and in some cases these symbols have been adopted into Western heraldry. For example, the [[coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire]] incorporated the royal [[tughra]] as part of its [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], along with such traditional Western heraldic elements as the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]].\n\n====Greek symbols====\nAncient Greeks were among the first civilizations to use symbols consistently in order to identify a warrior, clan or a state.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The first record of a shield blazon is illustrated in [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''.\n\n====Mon====\n{{Main|Mon (emblem)}}\n{{nihongo|'''Mon'''|\u7d0b|}}, also {{nihongo|'''monsh\u014d'''|\u7d0b\u7ae0|}}, {{nihongo|'''mondokoro'''|\u7d0b\u6240|}}, and {{nihongo|'''kamon'''|\u5bb6\u7d0b|}}, are [[Japan]]ese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual or family. While ''mon'' is an encompassing term that may refer to any such device, ''kamon'' and ''mondokoro'' refer specifically to emblems used to identify a family.{{Elucidate|reason=This is the same as previously stated, so what is the difference with mon and monsh\u014d? |date=February 2016}} An authoritative ''mon'' reference compiles Japan's 241 general categories of ''mon'' based on structural resemblance (a single ''mon'' may belong to multiple categories), with 5116 distinct individual ''mon'' (it is however well acknowledged that there exist lost or obscure ''mon'' that are not in this compilation).<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u5bb6\u7d0b\u5927\u5168 |publisher={{lang|ja|\u68a7\u6850\u66f8\u9662}} |year=2004 |ISBN=434003102X}}</ref><ref>Some 6939 ''mon'' are [https://x181.secure.ne.jp/~x181007/kamon/goodslist.cgi listed here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028043638/http://x181.secure.ne.jp/~x181007/kamon/goodslist.cgi |date=2016-10-28 }}.</ref>\n\nThe devices are similar to the [[Heraldic badge|badges]] and [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] in European heraldic tradition, which likewise are used to identify individuals and families.  ''Mon'' are often referred to as [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]] in Western literature, another European heraldic device similar to the ''mon'' in function.\n\n====Socialist heraldry====\n{{Main|Socialist heraldry}}\n'''Socialist heraldry''', also called '''communist heraldry''', consists of emblems in a style typically adopted by [[communist state]]s and characterized by [[communist symbolism]]. Although commonly called ''[[coat of arms|coats of arms]]'', most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional heraldic sense and should therefore, in a strict sense, not be called arms at all.<ref name=\"von Volborth\">{{harvp|von Volborth|1981|page= 11}}</ref> Many communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of [[European heraldry]] in order to distance themselves from the [[monarchy|monarchies]] that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] was the first state to use socialist heraldry, beginning at its creation in 1922. The style became more widespread after [[World War II]], when many other communist states were established.

The tamga was normally the emblem of a particular tribe, clan or family. They were common among the Eurasian nomads throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages (including [[Alans]], [[Mongols]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Turkic peoples]]). Similar \"tamga-like\" symbols were sometimes also adopted by sedentary peoples adjacent to the Pontic-Caspian steppe both in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]],<ref>Ottfried Neubecker. ''Heraldik''. Orbis, 2002; Brook 154; Franklin and Shepard 120-121; Pritsak 78-79.</ref> such as the [[East Slavs]], whose ancient [[Symbols of the Rurikids|royal symbols]] are sometimes referred to as \"tamgas\" and have similar appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMwmcqwZUGcC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=rurikid+tamga&source=bl&ots=OZoyQCrJDu&sig=2nASSscIJn6WshI6ORaX5PoWiuI&hl=ru&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6ifi2sqPNAhXkNJoKHYB7DrEQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&q=rurikid%20tamga&f=false|title = Pre-modern Russia and Its World: Essays in Honor of Thomas S.

One could also adopt the tamga of one's master or ruler, therefore signifying said master's patronage. Outside of denoting ownership, tamgas also possessed religious significance, and were used as [[talisman]]s to protect one from curses (it was believed that, as symbols of family, tamgas embodied the power of one's heritage). Tamgas depicted geometric shapes, images of animals, items, or [[glyph]]s. As they were usually inscribed using heavy and unwieldy instruments, such as knives or brands, and on different surfaces (meaning that their appearance could vary somewhat), tamgas were always simple and stylised, and needed to be laconic and easily recognisable.<ref>\u0422\u0410\u041c\u0413\u0410 (\u043a \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0430). \u0412.\u0421. \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0445, No 7, \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0440, 2001, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 75-86)</ref>\n\n====Tughras====\n{{Main|Tughra}}\n{{Further|Coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire}}\nEvery sultan of the Ottoman Empire had his own monogram, called the tughra, which served as a royal symbol. A coat of arms in the European heraldic sense was created in the late 19th century. Hampton Court requested from Ottoman Empire the coat of arms to be included in their collection. As the coat of arms had not been previously used in Ottoman Empire, it was designed after this request and the final design was adopted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II on April 17, 1882. It included two flags: the flag of the Ottoman Dynasty, which had a crescent and a star on red base, and the flag of the Islamic Caliph, which had three crescents on a green base.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book|ref=harv |last=Pimbley |first=Arthur Francis |year=1908 |title=Pimbley's dictionary of heraldry |publisher=Pimbley|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry}}\n* {{cite web\n| accessdate = 2011-05-16\n| publisher = An Tir College of Heralds\n| title = What is an Achievement?\n| quote = An 'achievement' is a full formal display of a coat of arms.\n| url = http://www.antirheralds.org/display/achievements/achievements.html\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110420025929/http://antirheralds.org/display/achievements/achievements.html\n| archivedate = 20 April 2011\n| url-status = dead\n| df = dmy-all\n}}\n\n; Books\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book |author-link=Charles Boutell |last=Boutell |first=Charles |year=1890 |url = https://archive.org/details/heraldryancientm00boutrich |editor-first=S.
