Data that is typically considered to be user created ESI is made up of emails, documents, pictures and other file types created by a user, as opposed to data created by the computer's operating system (i.e. registry files, link files, unallocated space.  These are controlled or created by the computer and not the user). The objective of reviewing the user created data is to find information that may be used to base decisions on as part of an investigation.\n\n==Advantages of Forensic Search Software==\n\nForensic Search software differs from using the native applications (e.g. Outlook) or [[desktop search]] software (e.g. [[Google Desktop]]) to search the data in that no changes are made to the data during processing or searching that may impact the results or skew the findings. Forensic Search software will also allow access to the base metadata of items not available via the native application.

Features such as redaction and legal hold are standard in eDiscovery review software. It is also the case that Forensic Search software does not meet with the higher end tasks outlined in the widely accepted Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM). Tasks such as Identification, Collection, Preservation or Presentation are generally not covered by Forensic Search software.\n\nHowever, true eDiscovery review is generally the domain of qualified legal practitioners or companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/ethics/legal_ethics/opinions/opinion362.cfm |title=Ethics Opinion 362: Non-lawyer Ownership of Discovery Service Vendors |publisher=Dcbar.org |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://it-lex.org/district-of-columbia-bar-ediscovery-vendors-with-non-lawyers-cant-practice-law/ |title=District of Columbia Bar: eDiscovery Vendors with Non-Lawyers Can't Practice Law |publisher=IT-Lex |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>\n\nThe use of the term eDiscovery has become a catchall in some circles for the processing and searching of Electronically Stored Information (ESI). However, this is not a true representation of the term of eDiscovery. For a more detailed understanding of eDiscovery, the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) is a [http://www.edrm.net/resources/edrm-stages-explained good guideline].\n\nIt could be said that Forensic Search is more closely related to [[Early case assessment|Early Case Assessment (ECA)]] than eDiscovery as ECA does not require the rigor of a full eDiscovery review.\n\n==Evidence Values of User Created Data Versus Other Types of Data==\n\nWhen presenting data as part of a report that may be used to form a decision or as evidence, it is important that the data be correctly represented so the reader can understand it.\n\nIn the case of generating reports on system created data such as registry files, link files and other system created data this can be a costly exercise. It can also be the case that there is no straightforward answer or explanation.\n\nAn example of this would be attempting to explain to a lay person the method and techniques of decoding the [http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/userassist/ UserAssist Key] in the Windows System Registry. The UserAssist key can hold a great deal of information about the actions of the user of the computer. However to explain this key, the reviewer has to be able to identify the key and correctly interpret the key setting. The keys are often encoded by ROT 13.\n\nOnce these keys are decoded to human readable formats, the reviewer then has to show how a setting relates to the case.  It is often time-consuming to review hundreds, even thousands, of settings that at times only deliver very circumstantial and sometimes contentious findings.\n\nWhen reviewing user created data such as e-mail or contracts, reporting and understanding the findings is often much more straight forward. The semi skilled user will usually have a good grasp of how email works as they use it in their day-to-day work. A legal person will understand a contract and does not need specialist forensic knowledge to do so. This can lead to much lower costs of review and less contentious or circumstantial findings.\n\n==High-Level Functionality of Forensic Search Software==\n\nThe features of Forensic Search software are focused on allowing the user to search and view a range of data and users\u2019 files at one time.\n\nSpecific features of Forensic Search software are:\n* The ability to process varying types of data enabling it to be searched by the reviewer with little or no computer forensic knowledge\n* Keyword searching across all data and data types processed\n* The ability to create complex searches such as including or excluding data\n* Using MD5 and other algorithms to search and identify files and data\n* The ability to filter based on metadata such as dates, email addresses and file types\n* The ability to review different data typed in the same search results\n* The ability to view all results in the same user interface\n* The ability to export items to various formats i.e. email, Word, HTML\n* The ability to create shareable reports\n\n==Changes in Computer Forensics==\n\nThere are many newer and emerging fields of computer forensics such as Cloud forensics, Mobile Phone forensics, Network forensics, Memory Analysis, Browser forensics, forensic triage and Internet forensics.<ref>[http://www.e-discovery.co.nz/blog/facilitating-a-forensic-search.html]</ref> In the not so distant past a computer forensic expert's most common role was to attend a person's house, place of work or data center to forensically [http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Category:Forensics_File_Formats 'image'] all computers or devices that may be involved in a case. This was categorized as the collection phase.\n\nOnce collection phase was complete these images were reviewed and the ESI that was relevant was supplied to the interested parties. This required the computer forensic investigator to have a good deal of experience and training in:\n* Identifying which computer, applications or devices may be involved\n* How to disassemble a computer and extract the hard drives of the computer without causing damage.\n* How to correctly take a forensic image to keep chain of custody\n* How to use the forensic analysis software to correctly interpret and supply the results\n\nThis process was time-consuming and costly.  The computer forensic expert's primary role is to investigate the computer evidence (ESI).  They may not have been as familiar with the entire case or objectives as that of the case agent, detective, forensic accountant or crime analyst. This often led to non-perfect or time-consuming identification of the correct evidence items between the differing parties. What would immediately flag the interest of a detective with a deep knowledge of the case and parties involved may go unnoticed by a computer forensic expert. An example would be an email from a suspect in another case to a suspect in this case, or contact / phone calls to a witness from a suspect.\n\nTo compound the issue, there has been a massive increase in the size of the data that the computer forensic expert needs to collect. It is now often the case that the computer hard drive is not able to be imaged, for example if the computer that contains the evidence is too big, or the system cannot be shut down to take an image as it is a mission critical server such as an email server or company file server. The rise of [[Cloud computing]] has also added challenges to the collection of evidence. The data that requires collection and review may reside in the Cloud. In this case there is no computer available to image.  The forensic expert then needs to collect the information using forensic software designed to work with certain Cloud providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-response.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=344:f-response-404-and-the-new-cloud-connector&catid=34:blog-posts |title=F-Response 4.0.4 and the new Cloud Connector |publisher=F-response.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn short the collection of evidence has changed significantly in the past few years.
