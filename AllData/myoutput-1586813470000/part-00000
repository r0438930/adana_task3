In order to fulfill the primary objective of this operation - the covert collection of intelligence information in the Alaskan Territory - the agents were also interested in military information, and any intelligence that they deemed to be important. For coordination between the leaders of the operation and its agents there were Administrator Liaisons for the agents to contact. For this operation the agents were equipped with 30-06 rifles with a times 4 scope, a small calibre pistol with a maxim silencer, camera, climbing rope and various other things to keep the agents alive, all supplied by the government for the agents. The second part of the operation being a escape and evasion plan for downed American planes, this includes the supply caches that were available for all sections of the US military. During the operation the agents were paid an inactive fund of 3,000 dollars per year, which was said to be doubled once the invasion was to begin.\n\nAt the end of the operation there were a total of 89 agents presumably being placed in the various regions provided in the official document.

Ultimately the Operation ended due to the costs of maintaining the agents funds and the cost of supplying the caches in the unbearable weather.
