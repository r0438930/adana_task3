Miller's original, from his album ''[[Words and Music (Roger Miller album)|Words and Music]]'', was released in February 1966 and was a crossover hit for him, reaching Top Ten on the U.S. country and Adult Contemporary charts, as well as Top 40 on the pop charts. Since the release of Miller's original, the song has been covered by several other artists, including [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Neil Diamond]], a duet between [[David Frizzell]] and [[Shelly West]], [[Jules Shear]], and [[Brooks & Dunn]], whose version was a number-one country hit in 1998.\n\n==Content==\n\"Husbands and Wives\" is a mid-tempo waltz in the key of [[C major]]. In it, the narrator makes observations on a couple who is breaking up (\"Two broken hearts, lonely, looking like houses / Where nobody lives\").
