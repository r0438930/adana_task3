The seat of [[Giurgiu County]], it lies in the historical region of [[Muntenia]]. It is situated amid mud-flats and marshes on the left bank of the [[Danube]] facing the [[Bulgaria]]n city of [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] on the opposite bank. Three small islands face the city, and a larger one shelters its port, Smarda. The rich grain-growing land to the north is traversed by a railway to [[Bucharest]], the first line opened in Romania, which was built in 1869 and afterwards extended to Smarda. Giurgiu exports timber, grain, salt and petroleum, and imports coal, iron, and textiles.\n\nThe [[Danube Bridge|Giurgiu-Ruse Friendship Bridge]], in the shared [[Bulgaria]]n-Romanian section of the Danube, crosses the river in the outskirts of the city.\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|image1=Raffet - Foire de St. Pierre a Giourgevo.jpg|caption1=|image2=Giurgiu1848.jpg|caption2=Giurgiu in 1837}}\nThe area around Giurgiu was densely populated at the time of the [[Dacians]] (1st century BC) as archeological evidence shows, and [[Burebista]]'s capital was in this area (it is thought to be in [[Mih\u0103ile\u0219ti|Pope\u015fti]] on the [[Arge\u015f River]]). During [[Roman times]] this was the site of [[Theodorapolis]], a city built by the Roman emperor [[Justinian]] (483-565).\n\nThe city of Giurgiu was probably established in the 14th century as a port on the [[Danube]] by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchant adventurers, who established a bank and traded in silks and velvets.\n\nOne theory is that they called the city after the patron saint of Genoa, San Giorgio ([[St George]]), however [[Nicolae Iorga]] disputes this theory, arguing that Giurgiu is just an old Romanian form of George.<ref>{{cite book |last=Iorga |first=Nicolae |date=1928 |title=Istoria Rom\u00e2nilor prin c\u0103l\u0103tori |trans-title=History of Romanians through travellers |url=https://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Istoria_rom\u00e2nilor_prin_c\u0103l\u0103tori/\u00cenainte_de_\u00eentemeierea_domniilor |language=ro |location=Bucharest |publisher=Casa \u0218coalelor |isbn= |accessdate= |page=18}}</ref>\n\nIt was first mentioned in [[Codex Latinus Parisinus]] in 1395, during the reign of [[Mircea I of Wallachia]], and was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1420 as a way to control the Danube traffic. The Ottomans named the city ''Yerg\u00f6\u011f\u00fc'', as if from ''yer'' 'earth' + ''g\u00f6k'' 'sky,' but the name was probably given because of the similarity between the pronunciations of \"(San) Giorgio\" and \"Yerg\u00f6\u011f\u00fc\".\n\nAs a fortified city, Giurgiu figured often in the wars for the conquest of the lower Danube. It was the site of the October 1595 [[Battle of Giurgiu]], and figured in the struggle of [[Michael the Brave]] (1593\u20131601) against the Turks and in the later [[Russo-Turkish War (1787-1792)]]. It was burned in 1659. In 1771, the Ottomans built the [[monument istoric|historic]] [[Giurgiu Clocktower]] as a surveillance tower for [[Danube]] traffic. In 1829, its fortifications were finally razed, the only defence left being a castle on the island of Slobozia, connected to the shore by a bridge.\n\nIn 1952\u20131954, during the Communist regime, the [[USSR]] helped build the bridge between Giurgiu and [[Rousse|Ruse]], [[Danube Bridge|The Friendship Bridge]], a bridge on the Danube linking Romania and [[Bulgaria]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=left\n|source = Census data, 1930\u20131948.<ref>[https://sas.unibuc.ro/storage/downloads/analize-regionale-9/AG48a.RECENSAMANT48.pdf Populatia RPR la 25 ianuarie 1948, p. 14]</ref>\n|1900 |13977\n|1912 |20629\n|1930 |31016\n|1941 |26551\n|1948 |30197\n|1956 |32613\n|1966 |39199\n|1977 |51544\n|1992 |74191\n|2002 |69587\n|2011 |54655\n}}\n{{clear left}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, Giurgiu has a population of 54,655.\n\n==Notable natives==\n* [[Constantin Artachino]] (1870-1954), painter\n* [[Ioan A.
