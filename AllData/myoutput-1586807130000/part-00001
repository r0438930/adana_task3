It is produced in Canada, airing there on [[Teletoon]]. The remake mostly stays true to the original production, with a few key differences existing between the two. One episode of the show typically consists of two 12-minute episodes.

Possessing incredible strength, bravery and a penchant for repeatedly crashing into trees while vine-swinging, George acts as the protector of all the jungle's inhabitants. He also acts immature and refers to himself in the [[Illeism|third person]]. In the second season of the series, he now has muscles to resemble his design in the original series.\n* ''Ape'' \u2013 A sarcastic and intelligent [[gorilla]] that lives with George in the jungle. He functions as George's surrogate brother, parental figure and best friend, although his attempts to educate George have a long history of repeated failures. He also tends to serve as the voice of reason most of the time. In \"George's Birthday Present\", it is revealed Ape is 5 years old in ape years. Every time he hears the sound of Mitch's bongos, he dances uncontrollably, which results in mass insanity and the destruction of their tree house. He also dances on his fingers when George uses a leaf as a [[kazoo]] as revealed in \"Ape Goes Ape\". In season 2 Ape now has a British accent to match his intelligence.\n* Ursula \u2013 A [[tomboy]]ish city girl who came to live in the jungle with George and his friends along with her father Dr. Scott. She quickly forms a bond with Magnolia, causing the two to be frequently seen together. Young, reckless and eager to introduce modern culture into the jungle, she often tries to educate her new friends to the marvels of modern city life (such as [[Christmas]] or [[Traffic light|traffic systems]]), only to usually have her attempts backfire. Regardless, she does her best to assist her friends when necessary. She is still adjusting to jungle life, and so she still has much to learn. In season 2, her name is now Magnolia and ventures the land without her father. She is hoping to win some kind of reward when her research is complete (while also hoping to making it out alive?)\n* Magnolia \u2013 A native of the jungle and [[valley girl]] figure, she is one of George's closest friends since she came to the jungle. Despite her dressing in jungle attire (such as loincloths and sticks) as well as fits of hyperactivity, she originally appeared to be very well educated in both human and jungle knowledge, often helping to bridge the gap between Ursula's city life and jungle life. She speaks with a [[Southern American accent|Southern accent]], and can appear somewhat dimwitted at times. She is the daughter of the Witch Doctor, and therefore a Witch Doctor in training (according to the episode, \"Frankengeorge\"). In season 2, her name is now Ursula and this time speaks almost like a primitive caveman and acts as George's opposite wrecking mayhem through out the jungle.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Narrator \u2013 The narrator of each George of the Jungle episode. In comparison to the narrator of the original cartoon, he speaks in a documentary-style fashion, often beginning each episode claiming \"To survive in the jungle\". often followed by a situation in complete contrast to the first impression of his introduction.\n* Dr. Scott \u2013 The modern doctor now living in the jungle with his daughter. He has formed a somewhat friendly (and often hostile) rivalry with the local Witch Doctor, continuously trying to disprove his barbaric medicine and shaman skills with modern science (often with equally unsuccessful results). In season 2 his name is now \"Dr. Chicago\" who is not a father. Sometimes he will be a Dentist or Villains, his plans will mostly be about dentistry or conquest for the jungle, but they will be easily defeated by George and his Friends.\n* Witch Doctor \u2013 A very compact, diminutive character who believes his shaman skills are the solution to all problems. He often competed with Dr. Scott and his modern medicine to see who can solve a problem first, although neither usually provides the solution to whatever problem they tackle. Reasons unknown, he is no longer on the show in season 2.\n* Big Mitch \u2013 A conniving [[golden lion tamarin|golden marmoset]] and frequent pest to the jungle community. He lives in an ancient temple full of riches and booby traps, and has a pair of bongos with him.\n* Shep \u2013  George's [[elephant]] friend who actually acts like a dog. He travels with George on most of his adventures, only rivaled by the Tookie-Tookie bird. He is very untrained, and can often be seen destroying sections of the jungle. Shep disher to play with George a lot, often playing with him when he should be helping people throughout the jungle.\n* Tookie-Tookie Bird \u2013 George's second pet, a parrot-like bird that can say his own name.\n* Howie - A [[howler monkey]] who runs a juice bar.\n\n===Others===\n* Carl \u2013  Carl is a [[baboon]] who constantly makes a fool out of George and Ape.\n* Cousin Larry \u2013 George's arrogant human cousin, who does his best to win at everything, no matter the cost. He was eventually revealed to be a cheater in all his victories and was ousted from the jungle.\n* Cousin [[Papaya]] \u2013 George and Ape\u2019s cousin, a [[King Kong]]-like gorilla that made a promise to beat the living daylights out of anyone who would mess with George or Ape and the other gorillas.\n* Edward Madmun \u2013 The creator of Madmun Island. He has an associate (and later enemy) who helped him climb to the top of [[Mount Everest]] and swim Madmun across the [[English Channel]]. George, Ape and the others often accidentally say \"Madman\" for his name, but someone always reminds them \"It's MadMUN!\".\n*[[Lion]] \u2013 A lion who was defeated by George in his childhood.\n*[[Tiger]] \u2013 A hungry predator who likes to feast on small defenseless creatures and appears randomly in cameos (as seen in \"Rainy Season\" and \"Eagle Tick\").\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Lee Tockar]] (season 1) and [[Cory Doran]] (season 2) as George, Tookie-Tookie Bird\n* [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]] (season 1) and [[Robert Tinkler|Rob Tinkler]] (season 2) as a gorilla named Ape\n* [[Britt Irvin]] (season 1) and Bridget Wareham (season 2) as Ursula\n* [[Tabitha St. Germain]] (season 1) and [[Linda Ballantyne]] (season 2) as Magnolia\n* Mark Oliver as Dr. Towel Scott\n* [[Brian Drummond]] as Witch Doctor\n* [[Doron Bell]] as Big Mitch\n* [[Peter Kelamis]] as Cousin Larry\n* [[Michael Daingerfield]] (season 1) and [[Jeff Lumby]] (season 2) as Narrator\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main article|List of George of the Jungle (2007 TV series) episodes}}\n{{:List of George of the Jungle (2007 TV series) episodes}}\n\n==Home media==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!
