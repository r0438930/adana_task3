They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.\n\nBy 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of Rome|History of the Papacy}}\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}\n\nFor its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schn\u00fcrer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.

Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome, and thus under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated (in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them).<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>\n\nOther donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. But the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}\n\nWith effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}\n\nThe Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Donation of Pepin===\n{{main|Donation of Pepin}}\nWhen the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless  [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards \u2013 taking control of northern Italy \u2013 and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.\n\nIn 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]] and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.\n\n===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nThe precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] \u2013 and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] \u2013 is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.\n\nEvents in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum]] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[\u00c9mile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'\u00e9glise au pouvoir des la\u00efques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'\u00c9glise depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>\n\nIn practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.\n\nOver several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177.

The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}\n\nThe Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanct\u00e6 Matris Ecclesi\u00e6]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}\n\n[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Quirinal Palace]], papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the [[Renaissance]] until their annexation]]\n\n===Renaissance===\nDuring [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.\n\nPapal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict.

Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}\n\nAt its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy \u2014 [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.\n\n===Napoleonic era===\n[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}\n\nTwo years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} (February 1798).

For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.\n\n===Italian unification===\n{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\n[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.\n\nThe nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.\n\nAs a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons.

This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.\n\n[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]\n\nA unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}\n\nDespite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy \u2013 then under [[Pius XI]] \u2013 renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.\n\n==Regional governors==\n[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]\n\nAs the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.\n\n==Papal military==\nHistorically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>\nIn 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A. Coulombe, ''The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008</ref>\n\nThe Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.\n\nA small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Catholicism|Italy}}\n* [[Captain General of the Church]]\n* [[Donation of Constantine]]\n* [[History of Rome]]\n* [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n* [[Italian unification]]\n* [[Italian United Provinces]]\n* [[Law of Guarantees]]\n* [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]\n* [[Roman Question]]\n* [[War of the Eight Saints]]\n* [[Index of Vatican City-related articles]]\n* [[Papal Navy]]\n* [[Papal Zouaves]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Catholic|wstitle=States of the Church}}\n* Chambers, D.S. 2006.

They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.\n\nBy 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of Rome|History of the Papacy}}\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}\n\nFor its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schn\u00fcrer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.

Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome, and thus under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated (in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them).<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>\n\nOther donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. But the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}\n\nWith effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}\n\nThe Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Donation of Pepin===\n{{main|Donation of Pepin}}\nWhen the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless  [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards \u2013 taking control of northern Italy \u2013 and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.\n\nIn 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]] and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.\n\n===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nThe precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] \u2013 and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] \u2013 is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.\n\nEvents in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum]] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[\u00c9mile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'\u00e9glise au pouvoir des la\u00efques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'\u00c9glise depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>\n\nIn practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.\n\nOver several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.\n\n===Avignon Papacy===\n{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}\n\n[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]\n\nFrom 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings.

The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}\n\nThe Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanct\u00e6 Matris Ecclesi\u00e6]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}\n\n[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Quirinal Palace]], papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the [[Renaissance]] until their annexation]]\n\n===Renaissance===\nDuring [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.\n\nPapal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxpapalstate.html|title= History of the Papal States|work=World History at KDMLA|first=Alexander |last=Ganse|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> Julius II, the \"Warrior Pope\", fought on their behalf.\n\n===Reformation===\nThe [[Reformation]] began in 1517.

Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}\n\nAt its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy \u2014 [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.\n\n===Napoleonic era===\n[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}\n\nTwo years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} (February 1798).

For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.\n\n===Italian unification===\n{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\n[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.\n\nThe nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.\n\nAs a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons.

This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.\n\n[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]\n\nA unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}\n\nDespite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy \u2013 then under [[Pius XI]] \u2013 renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.\n\n==Regional governors==\n[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]\n\nAs the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.\n\n==Papal military==\nHistorically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>\nIn 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A. Coulombe, ''The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008</ref>\n\nThe Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.\n\nA small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Catholicism|Italy}}\n* [[Captain General of the Church]]\n* [[Donation of Constantine]]\n* [[History of Rome]]\n* [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n* [[Italian unification]]\n* [[Italian United Provinces]]\n* [[Law of Guarantees]]\n* [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]\n* [[Roman Question]]\n* [[War of the Eight Saints]]\n* [[Index of Vatican City-related articles]]\n* [[Papal Navy]]\n* [[Papal Zouaves]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Catholic|wstitle=States of the Church}}\n* Chambers, D.S. 2006.
