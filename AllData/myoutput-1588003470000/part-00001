Buses are charged through an overhead charging station that is placed at maintenance facilities as well as route terminals.\n\n== History ==\nProterra, Inc., was founded in Golden, Colorado, by Dale Hill in 2004. Hill had previously founded TransTeq, a Denver, Colorado, bus manufacturing company that built [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]] hybrid buses throughout the 1990s, as well as Alumatech, a manufacturing company that made aluminum dump trailers.\n\nFollowing the [[Federal Transit Administration]] (FTA)'s push for alternative fuels and forms of mobility through such programs as the Clean Fuels Grant Program Bus and Bus Facilities,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fta.dot.gov/grants/13094_3557.html |title=Clean Fuels Grant Program Bus and Bus Facilities (5309, 5318) |publisher=Federal Transit Administration |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115193109/http://fta.dot.gov:80/grants/13094_3557.html |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the [[Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery|TIGER]] and TIGGER programs, Hill wanted go beyond the success of his CNG buses that launched the world's first fleet of alternative fuel buses at the 16th Street Mall in Denver, Colorado.
