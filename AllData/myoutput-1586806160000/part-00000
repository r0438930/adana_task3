It had ownership interests and brand partnerships with several carriers.\n\nContinental started out as one of the smaller carriers in the United States, known for its limited operations under the regulated era. After 1978, Continental grew into one of the country's largest carriers despite facing financial troubles and other issues, eventually becoming one of the more successful airlines in the United States.\n\nThe airline merged with [[UAL Corporation]] (the parent company of [[United Airlines]]) via a [[stock swap]] in 2010.

Varney]], who was also a founder of [[United Airlines]]) was formed in 1934, operating [[airmail]] and passenger services in the [[American Southwest]] over a route originating from [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and extending through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]] to [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. The airline commenced operations with the [[Lockheed Vega]], a single-engine plane that carried four passengers.<ref name=\"Serling\">Serling, Robert J., Maverick: The story of Robert Six and Continental Airlines ({{ISBN|0-385-04057-1}}), Doubleday & Company, 1974.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Varney was awarded a 17-cent-rate airmail contract between Pueblo and El Paso; it carried passengers as a sideline. Following [[Air_Mail_scandal|cancellation of all domestic airmail contracts]] by the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration in 1934, [[Robert F. Six]] learned of an opportunity to buy into the Southwest Division of Varney Speed Lines which needed money to handle its newly won Pueblo-El Paso route. Six was introduced to Louis Mueller (who would serve as Chairman of the Board of Continental until February 28, 1966). Mueller had helped found the Southwest Division of Varney in 1934 with Walter T. Varney. As an upshot of all this, Six bought into the airline with US$90,000 and became general manager on July 5, 1936. The carrier was renamed Continental Air Lines (later changed to \"Airlines\") on July 8, 1937. Six relocated the airline's headquarters to Denver Union (later Stapleton) Airport in [[Denver]] in October 1937.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\">Davies, R.E.G., Continental Airlines: the first fifty years, 1934\u20131984, Pioneer Publications, 1984.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Six changed the name to \"Continental\" because he wanted the airline name to reflect his desire to have the airline fly all directions throughout the United States.<ref name=\"COFacts\">\"[http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts Continental Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719164330/http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts |date=July 19, 2010 }}.\" [[Continental (magazine)|Continental Magazine]].

Profits from military transportation and aircraft conversion enabled Continental to contemplate expansion and acquisition of new airliners after the war.<ref name=\"Serling\"/> Among those were the [[Douglas DC-3]], the [[Convair 240]] and the [[Convair 340]]. The Convairs were Continental's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] airliners.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/> The airline's early route was [[El Paso]] to Albuquerque and Denver, with routes being added during the war from Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso eastward across Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. In 1946 Continental flew Denver to Kansas City, Wichita, Tulsa, and to Oklahoma City, and from El Paso and Albuquerque to San Antonio. Each route included stops in several of 22 smaller cities.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Continental began several interchange routes with American, Braniff, and United Airlines. Routes were operated on American from Los Angeles and San Francisco to El Paso continuing onto Continental's route to San Antonio and Houston.  Continental's Denver to Kansas City route would interchange onto St. Louis with Braniff Airways and United's routes from Seattle and Portland to Denver would interchange with Continental's routes onto Wichita and Tulsa. These interchange routes continued for many years until Continental was able to secure routes of its own between each city.\n\nIn 1955 Continental merged with [[Pioneer Air Lines]], gaining access to 16 more cities in Texas and New Mexico. In August 1953 Continental flew to 35 airports and Pioneer flew to 19, but Continental's network didn't reach beyond Denver, El Paso, Houston and Kansas City until April 1957 when it started Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles, two [[Douglas DC-7]]Bs a day each way. Pioneer's Executive Vice President [[Harding Lawrence|Harding Luther Lawrence]] arrived at Continental as a result of the merger. Bob Six commented on more than one occasion that, \"the reason we bought Pioneer was to get Harding.\" Harding Lawrence implemented several innovative changes at Continental as well as a flamboyant advertising campaign during his ten years as Six's protege. During Lawrence's tenure Continental grew by 500 percent. Lawrence left Continental in April 1965 to head [[Braniff Airways]].<ref name=UPI>{{cite web|last=United Press International|title=Airline Pioneer Harding Lawrence Dies|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/01/17/Airline-pioneer-Harding-Lawrence-dies/UPI-69351011319865/|work=United Press International|publisher=upi.com|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nSix petitioned the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB) for longer routes to larger cities, hoping to transform the regional into a trunkline like [[United Airlines]], [[TWA]], and [[American Airlines]]. He was discussing with [[Boeing]] for Continental to become one of the first to operate the soon-to-be-launched [[Boeing 707|707]]. The timing was crucial, since new routes would justify the 707s, and vice versa.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Robert F. Six, Chairman-CEO, Continental Airlines, 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Robert F. Six]], chairman-CEO, Continental Airlines, 1936\u20131981]]\n\nContinental Airlines had seen a broad expansion of its routes, thanks to a responsive CAB and persistent efforts by Six and Executive Vice President [[Harding Lawrence]] (who came to Continental in the Pioneer merger), who both frequently referred to his company as \"the Airline that needs to grow.\"<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\">Christian, J. Scott, former Continental employee and manager, Bring Songs to the Sky: Recollections of Continental Airlines, 1970\u20131986, Quadran Press, 1998.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} In 1958 Continental began turboprop flights with the [[Vickers Viscount]] on the new medium-haul routes. The CAB permitted Continental to drop service at many smaller cities, enabling the carrier's new aircraft to operate more economically on longer flights. In 1960 Continental flew more than three times the passenger-miles it had in 1956. (''Aviation Week'' June 22, 1959: \"Continental's current re-equipment program \u2014 involving a total cost of $64 million for the Boeings, Viscounts and DC-7Bs \u2014 was launched in 1955 when the carrier's net worth amounted to $5.5 million.\")\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s Six was the airline industry's leading lower-fare advocate. He predicted that increased traffic, not higher fares, was the answer to the airline industry's problems. To amazement from the industry he introduced the [[Economy class#Airlines|economy fare]] on the Chicago-Los Angeles route in 1962. He later pioneered a number of other low or discount fares which made air travel available to many who could not previously afford it. One of Continental's early innovations was a system-wide economy excursion fare which cut the standard coach fares by more than 25%.<ref name=\"Serling\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Continental took delivery of the first of five 707-124s in spring 1959, and started Chicago-Los Angeles nonstop on June 8.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Having so few jets, Continental needed radical innovations to the 707 maintenance program. It developed the \"progressive maintenance\" program, which enabled Continental to fly its 707 fleet seven days a week, achieving greater aircraft utilization than any other jet operator in the industry.<ref name=\"Serling\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Six, not being satisfied with 707 service, introduced innovations and luxe cuisine on Continental's 707 flights which were described as, \"...&nbsp;nothing short of luxurious\" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and, \"...&nbsp;clearly, the finest in the airline industry\" by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[File:Boeing 707-124 (Continental Airlines) LAX.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 707]] at Los Angeles, 1967]]\nIn the early 1960s Continental added flights from Los Angeles to Houston, nonstop as well as via Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Midland-Odessa, Austin, and/or San Antonio. In 1963 the company headquarters moved from Denver to Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} By late 1963 Continental had discontinued service to most of its smaller cities in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas with the exception of Lawton, OK and Wichita Falls, TX which continued operating with DC-9 and 727 jets until 1977. Total passenger-miles in 1967 were more than five times greater than in 1960, but 61% of the 1967 total was on unscheduled flights (mostly transpacific charters). During the late 1960s the company disposed of the last of its turboprop and piston-powered aircraft\u2014one of the first U.S. airlines to do so.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> Continental replaced the Viscount fleet with [[Douglas DC-9-10]]s and then added [[Boeing 727-100]]s and [[727-200]]s.  The DC-9 and 727 were to become the workhorses of the fleet from the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> The DC-9s were phased out by the late 1970s (although the type reappeared after mergers in the 1980s with an example being [[Texas International Airlines]] DC-9s which were added to the CO fleet); the 727-200 was the mainstay of its narrow-body fleet until the late 1980s. In 1968 a new [[livery]] was launched: orange and gold cheatlines on a white fuselage; and a black \"jetstream\" logo (by Six's friend, the noted graphic designer [[Saul Bass]]) on the iconic \"Golden Tails\" of the airline's aircraft. The slogans adopted in 1968 and used for more than a decade were, \"The Airline That Pride Built\" and, \"The Proud Bird with the Golden Tail\".<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> 1960s saw international routes awarded to Continental (to New Zealand and Australia) in the Transpacific Case, but they were cancelled by the Nixon Administration.\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines B737-200 N7381F.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing 737-200 with 1968\u20131991 \"meatball\" logo and livery designed by [[Saul Bass]]]]\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] Continental provided extensive cargo and troop transportation for [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] forces to Asian and the Pacific bases.

With Continental's experience in Pacific operations, the carrier formed subsidiary [[Air Micronesia]] in May 1968, inaugurating [[island hopping]] routes between [[Yap]]/[[Saipan]]/[[Guam]], [[Majuro]], Rota, [[Chuuk International Airport|Truk]], Ponape ([[Pohnpei]]) and Honolulu.<ref name=\"Serling\"/> \"Air Mike\", as it was known, initially operated with [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100]] aircraft with open-ocean survival gear, doppler radar, and a large complement of spare parts (including tires).<ref name=\"Serling\"/> A senior mechanic flew on every Air Mike flight until the late 1970s. Air Micronesia operated as subsidiary [[Continental Micronesia]] until 2010.

On June 26, 1970, Continental became the second carrier (after TWA) to put the 747 into U.S. domestic service. Its upper-deck first class lounge and main deck \"Polynesian Pub\" won awards worldwide for the most refined cabin interior among all airlines, as did meal services developed by Continental's Cordon Bleu-trained executive chef, Lucien DeKeyser.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Continental's 747 services from Chicago and Denver to Los Angeles and Honolulu set the standard for service in the western U.S.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> On June 1, 1972, Continental's widebody [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] service began. Six had insisted that Continental place a large order for DC-10s with manufacturer [[McDonnell Douglas]]. This decision again proved prescient, since the publicity associated with Continental's splashy 747 service Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles-Honolulu had stimulated increased market share and increased traffic for all carriers. Denver, Houston and Seattle were growing rapidly in the 1970s; the DC-10s took over most flights between Denver and Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle, and between Houston and Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-224 N32718 CO ORD 19.02.78 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-224]] at [[Chicago O'Hare Airport]] in 1978]]\nDuring the 1970s, Denver served as the airline's main hub. The 747s were focused on the Chicago-Los Angeles-Honolulu routes, with one daily round trip through Denver. The DC-10s served large markets (Los Angeles to Chicago, Denver, Houston and Honolulu; and from Denver to Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Houston). DC-9s and 727s predominated elsewhere and added frequencies on DC-10 routes.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Next to [[Braniff]], Continental operated fewer aircraft types (four: the 747, DC-10, 727-200, and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9-10]]) during this period than any U.S. trunkline, affording savings in parts, maintenance, and crew training.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The DC-10 enabled the airline to capitalize on traffic growth in the west. Continental saw market share grow annually in each DC-10 market through the 1970s, until relative market parity was achieved with United, the principal competitor on most of the DC-10 routes. The same innovations introduced on the 747s appeared on Continental's DC-10s, including the \"Polynesian Pub\", but after the [[1973 oil crisis]] more seats were needed and the DC-10 pubs were removed.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Continental phased out its 747s in 1978 in favor of the DC-10s (747s would return to Continental during the Lorenzo era, flying Newark to London and Paris). From the late 1970s until it merged with Texas International, Continental operated only DC-10s and 727-200s.  In the very late seventies, prior to the merger, 727-100s were added.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1982, Continental was headquartered at the west end of the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] on World Way West. The facility included the general offices, system operations control, the central maintenance facility, flight kitchen, and Los Angeles crew bases.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}<ref>''World Airline Directory''.

President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Civil Aeronautics Board chairman [[Alfred E. Kahn|Alfred Kahn]] had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry, which would dissolve the CAB and for the first time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without government supervision where they would fly, and how much they could charge. Continental began flights from Denver to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa/St. Petersburg in Florida. That year, President Carter authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between [[Air Micronesia]] destination [[Saipan]] and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via [[Honolulu]], [[American Samoa]], Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} After the 1978 passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] Continental embarked on a route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to Houston and Denver, and from Denver to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].<ref name=\"Scott\"/> That month Continental started DC-10 flights between Los Angeles and [[Taipei]], via Honolulu and [[Guam]]. Service between Houston and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979 Continental linked Denver with Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco and San Jose and also began Houston-Tampa service.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide. Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, so flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental's post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, with the corresponding expansion of facilities at both of these airports. In Denver, Continental's rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new [[Denver International Airport]], which would be completed almost fifteen years later.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines DC-10-10 N68042.jpg|thumb|left|Continental DC-10 at Narita Airport, Japan]]\nWhile deregulation allowed Continental to expand into new profitable areas, it hurt the company's existing business as consumers were for the first time able to choose lower fares over Continental's better service. In 1978 Continental explored the possibility of a merger with [[Western Airlines]], which held a nearby headquarters and similar fleet.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The route systems would have been complementary, with little overlap; although they both served the Western states, Continental had strength in Hawaii, southern-tier and the [[Great Plains]] states; Western's strengths were in the California intrastate market, Alaska, Mexico, and the [[Intermountain West]]. Both airlines served the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Rocky Mountain]] states, but along different routes from Los Angeles, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle and Phoenix. The merger did not take place.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> Unlike some airlines (notably [[Braniff]] whose expansion was so rapid and unsustainable that the additional costs made investment recovery impossible, and the carrier was forced into bankruptcy and liquidation), Continental's expansion after passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] seems, in retrospect, to have been appropriate. The markets that were added were almost all profitable, absorbing some of the hits to its existing markets and helping it in difficult times between 1982 and 1994.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1981, [[Texas Air Corporation]], an airline holding company controlled by U.S. aviation entrepreneur [[Frank Lorenzo]], acquired Continental after a contentious battle with Continental's management who were determined to resist Lorenzo. Continental's labor unions also fiercely resisted, fearing what they termed as \"Lorenzo's deregulation tactics\", which they believed implied that he wanted to make Continental a non-union airline. Lorenzo viewed the company as stuck in the pre-deregulation era and in need of serious changes to stay competitive. Continental was experiencing financial challenges both before and after Lorenzo's takeover, and he demanded immediate wage cuts and layoffs to keep the company afloat.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\">{{cite book |author=Bamber, G.J. |author2=Gittell, J.H. |author3=Kochan, T.A. |author4=von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |chapter=Alternative Strategies for New Entrants: Southwest vs. Ryanair |isbn=978-0-8014-4747-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801447471 }}</ref> During this struggle, Continental Airlines CEO, [[Alvin Feldman]], died from suicide in his office.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Continental Air Chief Dies, Apparent Suicide|work=New York Times|date=August 10, 1981|accessdate=July 16, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/10/us/continental-air-chief-dies-apparent-suicide.html?&pagewanted=print|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Lorenzo became Continental's new Chairman and CEO.

Chapter 11 saved the company from liquidation, but required substantial reorganization, which began immediately. Following bankruptcy, Continental was freed of its contractual obligations and imposed a series of new labor agreements on its union workers, sharply reducing the airline's labor costs.<ref>Moss Kanter, Rosabeth, Confidence \u2013 How Winning Streaks and Losing Streaks Begin and End ({{ISBN|1-4000-5290-4}}), Crown Business, 2004</ref> Continental became vastly more competitive with the new airline startups then emerging and thriving in the southwestern U.S., but employee attitudes and loyalty were adversely affected. By the end of 1984, Continental recorded a $50&nbsp;million profit.

Additional service from Newark to London and Paris started after the airline's merger with People Express Airlines in 1987. However, the airline was still facing significant challenges with consistently low reliability rankings and a high level of customer complaints compared with its competitors.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\"/> In October 1985, Texas Air Corp. made an offer for a Denver-based regional carrier, [[Frontier Airlines (1950\u20131986)|Frontier Airlines]], opening a bidding war with [[People Express]], which was headed by Lorenzo's former TI associate [[Donald Burr|Don Burr]]. People Express paid a substantial premium for Frontier's high-cost operation. The acquisition, funded by debt, did not seem rational to industry observers from either the route integration or the operating philosophy points of view, but was in the opinion of most industry analysts rather an attempt by Burr to best his former boss, Lorenzo.<ref name=\"Scott\"/><ref name=\"Delaney\"/> On August 24, 1986, Frontier filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. With People Express hemorrhaging cash, Texas Air acquired People Express on September 15, 1986, at the same time gaining Frontier, whose strong network in the Great Plains and intermountain West reinforced Continental's already formidable Denver hub. Because it had been the largest airline operating in the New York market, the People Express hub at Newark would permit Continental to expand its East Coast services dramatically. Continental soon became the third-largest airline in the U.S. and the predominant force in the New York, Denver and Houston airline markets. {{Disputed inline|date=April 2019}}\n\nContinental emerged from bankruptcy on June 30, 1986, with improved asset and cash flow positions and a more competitive route structure with routes radiating to every large U.S. city from major hubs at Denver and Houston.<ref name=\"Scott\"/><ref name=\"Delaney\"/> Continental also began developing its Midwest hub at [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] in 1986, just as United Airlines began to transfer its Cleveland hub operations to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Fairfax County, Virginia.

While at Continental, Bethune created the Go-Forward plan, to fix problems with the airline, which included employee morale, the quality of the product, and the route structure, among others. Bethune began by ordering new aircraft in an effort to convert to an all-Boeing fleet.

The majority of Continental flights were operated from its hubs, with a few exceptions (Seattle-Anchorage, Los Angeles-Honolulu, and Los Angeles-Havana, LaGuardia \u2013 Aruba). Some affiliated airlines used the [[Continental Connection]] name also operate flights not involving hubs, such as [[Gulfstream International Airlines]], which operated intra-Florida and Florida-Bahamas services.\n\n[[File:Terminal E Waiting area.jpg|thumb|Continental was the dominant operator at [[Houston Intercontinental Airport]]]]\n\nFor almost 40 years, Continental operated a very large hub in [[Denver]], Colorado, but took the decision to close that hub in 1995 immediately after the opening of [[Denver International Airport]] (DIA), which represented a significantly higher-cost operation than the former Stapleton Airport, which DIA had replaced. The abrupt nature of this change came as a shock to Denver, which was experiencing dramatic growth. The void left by Continental's departure allowed the establishment of the \"new\" [[Frontier Airlines]] (a startup, rather than the original carrier of that name). Both Frontier and Southwest Airlines (which entered the Denver market after Continental's dehubbing) expanded quickly to fill the vacuum created by Continental's closing of its Denver hub.\n\nFor the first forty years of its existence, Continental was a domestic airline; however, especially after the incorporation of [[Texas International Airlines|Texas International]] routes, it has served more Mexican destinations than any other U.S. carrier since the mid-1980s.\n\nContinental first entered the transatlantic market in April 1985, with the introduction of a Houston-[[Gatwick Airport|London-Gatwick]] service. Long prevented from serving [[London Heathrow Airport]] because of the provisions of the [[Bermuda II]] agreement, which only allowed [[British Airways]], [[Virgin Atlantic]], [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] to operate flights from Heathrow to the United States, Continental maintained its London services at Gatwick, where in 2007 as many as six flights a day were offered to Newark, Houston, and Cleveland.\n\nIn March 2008, an [[Open Skies Agreement]] between the U.S. and the European Union became effective, invalidating Bermuda II restrictions that had limited the number of carriers and cities in the U.S. that could serve London-Heathrow. In November 2007 Continental announced that new, nonstop, twice-daily service from its hubs at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] and [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] to London-Heathrow would be offered; and this service was inaugurated on March 29, 2008. The service replaced existing frequencies to London-Gatwick and are offered with a combination of [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] and [[757-200]] equipment, with flat beds guaranteed in the BusinessFirst cabin.<ref>\"[https://archive.today/20120628230019/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=85779&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1078367&highlight= Continental Airlines to Launch Twice-Daily Nonstop Flights to Heathrow From Both New York and Houston]\", ''Continental Airlines''</ref> Continental has grown its presence at London-Heathrow to seven daily flights; two to Houston-Intercontinental and five to Newark.\n\n[[File:Bush terminal E.jpg|thumb|Continental operated international flights from Terminal E at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] in [[Houston]].]]\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], Continental's extensive military charter operations established a presence in the Pacific region that formed the basis for the [[Air Micronesia]] operation. Service to Japan was initiated in the 1970s from Guam and Saipan, and by the late 1980s, nonstop service between Seattle and Tokyo was briefly offered with [[Boeing 747|747]] equipment, soon to be replaced with a direct Honolulu-[[Narita International Airport|Tokyo (Narita)]] flight. Through the 1990s, Continental maintained a minimal presence in the long-haul trans-Pacific market, until the delivery of 777-200ERs in 1998 which saw the addition of nonstop Tokyo service from Houston and Newark. By 2007, Hong Kong and Beijing were added to the network, and in 2009 Shanghai was added, all from the Newark hub.

United repainted this aircraft to the standard Globe livery in May 2016, and then painted a different airframe in the Blue Skyway, sister ship N75435. The reason for the change is currently unknown to the public.\n\nFirst Class was offered on Domestic Flights, and BusinessFirst was offered on Transatlantic/Transpacific Flights.\n\nContinental Airlines was one of three carriers (with [[American Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]]) to sign an exclusivity agreement with Boeing in the late 1990s. When Boeing acquired [[McDonnell Douglas]], the European Union forced Boeing to void the contracts. Both parties had been adhering to the terms under a [[gentlemen's agreement]].\n\nContinental was one of the first major airlines to fly Boeing 757s on transatlantic routes. There have been some instances of range limitations on west-bound transatlantic flights due to strong headwinds resulting in a fuel stop which does not appear on the timetable, but these stops are not common. The use of the 757 with its smaller [[seating capacity]] allowed for \"thin\" routes (routes with less passenger traffic) to be economically viable. It allowed non-stop service from smaller cities, such as [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland and [[Hamburg]], Germany to the New York gateway. Previously, customers originating at these and similar cities needed to connect at European gateways like London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, or Frankfurt, in order to travel to New York. United retains a number of these flight routes, mostly based out of Newark, including Newark-Hamburg, Newark-Dublin, and Newark-Berlin.\n\n===Historic fleet===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''CAL, March 1960'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%200497.html |title=Flight International April 8, 1960 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 707\u2013120]]\n|4\n|1\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-3]]\n|10\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-6]]\n|1\n|0\n|Leased\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-6]]B\n|2\n|0\n|1 leased\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-7]]B\n|5\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Vickers Viscount|Vickers Viscount 812]]\n|15\n|\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''37'''\n|'''1'''\n|\n|}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''CAL, March 1970'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%200529.html |title=Flight International March 26, 1970 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Concorde]] ([[Supersonic transport|SST]])\n|0\n|3\n| Not delivered\n|-\n|[[Boeing 2707]] ([[Supersonic transport|SST]])\n|0\n|3\n| Not manufactured\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-320C]]\n|13\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 720B]]\n|8\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100C]]\n|1\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-200]]\n|12\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-100]]\n|0\n|4\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9-10F]]\n|19\n|0\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''62'''\n|'''10'''\n|\n|}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''CAL, July 1980'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%201919.html|title=World Airline Directory 1980|publisher=Flight International |date=July 26, 1980|accessdate=December 11, 2011}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100]]\n|16\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-200]]\n|36\n|9\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-10]]\n|7\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-10CF]]\n|6\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-30]]\n|0\n|2\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''65'''\n|'''11'''\n|\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Cabin===\nContinental Airlines had a two-class service configuration, First/BusinessFirst and Economy Class, for aircraft in the mainline fleets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/default.aspx |title=Continental Airlines Aircraft Information |publisher=Continental.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302102529/https://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/default.aspx |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====BusinessFirst====\nContinental had begun deploying BusinessFirst seats that allowed customers to lie completely flat, reclining 180-degrees and providing {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m}} of sleeping space in the fully extended position on its 777-200ER and 757-200 aircraft.

Installation on the [[Boeing 767]] fleet was to follow in 2011. The anticipated completion of the roll-out across Continental's entire international fleet was planned for August 2012. In addition, all 787 deliveries were to have the seats installed.\n\nContinental considered BusinessFirst to be its signature onboard product, and the service is a frequent subject of advertising campaigns. Customers seated in the BusinessFirst cabin on longhaul flights from the United States to Europe, Asia, select cities in South America, and the Middle East received special ground services, including EliteAccess priority bag service at check-in, expedited security screening (where available), access to Continental's Presidents Club or affiliated Star Alliance lounges, personalized Continental Concierge service, and dedicated boarding procedures.\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines BusinessFirst entree.jpg|thumb|In-flight meal in BusinessFirst]]\n\nOn board, multi-course meals were designed by Continental's Congress of Chefs, beverages were selected by Continental's Wine Masters, and service was provided by flight attendants from separate International crew bases at Newark and Houston. Most flights had at least two meal services. Entertainment was offered at each individual seat, and passengers on Boeing 777 and 757 aircraft had access to a new Audio-Video On Demand system with touch-screen controls. 767 aircraft featured older, looped-video multi-channel entertainment systems, generally with a wider programming selection than Economy Class. 767 aircraft were expected to receive AVOD in the near future. Customers also were provided headphones, a large pillow, wool blanket, and amenity kit prior to departure. Upon arrival, BusinessFirst customers have access to shower facilities and arrival lounges at most airports.\n\nContinental offered a modified BusinessFirst service on flights from the United States mainland to Hawaii. All flights offered the same suite of EliteAccess ground services, along with a similar main meal service on board. Amenities such as pillows and headsets also were the same, but no amenity kits were offered. On flights from Newark and Houston to Honolulu, Continental operated Boeing 767-400ER aircraft with typical recliner-style BusinessFirst seats. On flights from Los Angeles and Orange County to Honolulu/Kahului with [[Boeing 737]] equipment, domestic First Class seats were substituted. Nonstop flights from Guam to Honolulu were exempt from most of these modifications and more closely resembled the standard BusinessFirst service.\n\nNo complimentary upgrades were offered to Continental OnePass Elite members on any intercontinental flights offering BusinessFirst service. However, on 767-operated BusinessFirst services to Hawaii, Continental offered a day-of-departure buy up fee for any revenue coach class fare, provided seats were available. Mainland-Hawaii was the only BusinessFirst market where such upgrades are available. In addition, OnePass Elites were eligible for complimentary automatic upgrades on Continental-operated flights from California to Hawaii.\n[[File:Continental Airlines domestic First Class dinner.jpg|thumb|left|Domestic First Class dinner]]\n\n====Domestic First Class====\nDomestic First Class was offered on domestic flights.

When AF4590 subsequently departed, Concorde's left main landing gear tires struck the strip of metal and were punctured. The tires then exploded and tire rubber fragments penetrated Concorde's wing fuel tanks, starting fires in engines 1 and 2, leading to the crash which killed all aboard and four people on the ground.

Continental mechanic John Taylor was given a 15-month suspended sentence, while another airline operative and three French officials were cleared of all charges. The court ruled that the crash resulted from a piece of metal from a Continental jet that was left on the runway; the object punctured a tire on the Concorde and then ruptured a fuel tank.

It had ownership interests and brand partnerships with several carriers.\n\nContinental started out as one of the smaller carriers in the United States, known for its limited operations under the regulated era. After 1978, Continental grew into one of the country's largest carriers despite facing financial troubles and other issues, eventually becoming one of the more successful airlines in the United States.\n\nThe airline merged with [[UAL Corporation]] (the parent company of [[United Airlines]]) via a [[stock swap]] in 2010.

Varney]], who was also a founder of [[United Airlines]]) was formed in 1934, operating [[airmail]] and passenger services in the [[American Southwest]] over a route originating from [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and extending through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]] to [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. The airline commenced operations with the [[Lockheed Vega]], a single-engine plane that carried four passengers.<ref name=\"Serling\">Serling, Robert J., Maverick: The story of Robert Six and Continental Airlines ({{ISBN|0-385-04057-1}}), Doubleday & Company, 1974.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Varney was awarded a 17-cent-rate airmail contract between Pueblo and El Paso; it carried passengers as a sideline. Following [[Air_Mail_scandal|cancellation of all domestic airmail contracts]] by the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration in 1934, [[Robert F. Six]] learned of an opportunity to buy into the Southwest Division of Varney Speed Lines which needed money to handle its newly won Pueblo-El Paso route. Six was introduced to Louis Mueller (who would serve as Chairman of the Board of Continental until February 28, 1966). Mueller had helped found the Southwest Division of Varney in 1934 with Walter T. Varney. As an upshot of all this, Six bought into the airline with US$90,000 and became general manager on July 5, 1936. The carrier was renamed Continental Air Lines (later changed to \"Airlines\") on July 8, 1937. Six relocated the airline's headquarters to Denver Union (later Stapleton) Airport in [[Denver]] in October 1937.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\">Davies, R.E.G., Continental Airlines: the first fifty years, 1934\u20131984, Pioneer Publications, 1984.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Six changed the name to \"Continental\" because he wanted the airline name to reflect his desire to have the airline fly all directions throughout the United States.<ref name=\"COFacts\">\"[http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts Continental Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719164330/http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts |date=July 19, 2010 }}.\" [[Continental (magazine)|Continental Magazine]].

Profits from military transportation and aircraft conversion enabled Continental to contemplate expansion and acquisition of new airliners after the war.<ref name=\"Serling\"/> Among those were the [[Douglas DC-3]], the [[Convair 240]] and the [[Convair 340]]. The Convairs were Continental's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] airliners.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/> The airline's early route was [[El Paso]] to Albuquerque and Denver, with routes being added during the war from Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso eastward across Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. In 1946 Continental flew Denver to Kansas City, Wichita, Tulsa, and to Oklahoma City, and from El Paso and Albuquerque to San Antonio. Each route included stops in several of 22 smaller cities.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Continental began several interchange routes with American, Braniff, and United Airlines. Routes were operated on American from Los Angeles and San Francisco to El Paso continuing onto Continental's route to San Antonio and Houston.  Continental's Denver to Kansas City route would interchange onto St. Louis with Braniff Airways and United's routes from Seattle and Portland to Denver would interchange with Continental's routes onto Wichita and Tulsa. These interchange routes continued for many years until Continental was able to secure routes of its own between each city.\n\nIn 1955 Continental merged with [[Pioneer Air Lines]], gaining access to 16 more cities in Texas and New Mexico. In August 1953 Continental flew to 35 airports and Pioneer flew to 19, but Continental's network didn't reach beyond Denver, El Paso, Houston and Kansas City until April 1957 when it started Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles, two [[Douglas DC-7]]Bs a day each way. Pioneer's Executive Vice President [[Harding Lawrence|Harding Luther Lawrence]] arrived at Continental as a result of the merger. Bob Six commented on more than one occasion that, \"the reason we bought Pioneer was to get Harding.\" Harding Lawrence implemented several innovative changes at Continental as well as a flamboyant advertising campaign during his ten years as Six's protege. During Lawrence's tenure Continental grew by 500 percent. Lawrence left Continental in April 1965 to head [[Braniff Airways]].<ref name=UPI>{{cite web|last=United Press International|title=Airline Pioneer Harding Lawrence Dies|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/01/17/Airline-pioneer-Harding-Lawrence-dies/UPI-69351011319865/|work=United Press International|publisher=upi.com|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nSix petitioned the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB) for longer routes to larger cities, hoping to transform the regional into a trunkline like [[United Airlines]], [[TWA]], and [[American Airlines]]. He was discussing with [[Boeing]] for Continental to become one of the first to operate the soon-to-be-launched [[Boeing 707|707]]. The timing was crucial, since new routes would justify the 707s, and vice versa.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Robert F. Six, Chairman-CEO, Continental Airlines, 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Robert F. Six]], chairman-CEO, Continental Airlines, 1936\u20131981]]\n\nContinental Airlines had seen a broad expansion of its routes, thanks to a responsive CAB and persistent efforts by Six and Executive Vice President [[Harding Lawrence]] (who came to Continental in the Pioneer merger), who both frequently referred to his company as \"the Airline that needs to grow.\"<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\">Christian, J. Scott, former Continental employee and manager, Bring Songs to the Sky: Recollections of Continental Airlines, 1970\u20131986, Quadran Press, 1998.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} In 1958 Continental began turboprop flights with the [[Vickers Viscount]] on the new medium-haul routes. The CAB permitted Continental to drop service at many smaller cities, enabling the carrier's new aircraft to operate more economically on longer flights. In 1960 Continental flew more than three times the passenger-miles it had in 1956. (''Aviation Week'' June 22, 1959: \"Continental's current re-equipment program \u2014 involving a total cost of $64 million for the Boeings, Viscounts and DC-7Bs \u2014 was launched in 1955 when the carrier's net worth amounted to $5.5 million.\")\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s Six was the airline industry's leading lower-fare advocate. He predicted that increased traffic, not higher fares, was the answer to the airline industry's problems. To amazement from the industry he introduced the [[Economy class#Airlines|economy fare]] on the Chicago-Los Angeles route in 1962. He later pioneered a number of other low or discount fares which made air travel available to many who could not previously afford it. One of Continental's early innovations was a system-wide economy excursion fare which cut the standard coach fares by more than 25%.<ref name=\"Serling\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Continental took delivery of the first of five 707-124s in spring 1959, and started Chicago-Los Angeles nonstop on June 8.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Having so few jets, Continental needed radical innovations to the 707 maintenance program. It developed the \"progressive maintenance\" program, which enabled Continental to fly its 707 fleet seven days a week, achieving greater aircraft utilization than any other jet operator in the industry.<ref name=\"Serling\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Six, not being satisfied with 707 service, introduced innovations and luxe cuisine on Continental's 707 flights which were described as, \"...&nbsp;nothing short of luxurious\" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and, \"...&nbsp;clearly, the finest in the airline industry\" by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[File:Boeing 707-124 (Continental Airlines) LAX.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 707]] at Los Angeles, 1967]]\nIn the early 1960s Continental added flights from Los Angeles to Houston, nonstop as well as via Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Midland-Odessa, Austin, and/or San Antonio. In 1963 the company headquarters moved from Denver to Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Davies\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} By late 1963 Continental had discontinued service to most of its smaller cities in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas with the exception of Lawton, OK and Wichita Falls, TX which continued operating with DC-9 and 727 jets until 1977. Total passenger-miles in 1967 were more than five times greater than in 1960, but 61% of the 1967 total was on unscheduled flights (mostly transpacific charters). During the late 1960s the company disposed of the last of its turboprop and piston-powered aircraft\u2014one of the first U.S. airlines to do so.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> Continental replaced the Viscount fleet with [[Douglas DC-9-10]]s and then added [[Boeing 727-100]]s and [[727-200]]s.  The DC-9 and 727 were to become the workhorses of the fleet from the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> The DC-9s were phased out by the late 1970s (although the type reappeared after mergers in the 1980s with an example being [[Texas International Airlines]] DC-9s which were added to the CO fleet); the 727-200 was the mainstay of its narrow-body fleet until the late 1980s. In 1968 a new [[livery]] was launched: orange and gold cheatlines on a white fuselage; and a black \"jetstream\" logo (by Six's friend, the noted graphic designer [[Saul Bass]]) on the iconic \"Golden Tails\" of the airline's aircraft. The slogans adopted in 1968 and used for more than a decade were, \"The Airline That Pride Built\" and, \"The Proud Bird with the Golden Tail\".<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> 1960s saw international routes awarded to Continental (to New Zealand and Australia) in the Transpacific Case, but they were cancelled by the Nixon Administration.\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines B737-200 N7381F.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing 737-200 with 1968\u20131991 \"meatball\" logo and livery designed by [[Saul Bass]]]]\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] Continental provided extensive cargo and troop transportation for [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] forces to Asian and the Pacific bases.

On June 26, 1970, Continental became the second carrier (after TWA) to put the 747 into U.S. domestic service. Its upper-deck first class lounge and main deck \"Polynesian Pub\" won awards worldwide for the most refined cabin interior among all airlines, as did meal services developed by Continental's Cordon Bleu-trained executive chef, Lucien DeKeyser.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Continental's 747 services from Chicago and Denver to Los Angeles and Honolulu set the standard for service in the western U.S.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> On June 1, 1972, Continental's widebody [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] service began. Six had insisted that Continental place a large order for DC-10s with manufacturer [[McDonnell Douglas]]. This decision again proved prescient, since the publicity associated with Continental's splashy 747 service Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles-Honolulu had stimulated increased market share and increased traffic for all carriers. Denver, Houston and Seattle were growing rapidly in the 1970s; the DC-10s took over most flights between Denver and Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle, and between Houston and Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-224 N32718 CO ORD 19.02.78 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-224]] at [[Chicago O'Hare Airport]] in 1978]]\nDuring the 1970s, Denver served as the airline's main hub. The 747s were focused on the Chicago-Los Angeles-Honolulu routes, with one daily round trip through Denver. The DC-10s served large markets (Los Angeles to Chicago, Denver, Houston and Honolulu; and from Denver to Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Houston). DC-9s and 727s predominated elsewhere and added frequencies on DC-10 routes.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Next to [[Braniff]], Continental operated fewer aircraft types (four: the 747, DC-10, 727-200, and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9-10]]) during this period than any U.S. trunkline, affording savings in parts, maintenance, and crew training.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The DC-10 enabled the airline to capitalize on traffic growth in the west. Continental saw market share grow annually in each DC-10 market through the 1970s, until relative market parity was achieved with United, the principal competitor on most of the DC-10 routes. The same innovations introduced on the 747s appeared on Continental's DC-10s, including the \"Polynesian Pub\", but after the [[1973 oil crisis]] more seats were needed and the DC-10 pubs were removed.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Continental phased out its 747s in 1978 in favor of the DC-10s (747s would return to Continental during the Lorenzo era, flying Newark to London and Paris). From the late 1970s until it merged with Texas International, Continental operated only DC-10s and 727-200s.  In the very late seventies, prior to the merger, 727-100s were added.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1982, Continental was headquartered at the west end of the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] on World Way West. The facility included the general offices, system operations control, the central maintenance facility, flight kitchen, and Los Angeles crew bases.<ref name=\"Serling\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}<ref>''World Airline Directory''.

President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Civil Aeronautics Board chairman [[Alfred E. Kahn|Alfred Kahn]] had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry, which would dissolve the CAB and for the first time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without government supervision where they would fly, and how much they could charge. Continental began flights from Denver to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa/St. Petersburg in Florida. That year, President Carter authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between [[Air Micronesia]] destination [[Saipan]] and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via [[Honolulu]], [[American Samoa]], Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} After the 1978 passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] Continental embarked on a route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to Houston and Denver, and from Denver to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].<ref name=\"Scott\"/> That month Continental started DC-10 flights between Los Angeles and [[Taipei]], via Honolulu and [[Guam]]. Service between Houston and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979 Continental linked Denver with Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco and San Jose and also began Houston-Tampa service.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide. Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, so flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental's post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, with the corresponding expansion of facilities at both of these airports. In Denver, Continental's rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new [[Denver International Airport]], which would be completed almost fifteen years later.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines DC-10-10 N68042.jpg|thumb|left|Continental DC-10 at Narita Airport, Japan]]\nWhile deregulation allowed Continental to expand into new profitable areas, it hurt the company's existing business as consumers were for the first time able to choose lower fares over Continental's better service. In 1978 Continental explored the possibility of a merger with [[Western Airlines]], which held a nearby headquarters and similar fleet.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The route systems would have been complementary, with little overlap; although they both served the Western states, Continental had strength in Hawaii, southern-tier and the [[Great Plains]] states; Western's strengths were in the California intrastate market, Alaska, Mexico, and the [[Intermountain West]]. Both airlines served the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Rocky Mountain]] states, but along different routes from Los Angeles, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle and Phoenix. The merger did not take place.<ref name=\"Davies\"/><ref name=\"Scott\"/> Unlike some airlines (notably [[Braniff]] whose expansion was so rapid and unsustainable that the additional costs made investment recovery impossible, and the carrier was forced into bankruptcy and liquidation), Continental's expansion after passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] seems, in retrospect, to have been appropriate. The markets that were added were almost all profitable, absorbing some of the hits to its existing markets and helping it in difficult times between 1982 and 1994.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1981, [[Texas Air Corporation]], an airline holding company controlled by U.S. aviation entrepreneur [[Frank Lorenzo]], acquired Continental after a contentious battle with Continental's management who were determined to resist Lorenzo. Continental's labor unions also fiercely resisted, fearing what they termed as \"Lorenzo's deregulation tactics\", which they believed implied that he wanted to make Continental a non-union airline. Lorenzo viewed the company as stuck in the pre-deregulation era and in need of serious changes to stay competitive. Continental was experiencing financial challenges both before and after Lorenzo's takeover, and he demanded immediate wage cuts and layoffs to keep the company afloat.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\">{{cite book |author=Bamber, G.J. |author2=Gittell, J.H. |author3=Kochan, T.A. |author4=von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |chapter=Alternative Strategies for New Entrants: Southwest vs. Ryanair |isbn=978-0-8014-4747-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780801447471 }}</ref> During this struggle, Continental Airlines CEO, [[Alvin Feldman]], died from suicide in his office.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Continental Air Chief Dies, Apparent Suicide|work=New York Times|date=August 10, 1981|accessdate=July 16, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/10/us/continental-air-chief-dies-apparent-suicide.html?&pagewanted=print|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Lorenzo became Continental's new Chairman and CEO.

Chapter 11 saved the company from liquidation, but required substantial reorganization, which began immediately.

Additional service from Newark to London and Paris started after the airline's merger with People Express Airlines in 1987. However, the airline was still facing significant challenges with consistently low reliability rankings and a high level of customer complaints compared with its competitors.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\"/> In October 1985, Texas Air Corp. made an offer for a Denver-based regional carrier, [[Frontier Airlines (1950\u20131986)|Frontier Airlines]], opening a bidding war with [[People Express]], which was headed by Lorenzo's former TI associate [[Donald Burr|Don Burr]]. People Express paid a substantial premium for Frontier's high-cost operation. The acquisition, funded by debt, did not seem rational to industry observers from either the route integration or the operating philosophy points of view, but was in the opinion of most industry analysts rather an attempt by Burr to best his former boss, Lorenzo.<ref name=\"Scott\"/><ref name=\"Delaney\"/> On August 24, 1986, Frontier filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. With People Express hemorrhaging cash, Texas Air acquired People Express on September 15, 1986, at the same time gaining Frontier, whose strong network in the Great Plains and intermountain West reinforced Continental's already formidable Denver hub. Because it had been the largest airline operating in the New York market, the People Express hub at Newark would permit Continental to expand its East Coast services dramatically.

The majority of Continental flights were operated from its hubs, with a few exceptions (Seattle-Anchorage, Los Angeles-Honolulu, and Los Angeles-Havana, LaGuardia \u2013 Aruba). Some affiliated airlines used the [[Continental Connection]] name also operate flights not involving hubs, such as [[Gulfstream International Airlines]], which operated intra-Florida and Florida-Bahamas services.\n\n[[File:Terminal E Waiting area.jpg|thumb|Continental was the dominant operator at [[Houston Intercontinental Airport]]]]\n\nFor almost 40 years, Continental operated a very large hub in [[Denver]], Colorado, but took the decision to close that hub in 1995 immediately after the opening of [[Denver International Airport]] (DIA), which represented a significantly higher-cost operation than the former Stapleton Airport, which DIA had replaced. The abrupt nature of this change came as a shock to Denver, which was experiencing dramatic growth. The void left by Continental's departure allowed the establishment of the \"new\" [[Frontier Airlines]] (a startup, rather than the original carrier of that name). Both Frontier and Southwest Airlines (which entered the Denver market after Continental's dehubbing) have expanded quickly to fill the vacuum created by Continental's closing of its Denver hub.\n\nFor the first forty years of its existence, Continental was a domestic airline; however, especially after the incorporation of [[Texas International Airlines|Texas International]] routes, it has served more Mexican destinations than any other U.S. carrier since the mid-1980s.\n\nContinental first entered the transatlantic market in April 1985, with the introduction of a Houston-[[Gatwick Airport|London-Gatwick]] service. Long prevented from serving [[London Heathrow Airport]] because of the provisions of the [[Bermuda II]] agreement, which only allowed [[British Airways]], [[Virgin Atlantic]], [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] to operate flights from Heathrow to the United States, Continental maintained its London services at Gatwick, where in 2007 as many as six flights a day were offered to Newark, Houston, and Cleveland.\n\nIn March 2008, an [[Open Skies Agreement]] between the U.S. and the European Union became effective, invalidating Bermuda II restrictions that had limited the number of carriers and cities in the U.S. that could serve London-Heathrow. In November 2007 Continental announced that new, nonstop, twice-daily service from its hubs at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] and [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] to London-Heathrow would be offered; and this service was inaugurated on March 29, 2008. The service replaced existing frequencies to London-Gatwick and are offered with a combination of [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] and [[757-200]] equipment, with flat beds guaranteed in the BusinessFirst cabin.<ref>\"[https://archive.today/20120628230019/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=85779&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1078367&highlight= Continental Airlines to Launch Twice-Daily Nonstop Flights to Heathrow From Both New York and Houston]\", ''Continental Airlines''</ref> Continental has grown its presence at London-Heathrow to seven daily flights; two to Houston-Intercontinental and five to Newark.\n\n[[File:Bush terminal E.jpg|thumb|Continental operated international flights from Terminal E at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] in [[Houston]].]]\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], Continental's extensive military charter operations established a presence in the Pacific region that formed the basis for the [[Air Micronesia]] operation. Service to Japan was initiated in the 1970s from Guam and Saipan, and by the late 1980s, nonstop service between Seattle and Tokyo was briefly offered with [[Boeing 747|747]] equipment, soon to be replaced with a direct Honolulu-[[Narita International Airport|Tokyo (Narita)]] flight. Through the 1990s, Continental maintained a minimal presence in the long-haul trans-Pacific market, until the delivery of 777-200ERs in 1998 which saw the addition of nonstop Tokyo service from Houston and Newark. By 2007, Hong Kong and Beijing were added to the network, and in 2009 Shanghai was added, all from the Newark hub.

United repainted this aircraft to the standard Globe livery in May 2016, and then painted a different airframe in the Blue Skyway, sister ship N75435. The reason for the change is currently unknown to the public.\n\nFirst Class was offered on Domestic Flights, and BusinessFirst was offered on Transatlantic/Transpacific Flights.\n\nContinental Airlines was one of three carriers (with [[American Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]]) to sign an exclusivity agreement with Boeing in the late 1990s. When Boeing acquired [[McDonnell Douglas]], the European Union forced Boeing to void the contracts. Both parties had been adhering to the terms under a [[gentlemen's agreement]].\n\nContinental was one of the first major airlines to fly Boeing 757s on transatlantic routes. There have been some instances of range limitations on west-bound transatlantic flights due to strong headwinds resulting in a fuel stop which does not appear on the timetable, but these stops are not common. The use of the 757 with its smaller [[seating capacity]] allowed for \"thin\" routes (routes with less passenger traffic) to be economically viable. It allowed non-stop service from smaller cities, such as [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland and [[Hamburg]], Germany to the New York gateway. Previously, customers originating at these and similar cities needed to connect at European gateways like London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, or Frankfurt, in order to travel to New York. United retains a number of these flight routes, mostly based out of Newark, including Newark-Hamburg, Newark-Dublin, and Newark-Berlin.\n\n===Historic fleet===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''CAL, March 1960'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%200497.html |title=Flight International April 8, 1960 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 707\u2013120]]\n|4\n|1\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-3]]\n|10\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-6]]\n|1\n|0\n|Leased\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-6]]B\n|2\n|0\n|1 leased\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-7]]B\n|5\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Vickers Viscount|Vickers Viscount 812]]\n|15\n|\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''37'''\n|'''1'''\n|\n|}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''CAL, March 1970'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%200529.html |title=Flight International March 26, 1970 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Concorde]] ([[Supersonic transport|SST]])\n|0\n|3\n| Not delivered\n|-\n|[[Boeing 2707]] ([[Supersonic transport|SST]])\n|0\n|3\n| Not manufactured\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-320C]]\n|13\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707|Boeing 720B]]\n|8\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100C]]\n|1\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-200]]\n|12\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-100]]\n|0\n|4\n|\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9-10F]]\n|19\n|0\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''62'''\n|'''10'''\n|\n|}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ '''CAL, July 1980'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%201919.html|title=World Airline Directory 1980|publisher=Flight International |date=July 26, 1980|accessdate=December 11, 2011}}</ref>\n|-\n!Aircraft\n!Total\n!Orders\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100]]\n|16\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-200]]\n|36\n|9\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-10]]\n|7\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-10CF]]\n|6\n|0\n|\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10-30]]\n|0\n|2\n|\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''65'''\n|'''11'''\n|\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Cabin===\nContinental Airlines had a two-class service configuration, First/BusinessFirst and Economy Class, for aircraft in the mainline fleets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/default.aspx |title=Continental Airlines Aircraft Information |publisher=Continental.com |accessdate=May 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302102529/https://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/default.aspx |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====BusinessFirst====\nContinental had begun deploying BusinessFirst seats that allowed customers to lie completely flat, reclining 180-degrees and providing {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m}} of sleeping space in the fully extended position on its 777-200ER and 757-200 aircraft.

Installation on the [[Boeing 767]] fleet was to follow in 2011. The anticipated completion of the roll-out across Continental's entire international fleet was planned for August 2012. In addition, all 787 deliveries were to have the seats installed.\n\nContinental considered BusinessFirst to be its signature onboard product, and the service is a frequent subject of advertising campaigns. Customers seated in the BusinessFirst cabin on longhaul flights from the United States to Europe, Asia, select cities in South America, and the Middle East received special ground services, including EliteAccess priority bag service at check-in, expedited security screening (where available), access to Continental's Presidents Club or affiliated Star Alliance lounges, personalized Continental Concierge service, and dedicated boarding procedures.\n\n[[File:Continental Airlines BusinessFirst entree.jpg|thumb|In-flight meal in BusinessFirst]]\n\nOn board, multi-course meals were designed by Continental's Congress of Chefs, beverages were selected by Continental's Wine Masters, and service was provided by flight attendants from separate International crew bases at Newark and Houston. Most flights had at least two meal services. Entertainment was offered at each individual seat, and passengers on Boeing 777 and 757 aircraft had access to a new Audio-Video On Demand system with touch-screen controls. 767 aircraft featured older, looped-video multi-channel entertainment systems, generally with a wider programming selection than Economy Class. 767 aircraft were expected to receive AVOD in the near future. Customers also were provided headphones, a large pillow, wool blanket, and amenity kit prior to departure. Upon arrival, BusinessFirst customers have access to shower facilities and arrival lounges at most airports.\n\nContinental offered a modified BusinessFirst service on flights from the United States mainland to Hawaii. All flights offered the same suite of EliteAccess ground services, along with a similar main meal service on board. Amenities such as pillows and headsets also were the same, but no amenity kits were offered. On flights from Newark and Houston to Honolulu, Continental operated Boeing 767-400ER aircraft with typical recliner-style BusinessFirst seats. On flights from Los Angeles and Orange County to Honolulu/Kahului with [[Boeing 737]] equipment, domestic First Class seats were substituted. Nonstop flights from Guam to Honolulu were exempt from most of these modifications and more closely resembled the standard BusinessFirst service.\n\nNo complimentary upgrades were offered to Continental OnePass Elite members on any intercontinental flights offering BusinessFirst service. However, on 767-operated BusinessFirst services to Hawaii, Continental offered a day-of-departure buy up fee for any revenue coach class fare, provided seats were available. Mainland-Hawaii was the only BusinessFirst market where such upgrades are available. In addition, OnePass Elites were eligible for complimentary automatic upgrades on Continental-operated flights from California to Hawaii.\n[[File:Continental Airlines domestic First Class dinner.jpg|thumb|left|Domestic First Class dinner]]\n\n====Domestic First Class====\nDomestic First Class was offered on domestic flights.

When AF4590 subsequently departed, Concorde's left main landing gear tires struck the strip of metal and were punctured.
