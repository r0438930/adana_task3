Molasses comprises 10% of brown sugar's total weight,<ref name=\"figoni.fundamentals.baking.science\" /> which is about one ninth of the white sugar weight. Due to varying qualities and colors of molasses products,<ref name=\"figoni.fundamentals.baking.science\" /> for lighter or darker sugar, reduce or increase its proportion according to taste.\n\nIn following a modern recipe that specifies \"brown sugar\", one usually may assume that the intended meaning is light brown sugar, but which one prefers is largely a matter of taste. Even in recipes such as cakes, where the moisture content might be critical, the amount of water involved is too small to matter. More importantly, adding dark brown sugar or molasses will impart a stronger flavor, with more of a suggestion of caramel.\n\nBrown sugar that has hardened can be made soft again by adding a new source of moisture for the molasses, or by heating and remelting the molasses. Storing brown sugar in a freezer will prevent moisture from escaping and molasses from crystallizing, allowing for a much longer shelf life.\n\n==Nutritional value==\n{{nutritionalvalue|name = Sugar (sucrose), brown (with molasses)|kJ=1576|protein=0 g|fat= 0 g|carbs = 97.33 g|sugars=96.21 g|fiber = 0 g|thiamin_mg=0.008|riboflavin_mg=0.007|niacin_mg=0.082|folate_ug=1|vitB6_mg=0.026|calcium_mg=85|iron_mg=1.91|magnesium_mg=29|phosphorus_mg=22|potassium_mg=133|sodium_mg=39|zinc_mg=0.18|water=1.77 g|right=1|note=[https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6318 Full link to USDA database entry]}}\n{{nutritionalvalue|name = Sugar (sucrose), granulated|kJ=1619|protein=0 g|fat= 0 g|carbs = 99.98 g|sugars=99.91 g|fiber = 0 g|riboflavin_mg=0.019|calcium_mg=1|iron_mg=0.01|potassium_mg=2|water=0.03 g|right=1|note=[https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6319 Full link to USDA database entry]}}\nOne hundred grams of brown sugar contains 377 [[Calories]] (nutrition table), as opposed to 387 Calories in white [[sugar]] (link to nutrition table).

Due to varying qualities and colors of molasses products,<ref name=\"figoni.fundamentals.baking.science\" /> for lighter or darker sugar, reduce or increase its proportion according to taste.\n\nIn following a modern recipe that specifies \"brown sugar\", one usually may assume that the intended meaning is light brown sugar, but which one prefers is largely a matter of taste. Even in recipes such as cakes, where the moisture content might be critical, the amount of water involved is too small to matter. More importantly, adding dark brown sugar or molasses will impart a stronger flavor, with more of a suggestion of caramel.\n\nBrown sugar that has hardened can be made soft again by adding a new source of moisture for the molasses, or by heating and remelting the molasses. Storing brown sugar in a freezer will prevent moisture from escaping and molasses from crystallizing, allowing for a much longer shelf life.\n\n==Nutritional value==\n{{nutritionalvalue|name = Sugar (sucrose), brown (with molasses)|kJ=1576|protein=0 g|fat= 0 g|carbs = 97.33 g|sugars=96.21 g|fiber = 0 g|thiamin_mg=0.008|riboflavin_mg=0.007|niacin_mg=0.082|folate_ug=1|vitB6_mg=0.026|calcium_mg=85|iron_mg=1.91|magnesium_mg=29|phosphorus_mg=22|potassium_mg=133|sodium_mg=39|zinc_mg=0.18|water=1.77 g|right=1|note=[https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6318 Full link to USDA database entry]}}\n{{nutritionalvalue|name = Sugar (sucrose), granulated|kJ=1619|protein=0 g|fat= 0 g|carbs = 99.98 g|sugars=99.91 g|fiber = 0 g|riboflavin_mg=0.019|calcium_mg=1|iron_mg=0.01|potassium_mg=2|water=0.03 g|right=1|note=[https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6319 Full link to USDA database entry]}}\nOne hundred grams of brown sugar contains 377 [[Calories]] (nutrition table), as opposed to 387 Calories in white [[sugar]] (link to nutrition table). However, brown sugar packs more densely than white sugar due to the smaller crystal size and may have more calories when measured by volume.\n\nAny minerals present in brown sugar come from the molasses added to the white sugar. In a 100-gram reference amount, brown sugar contains 15% of the [[Daily Value]] for [[iron]], with no other vitamins or minerals in significant content (table).\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Brown sugar}}\n* [[Caramelization]]\n* ''[[Peen tong]]'' \u2013 a Chinese brown sugar and candy\n*[[Sugar industry|Sugar Industry]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Sugar}}\n\n[[Category:Sugar]]\n\n[[ja:\u9ed2\u7802\u7cd6]]\n", "name_user": "Dough34", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNatural brown sugar:add links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_sugar"}
