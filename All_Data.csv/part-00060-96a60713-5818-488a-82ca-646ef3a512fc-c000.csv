'''''I Will Mention the Loving-kindnesses''''' is an [[anthem]] for [[Easter]] by [[Arthur Sullivan]]. The text is taken from the [[Book of Isaiah]], scored for solo tenor, mixed choir and organ. It was published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] in 1875, dedicated to [[John Stainer]].

== History ==
Sullivan was a boy chorister at the [[Chapel Royal]] from 1854 to 1857.<ref name=\"GS church\" /> There, he began to write anthems and songs.<ref name=\"Jacobs\" />{{rp|10–11}} He then studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]<ref name=\"GS church\" /> and the [[Musikhochschule Leipzig]], returning to England in 1861. From 1861 to 1872, while beginning his professional composing career, he worked as a [[church organist]] at two fashionable London churches: [[St. Michael's Church, Chester Square]], [[Pimlico]], and St. Peter's, Cranley Gardens, [[Kensington]].<ref name=grove>Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/27100  \"Sullivan, Sir Arthur\"], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford University Press, accessed 19 August 2011 {{subscription}}</ref><ref name=\"Bradley\" />{{rp|55–57}} Between 1861 and 1875, Sullivan composed a wide range of music, including [[incidental music]] for plays, a ballet, a symphony, a cello concerto, concert overtures, a cantata, an oratorio, several operettas, a song cycle, and numerous hymns, parlour ballads and other pieces.<ref name=\"Jacobs\" />{{rp|19–76}}

Anthems were in demand in a period of choral revival in the second half of the 19th century, for smaller churches, rather than cathedrals, which still favoured [[Tudor music]]. Sullivan composed 16 published anthems, most of them during his work as church organist.<ref name=\"Bradley\" />{{rp|145–147}} For a text of this 1875 [[Easter]] anthem, Sullivan combined passages from Isaiah, verses [[s:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#63:7|63:7-9, 14-16]].<ref name=\"GS archive\" />

\"I Will Mention the Loving-kindnesses\" was published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] in 1875,<ref name=\"GS archive\" /> with a dedication to his friend, the music director [[John Stainer]].<ref name=\"Score\" /> This was the same year that [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s first box-office success, ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', premiered in London.<ref name=\"Ainger\" />

== Text and music ==
Sullivan set a text from the [[Old Testament]] which praises in general God's friendly attitude towards his people (in Hebrew: [[Chesed]]), guiding and saving them. The anthem is set for tenor solo, a four part choir and organ. It begins in [[G major]] and [[common time]], marked ''Andante''. After a few measures from the organ, the tenor begins with the fist line, repeated with the same melody in a [[Homophony|homophonic]] choral setting.<ref name=\"Score\" /> This responsorial pattern is kept for several lines of the text.<ref name=\"Score\" /> Then the tenor sings a longer line alone, and the choir responds with a repeat of the first line.
The tenor continues with the line \"So He said: Surely they are my people, children that will not lie:\", and the following \"So He was their Redeemer\", which can be interpreted as the message of Easter, is set for the choir, singing softly in [[unison]] even long notes, with no movement even in the accompaniment.<ref name=\"Score\" /> It is followed by a repetition of the first-line music from the organ.<ref name=\"Score\" />

The following text, calling to praise God, begins in the solo tenor, followed by the men's voices, and then the whole choir. It [[Modulation (music)|modulates]] to [[E major]] with a crescendo.<ref name=\"Score\" /> The last section is for the choir, singing mostly in homophony, and ending with long-held chords on several Amens.<ref name=\"Score\" />

'''Marie-Alphonse-Nicolas-Joseph Jongen''' (14 December 1873 – 12 July 1953) was a Belgian [[organist]], [[composer]], and [[music]] [[educator]].

==Biography==
Jongen was born in [[Liège]], where his parents had moved from Flanders. On the strength of an amazing precocity for music, he was admitted to the Liège Conservatoire at the extraordinarily young age of seven, and spent the next sixteen years there. Jongen won a First Prize for Fugue in 1895, an honors diploma in piano the next year, and another for organ in 1896. In 1897, he won the Belgian [[Prix de Rome (Belgium)|Prix de Rome]], which allowed him to travel to Italy, Germany and France.

He began composing at the age of 13, and immediately exhibited exceptional talent in that field too. By the time he published his Opus 1, he already had dozens of works to his credit. His monumental and massive First String Quartet was composed in 1894 and was submitted for the annual competition for fine arts held by the Royal Academy of Belgium, where it was awarded the top prize by the jury.

In 1902, he returned to his native land, and in the following year he was named a professor of [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]] at his old Liège college. With the outbreak of [[World War I]], he and his family moved to England, where he founded a piano quartet. When peace returned, he came back to Belgium and was named professor of [[fugue]] at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]]. From 1925 until 1939, he served as director of that institution; he was succeeded by his brother [[Léon Jongen]]. Fourteen years after leaving the directorship, Joseph Jongen died at [[Sart-lez-Spa]], Belgium.

==Compositions==
From his teens to his seventies Jongen composed a great deal, including [[symphony|symphonies]], [[concerto]]s (for cello, for piano and for harp), [[chamber music]] (notably a late [[string trio]] and three [[string quartet]]s), and songs, some with piano, others with orchestra. (His list of opus numbers eventually reached 241, but he destroyed many pieces.) Today, the only part of his ''oeuvre'' performed with any regularity is his output for organ, much of it solo, some of it in combination with other instruments.

His monumental ''Symphonie Concertante'' of 1926 is a ''tour de force'', considered by many to be among the greatest works ever written for organ and orchestra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laphil.com/music/piece_detail.cfm?id=1466|title=Symphonie concertante|website=www.laphil.com}}</ref> Numerous eminent organists of modern times (such as [[Virgil Fox]], [[Alexander Frey]], [[Jean Guillou]], [[Michael Murray (organist)|Michael Murray]] and [[Olivier Latry]]) have championed and recorded it. The work was commissioned by [[Rodman Wanamaker]] for debut in the Grand Court of his palatial Philadelphia department store, [[Wanamaker's]]. Its intended use was for the re-dedication of the world's largest pipe organ there, the [[Wanamaker Organ]], as part of a series of concerts Rodman Wanamaker funded with [[Leopold Stokowski]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].  Wanamaker's death in 1928 precluded the performance of the work at that time in the venue for which it was written, but it was finally performed for the first time with the Wanamaker Organ and the Philadelphia Orchestra on 27 September 2008.

In 1945, Jongen composed the [[Mass, Op. 130]], for choir, brass and organ, in memory of his brother Alphonse.

The carvings date back as far as the 7th century AD, depicting and influenced by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Confucius|Confucian]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] beliefs.  Some are in rock-cut cave shrines, in the usual Chinese Buddhist style, but many others are [[rock reliefs]] carved into the open rock faces.

==World Heritage Site==
Listed as a [[World Heritage Site]], the Dazu Rock Carvings are made up of 75 protected sites containing some 50,000 statues, with over 100,000 Chinese characters forming inscriptions and epigraphs. The sites are located in [[Chongqing Municipality]] within the steep hillsides throughout [[Dazu County]], located about 165 kilometers west of the urban area of Chongqing. The highlights of the rock grotto are found on [[Mount Baoding]] and Mount Beishan.

The carvings were listed as a World Heritage Site in 1999, citing \"''…their aesthetic quality, their rich diversity of subject matter, both secular and religious, and the light that they shed on everyday life in China during this period. They provide outstanding evidence of the harmonious synthesis of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism.''\"<ref>{{cite web| url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/912 | title=Dazu Rock Carvings | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | accessdate=21 September 2014 }}</ref>

==History==
The earliest carvings were begun in 650 AD during the early [[Tang dynasty]], but the main period of their creation began in the late 9th century, when Wei Junjing, [[Prefect]] of [[Changzhou]], pioneered the carvings on Mount Beishan, and his example was followed after the collapse of the Tang dynasty by local and gentry, monks and nuns, and ordinary people during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] (907-65). In the 12th century, during the [[Song dynasty]], a Buddhist monk named Zhao Zhifeng began work on the elaborate sculptures and carvings on Mount Baoding, dedicating 70 years of his life to the project.

Off limits to visitors for many years, the carvings were opened to Chinese travellers in 1961 and foreign visitors in 1980.  Until 1975, there was only a muddy path between the town of Dazu and the main cluster of carvings.  The isolation helped keep the art unharmed during the massive anti-religious vandalism of the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref name=\"NYTcr\">{{cite newspaper| first=Ross | last=Terrill | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9C0CE6DA123FF937A25752C0A966958260 | title=Serene Haven of Buddhist Art | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 14, 1990 | accessdate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref>

'''Ingvar Jónsson''' (born 18 October 1989) is an Icelandic [[Association football|football]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] who plays for [[Knattspyrnufélagið Víkingur|Víkingur Reykjavík]] and the [[Iceland national football team|Iceland national team]]. He made his senior debut in 2014, earning 8 caps for Iceland and was selected for [[Euro 2016]] as an unused member.

==Club career==
Ingvar started his career with local club [[Ungmennafélag Njarðvíkur|Njarðvík]] before moving to [[Stjarnan]] in the [[Úrvalsdeild]] before the 2011 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/frettir/forsida/2010/11/05/ingvar_valdi_stjornuna/|title=Ingvar valdi Stjörnuna|work=mbl.is|accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref> With Stjarnan he won the [[2014 Úrvalsdeild]] and was after the season voted by his fellow players the best player of the 2014 Úrvalsdeild.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/sport/efstadeild/2014/10/20/ingvar_gridarlega_stoltur/|title=Ingvar: Gríðarlega stoltur|work=mbl.is|accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref> Stjarnan also had a good Europa League run in 2014, advancing past [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]], [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[Lech Poznań]] before losing to [[Inter Milan]] in the play-off round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2015/clubs/club=52308/matches/index.html|title=UEFA Europa League 2014/15 - History - Stjarnan – UEFA.com|last=uefa.com|work=uefa.com|accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref>

In 2015, he joined [[IK Start]], but could not secure the first spot in competition with [[Håkon Opdal]]. In the summer transfer window, he thus joined [[Sandnes Ulf]] on loan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fvn.no/sport/xfotball/start/Han-er-ny-Start-keeper-2852204.html|title=Han er ny Start-keeper|last=Stenersen|first=Steffen|date=15 July 2015|work=[[Fædrelandsvennen]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref>

After one and a half year at Danish club [[Viborg IF]], Jónsson left the club at the end of 2019.<ref>[https://www.vff.dk/nyheder2/frontpagenews/11736-vff-tager-afsked-med-ingvar-jonsson VFF tager afsked med Ingvar Jónsson], vff.dk, 4 December 2019</ref>

On the 18th of January 2020 it was announced that Ingvar Jónsson would join [[Knattspyrnufélagið Víkingur|Víkingur]], signing a three-year contract.

==International career==
Ingvar made his first international appearance on 12 November 2014 in a match against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], when he came on as a substitute for [[Ögmundur Kristinsson (footballer, born 1989)|Ögmundur Kristinsson]] at half-time.<ref name=\"mbl\">{{cite web | url=http://www.mbl.is/sport/efstadeild/2014/11/12/tveggja_marka_tap_gegn_belgum_ytra/ |title=Tveggja marka tap gegn Belgum ytra |accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>

He was selected for [[EURO 2016]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksi.is/landslid/nr/13334 |title=A karla – Lokahópur fyrir EM 2016 |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=10 May 2016 |language=Icelandic |publisher=Knattspyrnusamband Íslands |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512081400/http://www.ksi.is/landslid/nr/13334 |archivedate=12 May 2016}}</ref>

Ingvar started his career with local club [[Ungmennafélag Njarðvíkur|Njarðvík]] before moving to [[Stjarnan]] in the [[Úrvalsdeild]] before the 2011 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/frettir/forsida/2010/11/05/ingvar_valdi_stjornuna/|title=Ingvar valdi Stjörnuna|work=mbl.is|accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref> With Stjarnan he won the [[2014 Úrvalsdeild]] and was after the season voted by his fellow players the best player of the 2014 Úrvalsdeild.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/sport/efstadeild/2014/10/20/ingvar_gridarlega_stoltur/|title=Ingvar: Gríðarlega stoltur|work=mbl.is|accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref> Stjarnan also had a good Europa League run in 2014, advancing past [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]], [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[Lech Poznań]] before losing to [[Inter Milan]] in the play-off round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2015/clubs/club=52308/matches/index.html|title=UEFA Europa League 2014/15 - History - Stjarnan – UEFA.com|last=uefa.com|work=uefa.com|accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref>

The '''ME Four-Twelve''' is an American high-performance [[concept car]] engineered, developed and produced by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] in 2004. The name is a combination of the [[mid-engine design|'''M'''id-'''E'''ngine]] with '''[[turbocharged petrol engines#quad-turbo|Four]]''' [[turbocharger]]s on a [[V12 engine|'''Twelve'''-cylinder]] engine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grabianowski |first=Ed |title=How the Chrysler ME Four-Twelve Works |date=27 May 2004 |work=HowStuffWorks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chrysler-concept.htm |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref>

==Background==
There were two ME Four-Twelve vehicles produced.<ref name=\"jalopnik\">{{cite web|url= http://jalopnik.com/the-chrysler-me-four-twelve-could-have-been-one-of-amer-1412737412 |title=The Chrysler ME Four-Twelve Could Have Been One Of America's Greatest |first=Patrick |last=George |date=27 September 2013 |work=Jalopnik |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> The first was an auto show version using performance expertise from Daimler, but with limited operational capabilities. It was designed behind-the-scenes during 2003 by a small team.<ref name=\"allpar\">{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/me412.html |title=The Chrysler ME Four Twelve |work=Allpar |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> The auto show vehicle, unveiled at the 2004 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, took less than one year for design and development. The exterior design was done by American Brian Nielander.<ref name=\"allpar\"/>

Chrysler announced at the 2004 NAIAS that the ME Four-Twelve was a full running prototype.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/chrysler-me-four-twelve-auto-shows |title=Chrysler ME Four-Twelve 2004 North American International Auto Show |date=January 2004 |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> At the time, key personnel within the Street & Racing Technology group at Chrysler directed by Dan Knott (also responsible for the [[Dodge Viper]], SRT production adaptations such as the [[Dodge Neon SRT-4]] and [[Dodge Ram SRT-10]], Dodge Motorsports, and Mopar performance parts) were alerted that another project was being considered; to design and build a fully engineered and functional prototype demonstration vehicle capable of achieving the published performance claims and being available for media track evaluation by the summer of 2004.<ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0411_chrysler_me_four_twelve_prototype/ |title=Road Test: Chrysler ME Four-Twelve Prototype Move over, Ferrari, here comes... Chrysler |first=Angus |last=MacKenzie |date=November 2004 |magazine=Motor Trend |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref>

==Design==
The chassis tub of the ME Four-Twelve is carbon-fiber and aluminum honeycomb.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N10vBCR0dPMC&pg=PA186&dq=Chrysler+ME+Four-Twelve&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RmKOVYXDJYbWU63coqAF&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q |pages=186–187 |title=Exotic Cars |first=John |last=Lamm |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2008 |isbn=9781616730734 |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> It uses a 4130 steel rear subframe and aluminum castings. The body is lightweight [[carbon fiber]]. The low profile of the vehicle contributes to its aerodynamics, while multiple air-intakes enhance cooling. The car uses 265/35ZR19 tires in the front and 335/30ZR20 tires in the rear (on 19- and 20-inch cast aluminium wheels, respectively). The brakes are six-piston-calipers with 16-inch discs at the front and back.

The modified 6.0&nbsp;L aluminum [[Mercedes-Benz M120 engine|Mercedes-Benz M120]] [[V12 engine]] featured a newly developed cylinder head, special intake and exhaust manifolds, as well as forged internals such as pistons and crankshaft to accommodate the forced induction system (i.e., four turbochargers),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/me412.html|title=Chrysler ME Four Twelve concept car|publisher=}}</ref> which brought the output of the engine to an astounding {{convert|850|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. This would have made it the most powerful, as well as the fastest, road-going production vehicle at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/the-chrysler-me-four-twelve-could-have-been-one-of-amer-1412737412|title=The Chrysler ME Four-Twelve Could Have Been One Of America's Greatest|author=Patrick George|work=Jalopnik}}</ref>  The seven-speed transmission is a [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential]] [[Dual clutch transmission|dual-clutch]] [[semi-automatic transmission| automated manual transmission]]<ref>[[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15133234/chrysler-me-four-twelve-auto-shows/ Chrysler ME Four-Twelve - Car and Driver]]</ref>, with the capability of shifting gears in 200 milliseconds. Claimed acceleration from 0-60&nbsp;mph is 2.9 seconds, and 0-100&nbsp;mph in 6.2 seconds. It can cover a quarter mile in 10.6 seconds, with a trap speed of {{convert|136|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Estimated top speed was claimed to be {{convert|248|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"jalopnik\"/>

The ME 412's interior features leather seats, a carbon fiber dashboard, and a chrome covered center console with a leather tilt steering wheel, and gunmetal gauges. Other features include dual-zone climate control, a premium audio system, keyless access, and a push button start system. The roof is [[Sunroof|made of glass]].

The name is a combination of the [[mid-engine design|'''M'''id-'''E'''ngine]] with '''[[turbocharged petrol engines#quad-turbo|Four]]''' [[turbocharger]]s on a [[V12 engine|'''Twelve'''-cylinder]] engine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grabianowski |first=Ed |title=How the Chrysler ME Four-Twelve Works |date=27 May 2004 |work=HowStuffWorks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chrysler-concept.htm |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref>

==Background==
There were two ME Four-Twelve vehicles produced.<ref name=\"jalopnik\">{{cite web|url= http://jalopnik.com/the-chrysler-me-four-twelve-could-have-been-one-of-amer-1412737412 |title=The Chrysler ME Four-Twelve Could Have Been One Of America's Greatest |first=Patrick |last=George |date=27 September 2013 |work=Jalopnik |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> The first was an auto show version using performance expertise from Daimler, but with limited operational capabilities. It was designed behind-the-scenes during 2003 by a small team.<ref name=\"allpar\">{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/me412.html |title=The Chrysler ME Four Twelve |work=Allpar |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> The auto show vehicle, unveiled at the 2004 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, took less than one year for design and development. The exterior design was done by American Brian Nielander.<ref name=\"allpar\"/>

Chrysler announced at the 2004 NAIAS that the ME Four-Twelve was a full running prototype.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/chrysler-me-four-twelve-auto-shows |title=Chrysler ME Four-Twelve 2004 North American International Auto Show |date=January 2004 |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> At the time, key personnel within the Street & Racing Technology group at Chrysler directed by Dan Knott (also responsible for the [[Dodge Viper]], SRT production adaptations such as the [[Dodge Neon SRT-4]] and [[Dodge Ram SRT-10]], Dodge Motorsports, and Mopar performance parts) were alerted that another project was being considered; to design and build a fully engineered and functional prototype demonstration vehicle capable of achieving the published performance claims and being available for media track evaluation by the summer of 2004.<ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0411_chrysler_me_four_twelve_prototype/ |title=Road Test: Chrysler ME Four-Twelve Prototype Move over, Ferrari, here comes...

==Design==
The chassis tub of the ME Four-Twelve is carbon-fiber and aluminum honeycomb.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N10vBCR0dPMC&pg=PA186&dq=Chrysler+ME+Four-Twelve&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RmKOVYXDJYbWU63coqAF&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q |pages=186–187 |title=Exotic Cars |first=John |last=Lamm |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2008 |isbn=9781616730734 |accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> It uses a 4130 steel rear subframe and aluminum castings. The body is lightweight [[carbon fiber]]. The low profile of the vehicle contributes to its aerodynamics, while multiple air-intakes enhance cooling. The car utilises 265/35ZR19 tires in the front and 335/30ZR20 tires in the rear (on 19- and 20-inch cast aluminium wheels, respectively). The brakes are six-piston-calipers with 16-inch discs at the front and back.

The modified 6.0&nbsp;L aluminum [[Mercedes-Benz M120 engine|Mercedes-Benz M120]] [[V12 engine]] featured a newly developed cylinder head, special intake and exhaust manifolds, as well as forged internals such as pistons and crankshaft to accommodate the forced induction system (i.e., four turbochargers),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/me412.html|title=Chrysler ME Four Twelve concept car|publisher=}}</ref> which brought the output of the engine to an astounding {{convert|850|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. This would have made it the most powerful, as well as the fastest, road-going production vehicle at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/the-chrysler-me-four-twelve-could-have-been-one-of-amer-1412737412|title=The Chrysler ME Four-Twelve Could Have Been One Of America's Greatest|author=Patrick George|work=Jalopnik}}</ref>  The seven-speed transmission is a [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential]] [[Dual clutch transmission|dual-clutch]] [[semi-automatic transmission| automated manual transmission]]<ref>[[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15133234/chrysler-me-four-twelve-auto-shows/ Chrysler ME Four-Twelve - Car and Driver]]</ref>, with the capability of shifting gears in 200 milliseconds. Claimed acceleration from 0-60&nbsp;mph is 2.9 seconds, and 0-100&nbsp;mph in 6.2 seconds. It can cover a quarter mile in 10.6 seconds, with a trap speed of {{convert|136|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Estimated top speed was claimed to be {{convert|248|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"jalopnik\"/>

The ME 412's interior features leather seats, a carbon fiber dashboard, and a chrome covered center console with a leather tilt steering wheel, and gunmetal gauges. Other features include dual-zone climate control, a premium audio system, keyless access, and a push button start system. The roof is [[Sunroof|made of glass]].

'''''Le Petit Parisien''''' was a prominent French newspaper during the [[French Third Republic]]. It was published between 1876 and 1944, and its circulation was over two million after the [[First World War]].

==Publishing==
Despite its name, the paper was circulated across France, and records showed claims that it had the biggest newspaper circulation in the world at this time.<ref>[http://www.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/chan/chan/pdf/ARASAQ/11AR.pdf {{in lang|fr}} Fonds du Petit Parisien, [[Archives nationales (France)|Archives nationales]] (French national archives)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929074017/http://www.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/chan/chan/pdf/ARASAQ/11AR.pdf |date=29 September 2006 }}</ref> In May 1927, the paper fell into a [[media prank]] set up by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and his friends, announcing that [[Charles Lindbergh]] was going to be awarded as ''[[École Normale Supérieure]]'' honorary student.<ref>Hayman, Ronald (1987) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCpBAQAAIAAJ ''Sartre: a life''] pp.69, 318</ref> During the [[Second World War]] the paper, under the editorship of [[Claude Jeantet]], was the official voice of the [[Vichy regime]] and in 1944 was briefly published by Jeantet in [[Nazi Germany]] before closing down.<ref>[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', 1990, p. 198</ref>

==Background==
Prior to the twentieth century, newspapers were largely political such as Paris's [[La Presse (French newspaper)|''La Presse'']]. This is largely because newspapers held close ties with political parties in order to profit. However, this led to a stunt in circulation. The creation of Joseph Pulitzer's newspaper [[Le Matin (France)|''Le Matin'']] inspired a new type of journalism. It prompted the start of [[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|''Le Petit Journal'']] and ''Le Petit Parisien'' which launched French journalism into a mass medium. These newspapers offered sensationalized news rather than relying on political propaganda which also meant they avoided the tax held on most political newspapers. This new style, reporting on topics such as finance and fashion, targeted mid to lower class readers. Appealing to this demographic helped launch ''Le Petit Parisien''{{’}}s circulation to the millions.<ref name=\"auto\">Eaman, Ross. ''Historical Dictionary of Journalism''. Scarecrow Press, 2009.</ref>

==Illustration==
''Le Petit Parisien'' featured a weekly, Sunday illustration located on their front pages. These illustrations were often visual representation of current events and paired with an article located within the newspaper. Because photography was not readily available, the newspaper relied on local artists to provide drawings and sketches for human interest stories. The purpose of these illustrated covers was to capture the eye of the passerby. Some illustrations are noted as risqué or scandalous, with the intentional use of getting the attention of readers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women in Bed with Snakes and Other News.

==Writers==
Up until the mid twentieth century, there was no formal school for journalism in Europe.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Therefore, the writers for ''Le Petit Parisien'' had no journalism education and were often activists and elite authors with many areas of expertise. Among the newspaper's guest writers was international correspondent [[Andrée Viollis]].<ref>Brunazzi, Elizabeth. \"Andrée Viollis: A ‘Grand Reporter’ in the Intellectual Resistance, 1942−1944.\" ''French Cultural Studies'' 22, no. 3 (1 August 2011): 229–37. {{doi|10.1177/0957155811408815}}.</ref>

During the interwar years, the heavy swap of editors suggests that ''Le Petit Parisien'' was suffering the effects of unregulated media ownership that plagued France until the 1980s.<ref>Eaman, Ross.

The '''James B. Duke House''' is a mansion located at 1 East 78th Street, on the northeast corner of [[Fifth Avenue]], on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The house is one of the great extant mansions from \"[[Millionaire's Row]]\". It was built for [[James Buchanan Duke]], who was one of the founding partners of [[American Tobacco Company]] and the owner of [[Duke Power]]. The building has housed the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts]] since 1952.

== History ==
In designing the house, the architect [[Horace Trumbauer]] drew heavily upon the design of French architect [[Etienne Laclotte]]'s [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Labotti%C3%A8re Château Labottière], built in 1773 at 16 Rue de Tivoli in [[Bordeaux]].<ref>Dolkart 1995; [http://membres.multimania.fr/monumentsgironde/Bordeaux.htm Hôtel Labottière, Bordeaux] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013070225/http://membres.multimania.fr/monumentsgironde/Bordeaux.htm |date=2012-10-13 }}</ref> Trumbauer copied almost verbatim Laclotte's projecting central bay and pediment; stacked columns in antis; bracketed cornice; attic balustrade; and [[Rustication (architecture)|channeled rustication]]. Duke purchased the site in August 1909 and construction completed in 1912. Three members of the Duke family—James B., his wife Nanaline, and their daughter [[Doris Duke|Doris]]—lived there with their staff part of the year. 

In January 1958, Nanaline and Doris Duke donated the building to [[New York University]]'s [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts|Institute of Fine Arts]], after which the architect [[Robert Venturi]] renovated the building for academic use. The main reception rooms on the ground floor retain many of the original furnishings and decorations, while the Institute's library and faculty offices now occupy the eight bedrooms of the second floor and the servants' quarters on the third floor.<ref name=\"nrhpinv_ny\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=5596|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: James B. Duke House|date=September 1976|accessdate=2011-03-25 |author=Elizabeth Ralph|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}} ''See also:'' {{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=5597|title=Accompanying three photos}}</ref>

A Landmarks of New York plaque was erected in 1959 by the New York Community Trust. After a public hearing held on March 30, 1970, the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the house a landmark on September 15, 1970, calling it “one of the adornments of Fifth Avenue and one of the last reminders of the Age of Elegance.” The house was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1977.<ref name=\"nris\"/>

==Film location==
The house has been used as a film location on several occasions, such as the engagement party scene in the 1981 film ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]''. In March 2007, the [[Pilot (Dirty Sexy Money)|pilot]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s drama ''[[Dirty Sexy Money]]'' was filmed there. In 2017, interior shots for the film ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'' were filmed there. In 2018, scenes for the film ''[[The Goldfinch (film)|The Goldfinch]]'' were filmed there.

A plateau is an elevated plain in [[Almaty]] region, [[Kazakhstan]],  with a flat or undulating slightly dissected surface, bounded by distinct ledges from neighboring plains. In places where the earth's crust slowly rises or where mountainous land areas are destroyed for a long time, a plateau is formed. On the Northern slopes of the [[Zailiysky Alatau]] mountains, the [[Mynzhylki]] mountain plateau is located at the source of the [[Malaya Almaatinka]] river at an altitude of 3000 meters above sea level. Translated from the [[Kazakh language]], '''''Means a thousand mares'''''. That is, a place suitable for grazing many horses. From Mynzhylki you can climb to the glaciological station [[Tuyuksu]]-1 (3400 m), to [[Alpengrad]] (3450 m), from where climbers make ascents to the peaks of the [[Maloalmatinsky]] node, to the [[Titova]] pass (3630 m).

==Description==
If you walk along the plateau to the final moraine of the Tuyuksu glacier and climb a little along the serpentine, you can see the famous Tuyuksu Horseshoe - the four-thousandth peaks that form the horseshoe. Climate mountain average annual temperature -2.7 degrees, 237 days a year there is snow, precipitation falls 743 millimeters a year. Here, at an altitude of 3020 meters above sea level, the Malaya Almatinsk river is blocked by an anti-settlement dam - a metal mesh filled with stones 17.0 m high, 300 meters long and with a storage capacity of 0.23 million m3. Next to the dam is the hydrometeorological station Mynzh, which has been conducting its observations since 1936. From the dam, it is impossible to see the entire panorama of the circus of the Tuyuksu glacier, because it is closed by a high moraine shaft in the upper reaches of the tract. Only Ordzhonikidze and Tuyuksu peaks are visible. In the North direction from the mynzhilki tract, the rock Bastion of the Yoshkar-Ola peak is visible on the right in the ridge above the road. From the weather station on the trail you can climb to the popular Parking lot called \"Alpingrad\", located in the circus of the glacier M. Mametova at the foot of the peaks of Amangeldy and Pioner.
It offers a panorama of the Central part of the Tuyuksu glacier and the Kumbel spur in the West, where the tops of Lokomotiv, Kosmodemyanskaya, Molodezhnaya, and Titova are located. There are three passes in the Kumbel spur: Lokomotiv and Molodezhny, leading to The kumbelsu gorge, and Titova pass, leading to the Gorelnik gorge.
From the Alpingrad Parking lot, through the Pioner and Uchitel passes, you can get to the Bogdanovich glacier, which gives rise to the Sauruksai river, which flows into the Left Talgar river. [[Manshuk Mametova]] pass leads to The left Talgar gorge on the \"Sunny glade\".{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} From the Parking lot \"Alpingrad\" ascents are made to the peaks of Amangeldy, the pioneer-Teacher array, Panfilov Heroes, Manshuk Mametova, Antikainen. Then there is the well-known moraine lake No. 6.
The Mynzhylki mountain plateau is located at the source of the Little (Malaya) Almaatinka river, 28 kilometers South of [[Almaty]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The tract is surrounded by Tuyuksu glaciers. To get to mynzhilki, first you need to get to Medeo, then it is convenient to continue on the cable car to cimbulak, and then on foot-5.7&nbsp;km. the Road goes all the way to the plateau, the climb is not steep, starting from the \"Tuyuksu Gate\", it becomes harder to go — the height and slope increases. The weather, as elsewhere in the mountains, can change suddenly, especially outside the \"Gate\", where tourists are often met by a strong headwind. Above the beginning of the trail to \"Alpingrad\", between the right slope and the moraines of the Tuyuksu glacier, there are two more Parking lots - \"Tashkent\" and\"Black stone\". Parking \"Tashkent\" is a small enclosed grassy area, not blown by the winds. That's why it's warm in the Parking lot. The \"Black stone\" Parking lot is located above and is named after a characteristic large stone of dark color. From these sites, ascents are made to the tops of the Tuyuksu glacier circus, located in the Malo-Almaty spur, or category passes are passed in the Malo-Almaty spur, South of Mametova peak, leading to the Left Talgar gorge.

==Protection and visit==
The Ile-Alatau state national natural Park<ref>http://www.ile-alatau.kz</ref> Administration is responsible for the preservation and protection of the monument. It has a favorable acoustic environment (silence, melodic sounds in nature). Recommended visiting periods: may - October. The route is avalanche-prone, namely after snowfall and in the spring.

'''USS ''Goodrich'' (DD/DDR-831)''' was a {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer}} of the [[United States Navy]], named for Rear Admiral [[Caspar F. Goodrich]] (1847–1925), and his son, Lieutenant [[Caspar Goodrich]] (died 1907).

''Goodrich'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 25 February 1945 by the [[Bath Iron Works]] Co., [[Bath, Maine]]; sponsored by Mrs. Caspar F. Goodrich, widow of Admiral Goodrich and mother of Lt. Goodrich; and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 24 April 1945, Commander Dale R. Frakes in command.

==Service history==
After shakedown training in the [[Caribbean]], ''Goodrich'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 12 November 1945 to support the [[occupation of Japan]]. She patrolled between principal [[Japan]]ese ports until October 1946; then she based at [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]], [[China]], for patrol along the coast of [[Korea]]. The destroyer returned to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], on 21 December 1946 and departed on 7 January 1947 to base at [[Naval Station Newport|Newport, Rhode Island]], as a unit of the [[United States Atlantic Fleet]].

''Goodrich'' overhauled in the [[New York Naval Shipyard]], then served in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (2 February - 22 May 1948). This was her first of many annual tours with the \"steel gray stabilizers\" of the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]], of actively countering the repeated threats of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s to overrun the defenseless nations of the [[Balkans]] and the [[Middle East]].

''Goodrich'' was reclassified a [[radar picket]] destroyer, DDR-831, on 18 March 1949.

[[File:USS Goodrich (DD-831) underway in 1945.jpg|thumb|left|''Goodrich'' in 1945.]]

Her service included patrol along the [[Israel]]i-[[Egypt]]ian border of the [[Red Sea]] in February 1956 to help stem the [[Suez Crisis|Mid-East crisis]] that finally culminated in the nationalization of the [[Suez Canal]]. When fighting erupted, she sped back to the Mediterranean in November 1956 to protect Americans in that area and serve notice that the United States was determined to contain and terminate the conflict. The destroyer supported the landing of [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Marines at Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], on 14 July 1958, as the Navy again met and checked a [[Communist]] thrust against the Western democracies.

''Goodrich'' shifted her home port in June 1959 from Newport to [[Naval Station Mayport|Mayport, Florida]]. Thereafter her annual deployments to the Mediterranean included intensive training in all forms of naval welfare with [[NATO]] units and a constant readiness with the 6th Fleet to meet any threat to peace in the Mediterranean region. She interrupted her schedule in January 1960, entering the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] for an eight-month modernization overhaul (FRAM II) which included complete renovation and latest weapons and shipboard equipment. She was on [[Project Mercury]] recovery station on 12 February 1962 as Lieutenant Colonel [[John H. Glenn]], USMC, made his successful [[Friendship 7|orbital space flight]].

''Goodrich'' went on alert again with the 6th Fleet during 24 October to 20 November 1962 when the Navy responded to President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call for a [[Cuban missile crisis|quarantine of Cuba]] that choked off the flow of military supplies and enforced the American demands for the withdrawal of the Soviet missile experts and equipment. On 22 July 1966 the destroyer got underway from Mayport on her 13th 6th Fleet deployment. She cruised throughout the Mediterranean for five months, unobtrusively patrolling with the 6th Fleet and taking part in combined naval warfare exercises with units of the [[Turkish Navy|Turkish]], [[Hellenic Navy|Greek]], [[Royal Navy|British]], and [[Italian Navy|Italian Navies]]. She returned to Mayport on 20 December 1966 for upkeep and type training.

''Goodrich'' was reclassified DD-831 on 1 January 1969, and was decommissioned on 30 November 1969. Berthed at Orange, Texas, ''Goodrich'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 February 1974. She was sold on 12 September 1977, and broken up for scrap.

'''Barış Akarsu''' (June 29, 1979 – July 4, 2007) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[rock music]]ian and actor who rose to fame after winning the television series ''Akademi Türkiye'' (Academy Turkey) in July 2004. He released two studio albums in three years and was also acting in television series ''Yalancı Yarim'' (My Lying Lover) which aired on [[Star TV (Turkey)|Star TV]].

On 29 June 2007, he was seriously injured in a car accident on his way back from a charity concert for children. After spending five days in an intensive care unit, he died of complications from the accident on 4 July 2007, at the age of 28.

== Early life ==
Akarsu was born and raised in [[Bartın]], in northern [[Turkey]]. He was a huge fan of rock music, listening to music from [[Ruhi Su]], [[Cem Karaca]] and [[Barış Manço]] as well as Western acts like [[Led Zeppelin]] or [[U2]].

His friends and Akarsu gathered at the seaside of Amasra to chat and sing songs while playing guitar. There, Akarsu formed his early ties with singing and playing instruments. Music always played a crucial part in his life. His other big ambition was [[tae kwon do]], basketball and sailing (in high-school he was sailing professionally in Amasra Sailing Club).<ref>[http://www.haber7.com/haber.php?haber_id=253775 Haber7.com July 5, 2007]</ref>

== Musical career ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Baris Akarsu.jpg|thumb|right|Barış Akarsu in 2006]] -->
Before rising to fame with his musical and screen projects, Akarsu worked as an entertainer in beach resorts in [[Antalya]]. Later he moved to [[Karadeniz Ereğli]], where he started singing regularly at bars, the local television and radio shows before joining the TV show ''Academy Turkey''. Shortly after winning the show, he moved to [[Istanbul]] to pursue a career in music.

Barış Akarsu released his first album ''[[Islak Islak]]'', followed by his second ''[[Düşmeden Bulutlarda Koşmam Gerek]]'' released in August 2006. He appeared on music videos for his songs “Islak Islak”, “Kimdir O”, “Mavi” and “Amasra” from his first and “Vurdum En Dibe Kadar” and “Yaz Demedim” from his second album. He composed and wrote the lyrics for “Ben” and “Yeter Be” from his second album. At the time of his death, he was working on his unreleased third album.

== Acting career ==

Akarsu's first and only appearance as an actor is in the popular Turkish comedy series ''Yalancı Yarim''. In the show, Akarsu portrays a wealthy young man, Tarık Tekelioğlu, who goes to Italy for his education but rather becomes the most successful [[World Rally Championship|rally]] driver.

Also, Akarsu acted in F5 Malt Drink commercial in 2005.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070514200932/http://www.reklamlar.tv/rtv/sin/one/N/P_P/rv/BHDLZ F5 Malt Drink Commercial]</ref>
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Barsakarsu.jpg|thumb|right|Barış Akarsu|{{deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 11 September 2008}}]] -->

== Death ==
On June 29, 2007, Akarsu and two friends were on their way to a celebration party for his birthday in [[Bodrum]]. Their car collided with a truck at an intersection with no traffic lights. The driver of the car, Zeynep Koçak, and passenger Nalan Kahraman died on the day of the accident. Barış Akarsu was transported to a hospital with severe injuries. On July 4, 2007, Akarsu died due to complications arising from the accident.

The location of the accident is a crossroads at the end of a long and straight downhill grade. As a result of protests decrying the lack of traffic lights at that dangerous intersection, new lights have been installed. And also the intersection's name changed to \"Barış Intersection\" after his death. <ref>[http://www.cnnturk.com/TURKIYE/haber_detay.asp?PID=318&haberID=370164 CNN Turk July 1, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703173452/http://www.cnnturk.com/TURKIYE/haber_detay.asp?PID=318&haberID=370164 |date=July 3, 2007 }}</ref>

At the age of 15, as a preferential cadet in the team of {{lang|es|Puertos Las Palmas}} (being champion in Canary Islands and second in Spain), he had to choose between football and music.<ref name=\"VDC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vocesdecuenca.com/web/voces-de-cuenca/-/a-la-venta-las-entradas-para-el-concierto-de-danny-romero-en-casasimarro |title=A la venta las entradas para el concierto de Danny Romero en Casasimarro |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=4 August 2018 |website=vocesdecuenca.com |language=es |access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>

A year later, he created \"Agáchate\", which was an immediate hit and has generated more than 30 million views on YouTube, swept clubs and sale lists in [[South America]], reaching No. 1 in [[Venezuela]]. Since then he is one of the most-requested producers and DJs in Spain by artists, clubs and fans.<ref name=\"VDC\" />

== Life ==
Lucas enrolled to study, first [[Protestant Theology]] and then law at the [[University of Königsberg]] in 1816. In March 1818, he represented the Königsberger [[Landsmannschaft (Studentenverbindung)|Landsmannschaft]] ([[Burschenschaft|fraternity]]) on the ''Allgemeinen Deutschen Burschenschaft'' (ADB) in [[Jena]].<ref>Eduard Loch: ''Geschichte des Corps Masovia'', 1. Königsberg i. Pr. 1930</ref>  On behalf of [[Theodor von Schön]], Oberpräsident (Governor) of [[West Prussia]] he organised the libraries and archives of the monasteries, following the [[Dissolution (law)|dissolution]] of 1818–1835. In 1820 he began an academic career. In 1822 he became a teacher at the [[Altstadt Gymnasium]] in [[Königsberg]], in 1828 he served on Government School Board as an assistant to [[Gustav Friedrich Dinter]] and in 1832 became director of the newly reorganised [[Kneiphof Gymnasium]]. By 1835 he was an associate professor of German literature. Succeeding Reinhold Bernhard Jachmann, he served on the Provincial School Board for East Prussia in 1843, and in 1848 transferred to Posen Province.<ref>Robert Albinus: ''Königsberg Lexikon''. Würzburg 2002, {{ISBN|3-88189-441-1}}</ref>

==Influence ==
He is best known in the English literature the influence of his writing on [[legend]]s on [[Wagner]], in particular the role of ''Über den Krieg von Wartburg'' (1836) in inspiring the opera [[Tannhäuser (opera)|''Tannhäuser und der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg'']] (1845).{{sfn|Westernhagen|1981|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=QDQ7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA70 p.&nbsp;70]}} Through the work of Lucas, Wagner learned much about [[Mediaeval]] [[saga]], as he put it \"The German Middle Ages in a significant coloring I had not yet dreamed of\". Wagner also drew on Lucas for his ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', ''[[Parsifal]]'' and ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' operas.{{sfn|Kinderman|2013|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=IQBsjbvFgW4C&pg=PA54 pp.&nbsp;54–56]}}{{sfn|Borchmeyer|2003}}

In March 1818, he represented the Königsberger [[Landsmannschaft (Studentenverbindung)|Landsmannschaft]] ([[Burschenschaft|fraternity]]) on the ''Allgemeinen Deutschen Burschenschaft'' (ADB) in [[Jena]].<ref>Eduard Loch: ''Geschichte des Corps Masovia'', 1. Königsberg i. Pr. 1930</ref>  On behalf of [[Theodor von Schön]], Oberpräsident (Governor) of [[West Prussia]] he organised the libraries and archives of the monasteries, following the [[Dissolution (law)|dissolution]] of 1818–1835. In 1820 he began an academic career. In 1822 he became a teacher at the [[Altstadt Gymnasium]] in [[Königsberg]], in 1828 he served on Government School Board as an assistant to [[Gustav Friedrich Dinter]] and in 1832 became director of the newly reorganised [[Kneiphof Gymnasium]]. By 1835 he was an associate professor of German literature. Succeeding Reinhold Bernhard Jachmann, he served on the Provincial School Board for East Prussia in 1843, and in 1848 transferred to Posen Province.<ref>Robert Albinus: ''Königsberg Lexikon''. Würzburg 2002, {{ISBN|3-88189-441-1}}</ref>

==Influence ==
He is best known in the English literature the influence of his writing on [[legend]]s on [[Wagner]], in particular the role of ''Über den Krieg von Wartburg'' (1836) in inspiring the opera [[Tannhäuser (opera)|''Tannhäuser und der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg'']] (1845).{{sfn|Westernhagen|1981|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=QDQ7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA70 p.&nbsp;70]}} Through the work of Lucas, Wagner learned much about [[Mediaeval]] [[saga]], as he put it \"The German Middle Ages in a significant coloring I had not yet dreamed of\". Wagner also drew on Lucas for his ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', ''[[Parsifal]]'' and ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' operas.{{sfn|Kinderman|2013|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=IQBsjbvFgW4C&pg=PA54 pp.&nbsp;54–56]}}{{sfn|Borchmeyer|2003}}

'''Cory Procter''' (born October 18, 1982) is a former [[American football]] [[Guard (American football)|guard]] in the [[National Football League]] for the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Miami Dolphins]]. He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Montana]].

==Early years==
Procter attended [[Gig Harbor High School]] and was a [[Letterman (sports)|letterman]] in [[High school football|football]] and [[scholastic wrestling|wrestling]]. In football, he was twice named the team [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] and as a senior, he earned All-League offensive lineman, All-Area, All-State, and All-Northwest honors. In wrestling, he was twice named the team MVP.

He accepted a football scholarship to play for the [[University of Montana]], where he became a four-year starter with 42 consecutive starts (47 total). He started 5 games at [[right tackle]] as a freshman, because of injuries on the [[offensive line]] and contributed to the team winning the [[2001 NCAA Division I-AA football season|Division I-AA National Championship]]. As a sophomore, he was moved to [[Guard (American football)|left guard]]. As a junior and senior, he returned to play [[right tackle]].

== Function ==

Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.<ref name=\"entrez\" />

== Ligands ==
The OR1G1 receptor is associated with sensory sensations including \"waxy\", \"fatty\", and \"rose\",<ref name=\"pmid18603653\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanz G, Thomas-Danguin T, Hamdani EH, Le Poupon C, Briand L, Pernollet JC, Guichard E, Tromelin A | display-authors = 6 | title = Relationships between molecular structure and perceived odor quality of ligands for a human olfactory receptor | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 639–53 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18603653 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/bjn032 | doi-access = free }}</ref>, and also \"fruity\" and \"sweet\".<ref name=\"pmid24695519\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Audouze K, Tromelin A, Le Bon AM, Belloir C, Petersen RK, Kristiansen K, Brunak S, Taboureau O | display-authors = 6 | title = Identification of odorant-receptor interactions by global mapping of the human odorome | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = e93037 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24695519 | pmc = 3973694 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0093037 }}</ref>

Compared to other olfactory receptors such as [[OR52D1]], OR1G1 is broadly tuned to respond to odorants in different chemical classes, but it is sensitive to chain length, responding most strongly to chains of 9-10 carbons.<ref name=\"Sanz2005\">{{cite journal|authors=Guenhaël Sanz, Claire Schlegel, Jean-Claude Pernollet, Loïc Briand|title=Comparison of Odorant Specificity of Two Human Olfactory Receptors from Different Phylogenetic Classes and Evidence for Antagonism|journal=Chemical Senses|volume=30|issue=1|pages=69-80|date=January 2005|doi=10.1093/chemse/bji002|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Examples of agonists include:
* [[nonanal]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[1-nonanol]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[2-ethyl-1-hexanol]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[γ-decalactone]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[ethyl isobutyrate]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[1-octanol]]<ref name=\"pmid24695519\"/>
* [[celery ketone]]<ref name=\"pmid24695519\"/>
* [[citral]]<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/><ref name=\"pmid24695519\"/>
* [[isoamyl acetate]]<ref name=\"Matarazzo2005\">{{cite journal|authors=Valéry Matarazzo, Olivier Clot-Faybesse, Brice Marcet, Gaëlle Guiraudie-Capraz, Boriana Atanasova, Gérard Devauchelle, Martine Cerutti, Patrick Etiévant, Catherine Ronin|title=Functional Characterization of Two Human Olfactory Receptors Expressed in the Baculovirus Sf9 Insect Cell System|journal=Chemical Senses|volume=30|issue=3|pages=195–207|date=March 2005|doi=10.1093/chemse/bji015|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Example antagonists include:
* [[hexanal]]<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[1-hexanol]]<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[cyclohexanone]]<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>

The pattern of 6-carbon antagonists compared to ~9-carbon agonists is likely explained by OR1G1 having a deep pocket at its [[binding site]], such that the 6-carbon molecules block the opening, but do not reach the bottom of the deep pocket as required to activate the [[signal transduction]] chain.<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>

'''Olfactory receptor 1G1''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''OR1G1'' [[gene]].<ref name=\"pmid8004088\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ben-Arie N, Lancet D, Taylor C, Khen M, Walker N, Ledbetter DH, Carrozzo R, Patel K, Sheer D, Lehrach H | display-authors = 6 | title = Olfactory receptor gene cluster on human chromosome 17: possible duplication of an ancestral receptor repertoire | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–35 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8004088 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/hmg/3.2.229 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid9500546\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rouquier S, Taviaux S, Trask BJ, Brand-Arpon V, van den Engh G, Demaille J, Giorgi D | title = Distribution of olfactory receptor genes in the human genome | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 243–50 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9500546 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/ng0398-243 }}</ref><ref name=\"entrez\">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: OR1G1 olfactory receptor, family 1, subfamily G, member 1| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=8390| access-date = }}</ref>

== Function ==

Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.<ref name=\"entrez\" />

== Ligands ==
The OR1G1 receptor is associated with sensory sensations including \"waxy\", \"fatty\", and \"rose\",<ref name=\"pmid18603653\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanz G, Thomas-Danguin T, Hamdani EH, Le Poupon C, Briand L, Pernollet JC, Guichard E, Tromelin A | display-authors = 6 | title = Relationships between molecular structure and perceived odor quality of ligands for a human olfactory receptor | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 639–53 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18603653 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/bjn032 | doi-access = free }}</ref>, and also \"fruity\" and \"sweet\".<ref name=\"pmid24695519\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Audouze K, Tromelin A, Le Bon AM, Belloir C, Petersen RK, Kristiansen K, Brunak S, Taboureau O | display-authors = 6 | title = Identification of odorant-receptor interactions by global mapping of the human odorome | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = e93037 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24695519 | pmc = 3973694 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0093037 }}</ref>

Compared to other olfactory receptors such as [[OR52D1]], OR1G1 is broadly tuned to respond to odorants in different chemical classes, but it is sensitive to chain length, responding most strongly to chains of 9-10 carbons.<ref name=\"Sanz2005\">{{cite journal|authors=Guenhaël Sanz, Claire Schlegel, Jean-Claude Pernollet, Loïc Briand|title=Comparison of Odorant Specificity of Two Human Olfactory Receptors from Different Phylogenetic Classes and Evidence for Antagonism|journal=Chemical Senses|volume=30|issue=1|pages=69-80|date=January 2005|doi=10.1093/chemse/bji002|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Examples of agonists include:
* [[nonanal]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[1-nonanol]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[2-ethyl-1-hexanol]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[γ-decalactone]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[ethyl isobutyrate]] (strong)<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[1-octanol]]<ref name=\"pmid24695519\"/>
* [[celery ketone]]<ref name=\"pmid24695519\"/>
* [[citral]]<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/><ref name=\"pmid24695519\"/>
* [[isoamyl acetate]]<ref name=\"Matarazzo2005\">{{cite journal|authors=Valéry Matarazzo, Olivier Clot-Faybesse, Brice Marcet, Gaëlle Guiraudie-Capraz, Boriana Atanasova, Gérard Devauchelle, Martine Cerutti, Patrick Etiévant, Catherine Ronin|journal=Chemical Senses|volume=30|issue=3|pages=195–207|date=March 2005|doi=10.1093/chemse/bji015|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Example antagonists include:
* [[hexanal]]<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[1-hexanol]]<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>
* [[cyclohexanone]]<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>

The pattern of 6-carbon antagonists compared to ~9-carbon agonists is likely explained by OR1G1 having a deep pocket at its [[binding site]], such that the 6-carbon molecules block the opening, but do not reach the bottom of the deep pocket as required to activate the [[signal transduction]] chain.<ref name=\"Sanz2005\"/>

'''Artix Linux''', or '''Artix''' is a rolling-release distribution based on [[Arch Linux]] that uses [[OpenRC]], [[runit]] or [[s6 (software)|s6]] init instead of [[systemd]].

Artix Linux has its own package repositories but, as a [[Pacman (package manager)|pacman]]-based distribution, can use packages from Arch Linux repositories or any other derivative distribution, even packages explicitly depending on systemd. The [[Arch User Repository]] (AUR) can also be used.

Artix initially offered two installation environments, a base command-line ISO image and the graphical [[Calamares_(software)|Calamares installer]] based on [[LXQt]] desktop<ref>{{cite web |title=Early Artix Linux ISOs |url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/artix-linux/files/iso/ |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> with an [[I3 (window manager)|i3]] version following later<ref>{{cite web |title=Early Artix Linux ISOs / i3 |url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/artix-linux/files/iso/archived/i3/ |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>.

Additionally, two unofficial community editions featuring [[GTK]] and [[Qt (software)|Qt]] desktops and a larger software base are offered, aiming at too-busy-to-customise or less experienced users<ref>{{cite web |title=Artix Linux community ISOs |url=https://artixlinux.org/download.php#community |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>. All current installation media come in OpenRC, runit and s6 versions.

===Reception===
An early review published on [[DistroWatch]] on 27 November 2017 found a few bugs, but overall \"Artix is working with a good idea [...] It's minimal, it is rolling and it offers a little-used init system. All of these I think make the project worthwhile.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=First Artix Linux review at Distrowatch|url=https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20171127#artix |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> Distrowatch readers' reviews on Distrowatch are mostly very favourable, with an average rating of 8.4<ref>{{cite web |title=Reader supplied reviews for Artix Linux|url=https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=ratings&distro=artix |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>.

==History==

=== Early Years ===
Local residents started to raise funds for the hospital in 1921. '''Sarasota Hospital''' opened on November 2, 1925, with a capacity of 32-beds and usage of simple canvas tents.<ref name=\"SMH History\">{{cite web |url=https://www.smh.com/Home/About-Us/History |title=The History of Sarasota Memorial |website=Sarasota Memorial Health Care System |access-date=October 12, 2018}}</ref> In 1927, the facility was turned over to the city of Sarasota and was renamed '''Sarasota [[Municipality|Municipal]] Hospital'''. By the 1930s, the hospital had a capacity of 100 beds, an ambulance garage, nurse's home and a wing for patient overflow. The hospital continued to expand in the 1940s, with a surgical suite, kitchen and dining room and an air conditioned unit. The hospital was renamed in 1954 to its current name in honor of the veterans from [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Today, the facility has grown into the Sarasota Memorial Health Care System, a regional referral center with an 839-bed hospital and seven outpatient facilities, including a free-standing ER (its second Emergency Care Center), six urgent care centers, long- and short-term skilled nursing center, home health services, laboratory and imaging centers and specialty campuses stretching beyond the county lines.

'''''Mickey's Mellerdrammer''''' is a 1933  American animated [[Pre-Code]] [[short film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[United Artists]]. The title is a corruption of \"melodrama\", thought to harken back to the earliest [[minstrel shows]], as a film short based on [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' and stars [[Mickey Mouse]] and his friends who stage their own production of the novel.

The cartoon shows Mickey Mouse and some of the other characters dressed in [[blackface]] with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers made out of cotton; and his usual white gloves.

==Plot==

In ''Mickey's Mellerdrammer'', Mickey Mouse, [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Goofy]] (known then as [[Dippy Dawg]]) and others present their own low budget light-hearted rendition of the 19th century [[Tom Shows]] for a crowd in a barn converted into a theater for the occasion.

[[Horace Horsecollar]] plays the white slave owner [[Simon Legree]]. Minnie plays the young white girl, Eva. Mickey plays old [[Uncle Tom]] with cotton around his ears and chin, and the young slave girl Topsy. [[Clarabelle Cow]] plays the slave woman Eliza. [[Goofy]] plays the production stage hand.

The cartoon opens with Mickey and Clarabelle Cow in their dressing rooms applying [[blackface]] makeup for their roles (Mickey originally used a small dynamite to black up his face). The cartoon is much more focused on the Disney characters' efforts to put on the play, than an animated version of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]. The cartoon contains many images of Mickey and the other characters using makeshift props as sight gags.

The cartoon closes with the characters coming out for a bow, and Horace Horsecollar's character is pelted with rotten tomatoes. When Goofy shows his face from behind the stage, he is hit with a chocolate pie, leaving him in what appears to be [[blackface]], as Goofy laughs making the cartoon to end.

This short was released in Pathescope [[9.5 mm film|9.5mm]] print in the UK in 1954.

==Ethnic stereotyping==

Stereotyped characterizations of black people were then common. ''Mickey's Mellerdrammer'' was one of many films and cartoons of its era that referenced ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', and has been cited as 'particularly notable.'<ref>[https://archive.org/details/mightierthanswor0000reyn/page/243 <!-- quote=Mickey's Mellerdrammer. --> Reynolds, David S. ''Mightier than the Sword: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Battle for America'', 243. W. W. Norton & Company]</ref> [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], wondered how the cartoon evaded [[censorship]] of [[miscegenation]], given that Mickey and Minnie portray Tom and Eva, and are \"as they say, an item, and unmistakably so.\" (Additionally, Mickey is seen cross-dressing in the role of Topsy.)<ref>Reynolds, 244</ref>

In the beginning of this short, Clarabelle Cow appears in her dressing room applying lantern soot to her face and leaving an exaggerated area around her lips white. Mickey Mouse then takes a more \"comical\" approach to applying the makeup: He puts a firecracker in his mouth and lights it, which explodes, causing the ashes to paint his face black while leaving a large area around his lips white.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw06K0dG1Zw|title=Mickey Mouse - Mickey's Mellerdrammer - 1933|first=|last=VolterraChannel|date=August 17, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Mickey's bushy side whiskers and white gloves are also a representation of the use of blackface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/11266/Mickey-Mouse-s-trademark-white-gloves-have-racist-origins |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214195437/http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/11266/Mickey-Mouse-s-trademark-white-gloves-have-racist-origins |archivedate=December 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}{{better source|date=July 2016}}</ref>

'''Kevin Caron''' (born February 2, 1960, [[Stratford, Connecticut]]) is a [[Sculpture|sculptor]] from [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. He has created more than 50 private and public commissioned works which are on display across the United States. Among his works are pieces on public display in [[Tucson, Arizona]], [[Temple, Texas]], [[Avondale, Arizona]], [[Chandler, Arizona]], [[Surprise, Arizona]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. He was chosen as Visual Artist of the Year in the 2018 Phoenix Mayor's Arts Awards<ref>https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/see-who-won-the-2018-phoenix-mayors-arts-awards-10925311</ref>, and his [[public art]] sculpture ''Hands On'' won 17th Annual Best of the West Arts & Culture Award for 2009.<ref>[http://www.artprize.org/kevin-caron Artprize]</ref> He works primarily in fabricated steel.

Caron is also a pioneer in using 3D printing to create large scale 3D printed sculpture,<ref>http://dougbardwell.com/db/2015/03/26/3d-printing-part-two/</ref> using an 8-foot-tall Cerberus 3D Gigante 3D printer that he had built for him. His largest 3D-printed sculpture to date is a 5-1/2-foot tall sculpture, ''Epic Swoon,'' commissioned by PricewaterhouseCoopers in Columbus, Ohio.

== Life and career ==
Caron was born on February 2, 1960. He moved to Arizona with his family in 1973. He served six years in the [[United States Navy]], where he worked in machine shops, and aircraft maintenance yards. He was stationed in various ports of call including [[Diego Garcia]], and [[Misawa, Aomori|Misawa, Japan]]. He was honorably discharged in 1983.

He managed a car repair shop, and in between jobs, built his own vehicle. His career as a sculptor was inspired by his work on a privacy screen. When he had completed the screen, he visualized a fountain made from the same material. Caron became a full-time artist in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kevincaron.com/page_images/kevincaron-biography-current.pdf |title=Biography, Kevin Caron |access-date=2013-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805232059/http://www.kevincaron.com/page_images/kevincaron-biography-current.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

He lists M.C. Escher and Antoine Pevsner among his design inspirations.<ref>http://www.westermans.com/blog/awesome-artists-kevin-caron-shares-his-story/</ref>

In 2014, he began working with 3D printing and now creates sculptures as tall as 5-1/2 feet using his 8-foot-tall Cerberus 3D Gigante printer.

'''HMS ''G7''''' was a [[British G-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during World War I.

==Description==
The G-class submarines were designed by the [[Admiralty]] in response to a rumour that the Germans were building [[double hull|double-hulled]] submarines for overseas duties. The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>

The boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>

==Career==
Like the rest of her class, ''G7''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]]. On 15 April 1917, ''G7'' was patrolling between [[Lerwick]] and [[Bergen]] when she sighted the German submarine {{ship|SM|U-30|Germany|2}}. ''G7'' fired a torpedo at ''U-30'' and after an exchange of gunfire the German submarine dived away. Although ''U-30'' escaped unscathed, ''G7'' had interrupted ''U30''{{'}}s attempts to sink two Norwegian merchant ships. One, {{Ship|SS|Svanfos|1905|2}}, which still had a boarding party from ''U-30'' aboard, returned to Bergen under her own steam, while the second, the ''Borgila'', had been abandoned by her crew. ''G7'' put a salvage party aboard ''Borgila'' until the Norwegian destroyer {{Ship|HNoMS|Draug|1908|2}} arrived to take over.<ref>''Monograph No. 34'', &nbsp;p. 460.</ref>

In October 1918 ''G7'' was on patrol in the North Sea. Communications were lost on 23 October and she was declared lost on 1 November.

One, {{Ship|SS|Svanfos|1905|2}}, which still had a boarding party from ''U-30'' aboard, returned to Bergen under her own steam, while the second, the ''Borgila'', had been abandoned by her crew. ''G7'' put a salvage party aboard ''Borgila'' until the Norwegian destroyer {{Ship|HNoMS|Draug|1908|2}} arrived to take over.<ref>''Monograph No. 34'', &nbsp;p. 460.</ref>

In October 1918 ''G7'' was on patrol in the North Sea. Communications were lost on 23 October and she was declared lost on 1 November.

'''Lower Juba''' ({{lang-so|Jubbada Hoose}}, {{lang-ar|جوبا السفلى}}, {{lang-it|Basso Giuba}}) is an administrative region (''[[Administrative divisions of Somalia|gobol]]'') in southern [[Somalia]].<ref name=\"Cwfsom\">{{cite web|title=Somalia|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html|accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> With its capital at [[Kismayo]], it lies in the [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous]] [[Jubaland]] region. It has green forests and wild life animals such as lions, giraffes, hippos, crocodiles, and hyenas.

Lower Juba is bordered by [[Kenya]], the Somali regions of [[Gedo]], [[Middle Juba]] (Jubbada Dhexe), and the [[Somali Sea]]. The province is named after the [[Jubba River]] that passes through it and empties into the [[Somali Sea]] at [[Goobweyn]]. The [[Lag Badana National Park]] is situated in Lower Juba.

==History==
However, in the latter half of the 20th century,  A very few Darod families started to settle in Kismayo city. By the turn of the 20th century, as a guest, they had established a small business centres. In the beginning of the Somali civil wars, Kismaio known as Waamo faced a massive destruction among the faction leaders mainly between Hawiye and Darod each claiming the ownership of the Lower & Middle Juba regions. But on the other side, the city subsequently evolved economically into a major hub of the livestock trade.<ref name=\"Cassanelli\">Lee V.

Moreover, to be honest with the Wikipedia, the profile of those regions was presented with false information background. We will provide the facts and figures from the books of I M Lewis on the Somali territory and Prof Ahmed Ismail Samatar.   

Between 1974 and 1975, a major drought referred to as the ''Abaartii Dabadheer'' (\"The Lingering Drought\") occurred in the northern regions of Somalia. The [[Soviet Union]], which at the time maintained strategic relations with the [[Siad Barre]] government, airlifted some 90,000 people from the devastated regions of [[Hobyo]] and [[Caynaba]]. New small settlements referred to as ''Danwadaagaha'' (\"Collective Settlements\") were then created in Jubbada Hoose (Lower Jubba) and [[Jubbada Dhexe]] (Middle Jubba) regions. The transplanted families were also introduced to farming and fishing techniques, a change from their traditional pastoralist lifestyle of livestock herding.

==Districts==

→‎External links:add authority control,safe,Ser Amantio di Nicolao,"[[Gilles Deleuze]], a French philosopher, and [[Félix Guattari]], a French psychoanalyst and political activist, wrote a number of works together (besides both having distinguished independent careers).

Their conjoint works were ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', ''Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature,'' and ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]''

==''Capitalism and Schizophrenia''==

A two volume work, consisting of ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'' was an influential success; and, with its critique of psychoanalytic conformity,<ref>[[Elisabeth Roudinesco]], ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 385 and 414</ref> marked a significant step in the evolution of [[post-structuralism]].<ref>J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 236-8</ref> Its emphasis on the nomadic nature of knowledge and identity, as seen for example in the authors' stress on the continuities between the human and the animal,<ref>Bruce Boehrer, ''Shakespeare among the Animals'' (2002) p. 36 and p. 186</ref><ref>{{Citation | title= Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human | year=2015 | url= https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.</ref> also places it among the formative texts of [[postmodernism]]. Stark and Laurie argue that ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' also \"responded to the failures of Marxist revolutionary movements to purge themselves of the vices they were
seeking to overthrow, including prejudice, dogmatism, nationalism and hierarchies of power\".<ref>Laurie, Timothy and Stark, Hannah. 2012. \"Reconsidering kinship: beyond the nuclear family with Deleuze and Guattari\". Cultural Studies Review, vol. 18 no. 1, 20. URL: http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/csrj/article/view/1612</ref>

[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] in his preface to the first volume called it \"a book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in quite a long time\".<ref>Quoted in G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 163</ref> [[Fredric Jameson]] praised it for re-introducing the flux of history into the static world of [[structuralism]].<ref>M. Hardt/K.Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 179-80</ref>

The book's celebration of the [[pre-oedipal]] has also been seen as sketching a strategy for survival under the capitalism of [[late modernity]].<ref>Childers, p. 214 and p. 269</ref>

==Kafka==

Unhappy with the treatment of [[Franz Kafka]]’s work by scholars, Deleuze and Guattari wrote ''Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature'' in order to attack previous analyses of Kafka which they saw as limiting him either \"by oedipalizing and relating him to mother-father narratives—or by trying to limit him to theological-metaphysical speculation to the detriment of all the political, ethical, and ideological dimensions that run through his work\".<ref>Bensmaia, Reda. \"Foreword: The Kafka Effect.\" Foreword. Kafka: Towards a Minor Literature. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota, 1975. Print.</ref>

Published in 1975, their book sought to enter Kafka’s works through deliberately imprecise analytical modes such as flow and intensity,<ref>Childers, p. 268</ref> without the unnecessary burden of the type of analysis that relates works to past or existing categories of genre, type, mode, or style. The latter sort of analysis is related to what Deleuze and Guattari would call the \"Major\" or dominant literature, out of which they see Kafka emerging as a voice of a marginalized, minority people re-appropriating the major language for his own purposes, and stressing collective forces over the individual \"literary master\".<ref>A. Parr, ''The Deleuze Dictionary'' (2005) p. 136</ref>

==Other works==

Deleuze and Guattari also wrote ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]'' together, in which, drawing from [[David Hume]], they construct a view of philosophy as both based on experience and a quasi-[[virtual world]].<ref>E. Alliez, ''Signature of the World'' (2004) p. 88</ref>

==Personal/political==

Guattari has described how his collaboration with Deleuze arose out of the aftermath of the [[May 1968 events in France]], as well as the additional energy generated in his writings by the collaboration.<ref>F. Guattari, ''Chaosophy'' (1995) p. 27-31</ref>

==Criticisms==

In addition to criticisms of contemporary misapplications of Deleuze and Guattari's ideas,<ref>Lambert, Gregg. 2006. Who's Afraid of Deleuze and Guattari? London: Continuum.</ref> philosophical critiques have been made of Deleuze and Guattari's anti-Hegelianism<ref>Malabou, Catherine. 1996. \"Who’s Afraid of Hegelian Wolves?\" In Deleuze: A Critical Reader, edited by Paul Patton, 114-138. Oxford: Blackwell.</ref> and their \"fraternal\" imaginaries.<ref>Jardine, Alice. 1985. Gynesis: Configurations of Woman and Modernity. Ithaca: Cornell University Press.</ref> Commenting on the relationship between [[anthropology]] and politics in [[Anti-Oedipus]], Timothy Laurie also notes that \"Deleuze and Guattari fall back on a methodological dogma that aligns femininity with reproduction and masculinity with politics and/or the primordial ‘male bond.’\"<ref>{{Citation | title= Epistemology as Politics and the Double-Bind of Border Thinking: Lévi-Strauss, Deleuze and Guattari, Mignolo | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Portal: Journal of Multidisciplinary International Studies | volume= 9 | issue= 2 | pages= 1–20 | year= 2012 | url= https://www.academia.edu/2137504}}</ref>

The latter sort of analysis is related to what Deleuze and Guattari would call the \"Major\" or dominant literature, out of which they see Kafka emerging as a voice of a marginalized, minority people re-appropriating the major language for his own purposes, and stressing collective forces over the individual \"literary master\".<ref>A. Parr, ''The Deleuze Dictionary'' (2005) p. 136</ref>

==Other works==

Deleuze and Guattari also wrote ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]'' together, in which, drawing from [[David Hume]], they construct a view of philosophy as both based on experience and a quasi-[[virtual world]].<ref>E. Alliez, ''Signature of the World'' (2004) p. 88</ref>

==Personal/political==

Guattari has described how his collaboration with Deleuze arose out of the aftermath of the [[May 1968 events in France]], as well as the additional energy generated in his writings by the collaboration.<ref>F. Guattari, ''Chaosophy'' (1995) p. 27-31</ref>

==Criticisms==

In addition to criticisms of contemporary misapplications of Deleuze and Guattari's ideas,<ref>Lambert, Gregg. 2006. Who's Afraid of Deleuze and Guattari? London: Continuum.</ref> philosophical critiques have been made of Deleuze and Guattari's anti-Hegelianism<ref>Malabou, Catherine. 1996. \"Who’s Afraid of Hegelian Wolves?\" In Deleuze: A Critical Reader, edited by Paul Patton, 114-138. Oxford: Blackwell.</ref> and their \"fraternal\" imaginaries.<ref>Jardine, Alice. 1985. Gynesis: Configurations of Woman and Modernity. Ithaca: Cornell University Press.</ref> Commenting on the relationship between [[anthropology]] and politics in [[Anti-Oedipus]], Timothy Laurie also notes that \"Deleuze and Guattari fall back on a methodological dogma that aligns femininity with reproduction and masculinity with politics and/or the primordial ‘male bond.’\"<ref>{{Citation | title= Epistemology as Politics and the Double-Bind of Border Thinking: Lévi-Strauss, Deleuze and Guattari, Mignolo | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Portal: Journal of Multidisciplinary International Studies | volume= 9 | issue= 2 | pages= 1–20 | year= 2012 | url= https://www.academia.edu/2137504}}</ref>
