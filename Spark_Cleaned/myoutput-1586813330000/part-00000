It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album, ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'' (1994). Originally written about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean, the song's title is an [[wikt:onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic phrase]] suggesting the palpitating heartbeat of a person [[lovestruck]] by the object of their affection. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was written by Selena and her backup vocalist and dancer [[Pete Astudillo]].\n\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" is a [[Mexican cumbia]] pop song with ''[[rock en espa\u00f1ol]]'' and [[reggae]] influences. It received widespread acclaim for its musically diverse sounds, and the effects it had on listeners. The single peaked at number one on the United States [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart and remained there for four consecutive weeks, the singer's second consecutive number one single. Selena began dominating the Latin music charts, and \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" contributed to her commercial success. It is believed by musicologist [[Ilan Stavans]] to have marked the beginning of the dominance of [[Latin pop]], and was a bridge to the Tejano market. The song is considered to be one of the best [[List of songs recorded by Selena|compositions recorded by Selena]], one of her most popular recordings, and has been cited as one of her [[signature song]]s. Her [[Astrodome]] concert performance of the song has been called one of the highlights of her musical career. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was ranked at number 54 on the list of the Best Texas Songs of All-time, and given honorable mention as one of the top ten best Tejano recordings of all-time.\n\nAfter the [[Murder of Selena|shooting death of Selena]] in 1995, the song's title became a popular verb to describe a fan's admiration for the singer. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" won the [[Tejano Music Awards|Tejano Music Award]] for Song of the Year, while [[Broadcast Music Inc.]] recognized it as the most played Latin song of 1996. Since ''Billboard'' began monitoring [[music download]]s in 2010, \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" has remained on the [[Billboard charts#Latin|Regional Mexican Digital Songs]] chart for 280 non-consecutive weeks, second to the number of consecutive weeks for her 1992 single \"[[Como la Flor]]\". Many musicians have since recorded the song or performed it as a tribute to the singer including: [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n]], [[Kat Von D]], and [[Jennifer Pe\u00f1a]].\n\n== Background and writing ==\n[[File:Crybaby.jpg|thumb|The crybaby (pictured) [[riff]] that Selena's husband [[Chris P\u00e9rez]] performed, became the musical foundation of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\".]]\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" originated at her band's rehearsals starting off as an improvised song with few if any lyrics.{{sfn|Arrar\u00e1s|1997|p=66}} According to Selena's brother, and principal music producer [[A.B.

It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album, ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'' (1994). Originally written about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean, the song's title is an [[wikt:onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic phrase]] suggesting the palpitating heartbeat of a person [[lovestruck]] by the object of their affection. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was written by Selena and her backup vocalist and dancer [[Pete Astudillo]].\n\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" is a [[Mexican cumbia]] pop song with ''[[rock en espa\u00f1ol]]'' and [[reggae]] influences. It received widespread acclaim for its musically diverse sounds, and the effects it had on listeners. The single peaked at number one on the United States [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart and remained there for four consecutive weeks, the singer's second consecutive number one single. Selena began dominating the Latin music charts, and \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" contributed to her commercial success. It is believed by musicologist [[Ilan Stavans]] to have marked the beginning of the dominance of [[Latin pop]], and was a bridge to the Tejano market. The song is considered to be one of the best [[List of songs recorded by Selena|compositions recorded by Selena]], one of her most popular recordings, and has been cited as one of her [[signature song]]s. Her [[Astrodome]] concert performance of the song has been called one of the highlights of her musical career. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was ranked at number 54 on the list of the Best Texas Songs of All-time, and given honorable mention as one of the top ten best Tejano recordings of all-time.\n\nAfter the [[Murder of Selena|shooting death of Selena]] in 1995, the song's title became a popular verb to describe a fan's admiration for the singer. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" won the [[Tejano Music Awards|Tejano Music Award]] for Song of the Year, while [[Broadcast Music Inc.]] recognized it as the most played Latin song of 1996. Since ''Billboard'' began monitoring [[music download]]s in 2010, \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" has remained on the [[Billboard charts#Latin|Regional Mexican Digital Songs]] chart for 280 non-consecutive weeks, second to the number of consecutive weeks for her 1992 single \"[[Como la Flor]]\". Many musicians have since recorded the song or performed it as a tribute to the singer including: [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n]], [[Kat Von D]], and [[Jennifer Pe\u00f1a]].\n\n== Background and writing ==\n[[File:Crybaby.jpg|thumb|The crybaby (pictured) [[riff]] that Selena's husband [[Chris P\u00e9rez]] performed, became the musical foundation of \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\".]]\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" originated at her band's rehearsals starting off as an improvised song with few if any lyrics.{{sfn|Arrar\u00e1s|1997|p=66}} According to Selena's brother, and principal music producer [[A.B.

Selena notices the man looking at her, then she looks away smiling. Meanwhile, she begins to sing the song \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\".

A street-seller approaches the man to sell roses, and is successful, as he asks for one. The man then gives the roses to Selena and asks her (by gesturing with a nod of his head) to follow him.

to Tejano music were \"significant\", because she adapted a new style of Tejano cumbia (or Mexican cumbia) with \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\".{{sfn|Stavans|2014|p=725}} The song was recognized by Lori Beth
