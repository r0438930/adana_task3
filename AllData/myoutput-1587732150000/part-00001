KXXO now [[KAKC]] and [[KMOD-FM]] in Tulsa were acquired under the name \"San Antonio Broadcasting\" (same as KEEZ).

By 1995, Clear Channel owned 43 radio stations and 16 television stations. When the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] became law, the act deregulated media ownership, allowing a company to own more stations than previously allowed. Clear Channel went on a subsequent buying spree, purchasing more than 70 other media companies and individual stations.\n\nIn a few cases, following purchase of a competitor, Clear Channel was forced to [[Divestment|divest]] some of its stations, as it was above the legal thresholds in some cities.

square.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Billboards at [[Dundas Square]] in Toronto, owned by Clear Channel.]]\n[[Clear Channel Outdoor]] (CCO) is an advertising company that was previously owned by iHeartMedia. Under the Clear Channel umbrella, Clear Channel Outdoor was built from the acquisition of [[Eller Media]], Universal Outdoor, and More Group Plc, giving iHeartMedia outdoor advertising space in 25 countries, while CCO also has a stake in Jolly Pubblicita S.p.A. of Italy. Other units of CCO include:\n* BBH Exhibits\n* Yellow Checker Star Cab Displays\n* Dauphin OTA (created by [[Jacques Dauphin]])\n* [[Donrey Media]], Ackerley Media\n* Companies in [[Chile]], [[Poland]], and [[Switzerland]]\n* [[APN News & Media]] in Australia (49% stake, including [[Adshel]])\n\nIn the United States, CCO operates over 1,100 [[digital billboard]]s in 27 markets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://company.clearchanneloutdoor.com/investor-relations/ |title=Investor Relations for Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCOH) |publisher=Company.clearchanneloutdoor.com |date= |access-date=2018-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233524/http://company.clearchanneloutdoor.com/investor-relations/ |archive-date=January 5, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Taxi Tops was sold to [[VeriFone]] in January 2010.  \n\nIn May 2019, it was spun out from iHeartMedia as part of its exit from bankruptcy.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Television===\nThe first television station iHeartMedia purchased as Clear Channel was [[WPMI-TV|WPMI]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]] in 1988. It owned more than 40 additional stations, a few of which are independent (non-network affiliates). In 2007, the company entered into an agreement to sell all its television stations to [[Providence Equity Partners]] for $1.2 billion,<ref name=\"Clear-Channel-Communications-Apr-2007-8-K\" /> a deal that eventually closed in March 2008.<ref name=\"Clear-Channel-Communications-Mar-2008-8-K\" /> All former Clear Channel television stations were owned by [[Newport Television]], while the other six were flipped to other buyers by Newport. In 2012 to mid-2013, Newport sold off all of its holdings to several other television groups, including [[News-Press & Gazette Company]], [[Cox Media Group]], [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting]] and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]].\n\n===Music charts===\niHeartMedia owns [[Mediabase]], which provide music charts based on songs and tracks receiving the most spins played on radio stations in the United States and Canada. A majority of stations that report to Mediabase are iHeartMedia outlets but other companies also report to the Mediabase charts. In addition, countdown shows produced by Premiere will utilize Mediabase charts for the basis of their programs.\n\n===News and information===\n* 24/7 News Source\n* Operates iHeartRadio News Network and local news networks in [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], [[Virginia]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Alabama]], [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]].\n* [[Premiere Radio Networks]]\n* Acquired and later sold the [[Agri Broadcast Network]] (ABN), a farm programming provider in Ohio.\n* Publishes ''Inside Radio'' magazine\n* Total Traffic reports: on-road and traffic conditions across the United States, and in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]].

In addition, iHeartMedia syndicates a number of its homegrown talk and music shows without the aid of Premiere. While Premiere actively sells its shows to stations, the non-Premiere syndicated shows are often used as a cost-cutting measure and do not have a large sales staff. Those shows also do not carry network-wide advertising (unless distributed by a third party), and allow the affiliates to keep all local spots, which increases their appeal. These networks carry many program hosts of various political ideologies and distribute a variety of programs to both iHeartMedia-owned and non-iHeartMedia-owned stations.\n\nIn addition to its own syndication network, iHeartMedia offers studio space and other services to the [[WestStar TalkRadio Network]], which is based at iHeartMedia's studios in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. As a result, many WestStar programs are heard on iHeartMedia stations.\n\nNot all programming heard on iHeartMedia's radio stations are produced in house; however, most of iHeartMedia's stations share many similarities to each other in branding and programming.\n\n===Format Lab and HD2 Formats===\n{{Main|iHeartRadio}}\nThe '''Format Lab''' was a radio programming think tank conceived, built and managed by Michael Albl for Clear Channel (now known as iHeartMedia) that produced 84 formats for use on AM/FM/HD/XM/Stream/Mobile. The formats ranged from mainstream formats, music genre niches, lifestyles to the highly experimental. These formats were heard on most of Clear Channel's [[HD Radio]] subchannels, on SiriusXM, Sprint MSpot and used as the original music streaming service for Clear Channel Online Music and Radio (CCOMR). In 2009, the Format Lab split into two programming services (1) Terrestrial Radio known as Premium Choice and (2) iHeartRadio online streaming.\n\n===iHeartRadio===\n{{Main|iHeartRadio}}\n'''iHeartRadio''' is a free broadcast, podcast and [[streaming radio]] [[Computing platform|platform]]. It is also the national umbrella brand for iHeartMedia's radio network aggregating its over 850 local iHeartMedia radio stations across the United States, as well as hundreds of other stations from various other media.\n\n===Alternative stations===\niHeartMedia Alternative Stations usually are branded as \"Radio\" (such as [[WRFF|Radio 104.5]] in Philadelphia or [[WRDA (FM)|Radio 105.7]]/[[WRDG|96.7]] in Atlanta), or \"ALT\" ([[KYSR|Alt 98.7]] in Los Angeles, and [[KLLT (FM)|Alt 104.9]] in St. Louis). Others include: The Edge, The Buzz, The Project, Star, or X. Their flagship Premium Choice Alternative Station is The Alternative Project broadcasting on WAXQ-FM 104.3 HD-2 in New York City. ''The Woody Show'', which originates from KYSR, serves as the anchor morning show for the iHeartMedia Alternative outlets.\n\n===Urban, urban AC and rhythmic stations===\nStations that carry programming catering to black Americans are a big part of many iHeartMedia clusters, particularly Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit. In many clusters iHeartMedia has two or more such stations. About half the Urban stations focus on Rap and Hip Hop along with younger [[rhythm and blues]] sounds. The other half blend some younger rhythm and blues along with some Soul from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s along with some current product. Some of the Hip Hop-based Urban stations report as Rhythmic Top 40 stations rather than Urban stations because these stations also have some appeal to white and Hispanic listeners. In a cluster with multiple urban stations owned by iHeartMedia, one is focused on Rap while the other is focused on Soul. Examples include Philadelphia, with [[WUSL]]'s focus on hip hop while [[WDAS-FM]] focuses on Soul (in addition, the company also owns a rhythmic AC station in that area, which is [[WISX]] 106.1), and Chicago, where [[WGCI-FM]] focuses on rap while [[WVAZ]] is focused on Soul. iHeartMedia urban and urban AC stations are branded as \"Real\" ([[KRRL]] Los Angeles), \"Beat\" ([[KQBT]]/Houston, [[WBTP]] [[Tampa]]) or \"Power\" ([[WWPR-FM|WWPR]] New York City, [[WUSL]] [[Philadelphia]] and [[WHEN (AM)|WHEN]] [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]). In San Francisco, iHeartMedia owned more urban-related stations such as Rhythmic Top 40 KYLD, [[urban oldies]] [[KISQ]], and [[urban contemporary]] [[KMEL]] in that area (KYLD shifted to Top 40/CHR in 2015, KISQ flipped to AC in 2016), and the same happened in [[Detroit]], where the company also owns [[urban AC]] [[WMXD]], [[urban contemporary]] [[WJLB]] and former [[rhythmic AC]] WDTW-FM (now [[WLLZ (FM)|WLLZ]]). iHeart also have Urban outlets with heritage and familiarity based on the markets they serve, like [[WHRK]] and [[WDIA]] in Memphis, and [[WKKV]] in Milwaukee.\n\nAnother growing format, Classic Hip-Hop/Throwback/Old School (consisting of R&B/Hip-Hop, Rap, and Rhythmic songs from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), can be heard full-time on iHeartRadio, as well as [[KATZ-FM]]/St. Louis and [[K256AS|KUBT-HD2 & its translator]] in Honolulu. Previously, this format was originated as Rhythmic Oldies, which was launched at KCMG/Los Angeles and later spread to more markets before the former Clear Channel flipped several stations out of the format by the mid-2000s.\n\nFor the Rhythmic Top 40 format, similar brandings include \"The Beat\" ([[KUBT]]/Honolulu and [[WBTT]]/Ft. Myers), [[KPRR|Power 102]]/El Paso, [[KKMY|104.5 Kiss FM]]/[[Beaumont, Texas]], \"Jam'n\" ([[KXJM]]/Portland Oregon, [[KSSX]]/San Diego, and [[WJMN-FM]]/Boston; a similar \"Jammin'\" is used at [[WSTV (FM)|WSTV]]/Roanoke & [[WJJX]]/Lynchburg). A \"B\" has been used at [[KBOS-FM|B95]]/Fresno since the 1980s. Others Rhythmics, such as [[KUBE (FM)|KUBE]]/Seattle, [[KDON-FM]]/Salinas-Monterey and [[KGGI]]/Riverside-San Bernardino, simply use the call letters and/or frequency. Most of these stations target a multicultural audience and play Rhythmic Pop, R&B/Hip-Hop, and Dance tracks.\n\nFor rhythmic AC stations, they used to have the \"Party\" branding (particularly during the time when most used ''[[Wake Up with Whoopi]]'' as their morning show), but the two \"Party\" stations in [[Denver]] ([[KPTT]]) and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] ([[KYMT]], the former KPLV) have since exited the [[rhythmic AC]] format. KPTT and KPLV moved to top 40, but continue to use the \"Party\" branding (KPLV is currently Variety Hits). All iHeartMedia rhythmic AC stations are now differently branded per station, although one of the outlets, [[WMOV-FM]]/Norfolk, uses the \"[[Movin' (brand)|Movin']]\" moniker which is trademarked under another company (that station has since shifted to Rhythmic Top 40). ''The Breakfast Club Morning Show'' out of [[WWPR-FM]] in New York and \"Big Boy's Neighborhood\" out of KRRL in Los Angeles are iHeartMedia's syndicated urban morning shows.\n\n===Smooth jazz===\nAs noted earlier, iHeartMedia has the Smooth Jazz Network (aka Your Smooth Jazz), which is programmed by Broadcast Architecture. Unless otherwise noted, all Smooth Jazz Network stations will carry the following schedule: [[Kenny G]] and Sandy Kovach in morning drive time, Miranda Wilson in midday, Allen Kepler in afternoon drive time, and Maria Lopez in evenings, with no disc jockeys overnight. Weekend programming consists of the Smooth Jazz Top 20 with Allen Kepler, as well as the [[Dave Koz]] Radio Show.\n\n===Dance and EDM===\nAlthough they have no full-powered stations programming a Dance or EDM (Electronic Dance Music) format, iHeartMedia has FM translators and HD2 platforms broadcasting the EDM-intensive [[Evolution (HD radio)|Evolution]] platform, while the LGBT community is served by the more broader-based [[Pride Radio (HD)|Pride Radio]]. However, iHeartMedia's Top 40/CHR and Rhythmic Top 40 outlets incorporate a majority of Dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows. A weekly countdown program, ''America\u2019s Dance 30'', airs on selected iHeart Top 40 and Rhythmic stations.\n\n===News talk stations===\nNews talk stations owned by iHeartMedia usually have a standard slate of hosts. The morning show is usually local, with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts. Programs that appear on many iHeartMedia talk stations include the ''[[Glenn Beck Program]]'' (Beck having gotten his talk show start at iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) owned [[WFLA (AM)|WFLA-AM]] in Tampa), ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', ''[[The Sean Hannity Show]]'', ''[[America Now with Andy Dean|America Now with Meghan McCain]]'' and ''[[Coast to Coast AM]] with George Noory'', all of which are affiliated with [[Premiere Radio Networks]] in some fashion. ''The [[Mark Levin]] Show'' and ''[[The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show]]'' are non-Premiere shows who air on many (if not most) iHeartMedia stations, as did ''[[The Savage Nation]]'' prior to its ending in September 2012. Limbaugh is almost universally carried on iHeartMedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station, including recently New York City: [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] was acquired in 2013 by Clear Channel and began carrying Limbaugh's program in 2014 following a long relationship with now-[[Cumulus Media]]-owned [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]. In markets where iHeartMedia-owned news talk stations have not been profitable (such as [[WXKS (AM)|Boston]] and [[WGST|Atlanta]]), iHeartMedia has chosen to sell shows such as Limbaugh and ''Coast to Coast AM'' to their rivals and change the stations to other formats.\n\nWhile most of iHeartMedia's news/talk stations carry some combination of Beck, Limbaugh, Hannity and Noory (of ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''), this is not always the case. Many stations (particularly in the larger markets) like [[KFI]], [[KFYI]], [[KOA (AM)|KOA]], [[WZZR]] and [[WLW]] broadcast a lineup with significant local programming.\n\niHeartMedia does not operate any [[all-news radio]] stations. For a brief time in the late 2000s, [[KFXR (AM)|KFXR]] in Dallas ran a direct feed of [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]] under the on-air name ''CNN 1190'', but KFXR dropped that format in 2009. Almost all of iHeartMedia's primary talk stations are affiliated with [[Fox News Radio]] for national news, part of a multi-year deal between iHeartMedia and Fox. However, since 2012 iHeartMedia has provided an all-news feed called 24/7 News. This radio network is exclusive to iHeartRadio. Since 2016, 24/7 News partners with [[NBC News]] to launch the [[NBC News Radio]].\n\n[[Liberal talk radio]] is heard on a few of iHeartMedia's stations, primarily secondary to its main news talk stations, and usually feature at least one local host with [[Dial Global]] programming; [[Air America Radio]] also aired on these stations. iHeartMedia has shown a tendency to drop liberal talk affiliations due to lack of ratings or advertiser support and replace it with sports talk or other formats (see, for instance, [[WCKY (AM)|WCKY]], [[WARF]], [[KLSD]], [[WXKS (AM)|WXKS]], and [[WINZ (AM)|WINZ]]); in one case this had caused a protest when iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) wanted to change [[WXXM]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] to a sports format. WXXM was eventually allowed to keep its liberal format, though they eventually retired it in November 2016 due to a general lack of syndicated programming for that format.\n\niHeartMedia has been active in the national trend of simulcasting its AM news/talk stations on full-power FM stations, hoping to preserve their long-term viability while AM radio declines. Examples include [[San Diego]], [[California]], on KUSS 95.7 (which became [[KSSX|KOGO-FM]] after simulcasting [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO-AM]], replacing [[country music]]), [[Sacramento, California]] on KGBY 92.5 (which became [[KFBK-FM]] after simulcasting [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]], replacing [[hot adult contemporary]]), in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on KTZR-FM (which became [[KYWD|KNST-FM]] after simulcasting [[KNST]], replacing Spanish top 40), in [[Schenectady, New York]] ([[WGY-FM]]/103.1, simulcasting [[WGY (AM)|WGY]]/810, replacing rock WHRL) and [[Syracuse, New York]] ([[WSYR-FM]]/106.9 simulcasting [[WSYR (AM)|WSYR]]/570, displacing urban AC \"Power\" to [[WHEN (AM)|WHEN]]/620). After failing to see any significant ratings gains from these moves, Clear Channel showed signs of abandoning this strategy when it changed KNST-FM to country music in February 2013 as [[KYWD]].\n\n===Sports talk stations===\nMost sports talk stations owned by iHeartMedia are affiliated with [[Fox Sports Radio]]. They are usually branded either ''Fox Sports'' or ''The Sports Animal''. Other sports talk stations are affiliated with rival [[ESPN Radio]] (in this case, [[WUCS]] in Hartford, Connecticut, which is nearby [[ESPN]]'s headquarters in Bristol).\n\n===Adult standards===\nMost of iHeartMedia's adult standards stations are turnkey operations, running a direct feed of a satellite format such as [[Dial Global]]'s [[America's Best Music]] or [[Music of Your Life]]. Most of these stations have no local jocks or Web sites. The network has few remaining stations in that category and has sold off many of them.\n\n===Adult contemporary===\niHeartMedia's [[adult contemporary]] stations are often branded as \"Lite FM\" (i.e. [[WLIT]] in Chicago or [[WLTW]] in New York, ) or \"Sunny\", although some stations use \"Magic\", \"B\" or something else similar as their identifiers, As of 2018, \"The Breeze\" has bought a new resurgence in Soft AC, targeted towards millennial listeners. Evenings are usually filled with [[Delilah Rene|Delilah]], unless that show is already aired by another station, in which case the [[John Tesh Radio Show]] is often substituted. Automated programming is the next option for the 7<small>PM</small>- 12 <small>AM</small> timeslot. ''Your Weekend with [[Jim Brickman]]'' and the in-house ''[[American Top 40]] the 1970s (or 1980s) with [[Casey Kasem]]'' are popular weekend syndicated programs on iHeartMedia stations. Most AC stations air [[Christmas music]] from the last week of November to Christmas Day. Some AC iHeartMedia stations are almost famous for playing [[Christmas music]] as early as November 1 such as [[KOSY-FM]] in [[Salt Lake City]] before they flipped to mainstream rock or [[WLKO]] playing its first Christmas song of the season 2\u20133 weeks before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. 2/3 of iHeartMedia stations that play Adult contemporary air Christmas formats.\n\nHot adult contemporary stations are usually branded as \"Mix\", \"Star\" or \"MYfm\" (i.e. [[KBIG]] in Los Angeles). Some Hot AC stations lean modern rock while others lean toward adult rock. Other Hot AC stations have other brandings such as \"Wild 105.7 and 96.7\" on [[WRDA (FM)|WRDA]] in [[Atlanta]].\n\n===Contemporary hit radio===\niHeartMedia's CHR stations share a number of common brands, including \"[[KISS-FM (brand)|KISS-FM]]\" (e.g., [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] Los Angeles, [[WKSC-FM]] Chicago, [[WAKS]] Cleveland, [[WFKS]] Melbourne, [[WXKS-FM]] Boston), \"Z\" (e.g., [[WHTZ]] New York, [[KKRZ]] Portland Oregon [[WZFT]] Baltimore, [[KSLZ]] St. Louis), \"Wild\" (e.g., [[WLDI]] West Palm Beach, [[KYLD]] San Francisco), \"Power\" ([[WWPW]] Atlanta, [[WGEX]] Albany, Georgia), Channel (e.g., [[WKQI]] Detroit, [[WHQC]] Charlotte, [[KHTS-FM]] San Diego, [[WCHD]] Dayton-Springfield), or \"Hot\" (e.g., [[WIHT]] in Washington, D.C., [[WWHT]] in Syracuse, NY). Other brands, less commonly used, includes \"Radio Now\" ([[WRNW]] Milwaukee, [[WNRW]] Louisville), \"Q\" ([[WIOQ]] Philadelphia-102.1 FM-Q102, [[WQGA]] Waycross-Brunswick, Georgia-103.3 FM-103Q), \"B\" ([[WAEB-FM]] B 104 Allentown-Reading PA 104.1 FM), \"FM\" ([[WLAN-FM]] FM 97 96.9 FM Lancaster-Reading), \"V\" ([[WVRT]]& [[WVRZ]] V-97 Williamsport-Lock Haven, Pennsylvania), \"Max\" ([[WHCY]] Max 106.3 Sussex), \"K.C.\" ([[WKCI-FM]] KC 101, 101.3 FM, Hamden-New Haven, Connecticut/Long Island, New York) and \"X\" ([[WJMX-FM]] 103X, 103.3 FM Cheraw-Florence, South Carolina/The Pee Dee). Still other branding can be heard, however, when a preferred format name is already in use by another station in the market.\n\nAlthough a majority of these stations features a broad-based, mass appeal music presentation, several stations like [[WSNX]]/Grand Rapids and [[WKTU]]/New York City tend to lean towards Rhythmic material due to having a sister station in the same format (WKTU's sister is WHTZ) or a lack of a Rhythmic or R&B/Hip-Hop outlet (a void which WSNX also tries to fill).\n\nMany iHeartMedia CHR stations utilize syndicated morning shows, such as ''[[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show]]'' based out of [[WHTZ]], New Jersey/New York's Z100 and ''Johnjay & Rich'' based out of [[KZZP]] Phoenix, Arizona (especially in the Rocky Mountain states). Some East Coast CHR stations carry ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'' (based out of [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] in Los Angeles) middays. On weekends, syndicated programming includes ''[[American Top 40]] with [[Ryan Seacrest]]''.\n\n===Country music===\n[[Country music]] stations owned by iHeartMedia have begun transitioning to \"The Bull\" like [[KSD (FM)]] in St. Louis and \"Big\" like [[WEBG]] in Chicago as national brandings as of 2014. They almost universally carry ''After Midnite'', the syndicated overnight program currently hosted by Cody Alan, and often carry [[Bobby Bones (broadcaster)|Bobby Bones]]'s morning show as well.\n\n===Oldies and classic hits===\niHeartMedia's [[Oldies]] stations consists largely of FM stations with some AM stations. iHeartMedia uses brands such as \"Big\" and \"Kool\" on many of its stations. Nearly all of the FM stations play oldies spanning from 1964 to 1975, with a 500-song active playlist split nearly half 1960s and half 1970s. The playlist also includes approximately a dozen pre 1964 tracks and around 50 songs from the late 1970s and early 1980s. These stations generally have a few local live announcers; much of the time these stations are voicetracked either locally or from another market. Most run syndicated programming on weekends, such as [[Dick Bartley]] or Mike Harvey on Saturday nights, Steve Goddard's programs (''Goddard's Gold'' and/or ''The 70s''), and recently, ''[[Casey Kasem]]'s [[American Top 40]]: The 70s''. A handful of iHeartMedia's outlets have picked up syndicated weeknight fare, such as Mike Harvey, Marty Thompson or [[Tom Kent]].\n\nThe AM oldies stations' playlists skew somewhat older and span from 1955 to about 1975. About 60 percent of the time they play 1964 to 1969 oldies, 20 percent pre 1964 oldies, and 20 percent music from the 1970s. Some of these also run Dick Bartley or Mike Harvey on Saturday nights. Some of the AM stations also run adult standards several hours on the weekend as well as limited specialized programming focusing on the pre 1964 era. Most of the AM stations are in smaller markets.\n\n===Rock===\niHeartMedia stations programming a rock format tend to play a blend of new rock and harder classic rock. Some carry ''[[Nights with Alice Cooper]]'' in the evenings while some others air ''[[Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx]]''. These stations tend to be live during the day and voicetracked at night. Some stations run ''[[Rockline]]'' with [[Bob Coburn]] and/or ''[[Little Steven's Underground Garage]]'' as well.\n\nWhile iHeartMedia classic rock stations operate under a wide variety of monikers, many are branded as \"[[The Fox (brand)|The Fox]]\" or \"[[The Brew (brand)|The Brew]]\". Often, these stations will carry [[Bob and Tom]] in morning drive. In the [[Southern United States]], ''[[John Boy and Billy]]'' is carried instead in most cases. (Both of the aforementioned shows are syndicated by Premiere.) Other shows include the ''Walton and Johnson Show'' out of Houston and Rover's Morning Glory out of Cleveland. Starting with WQBW Milwaukee (which has since switched to another format) and WBWR Columbus, several iHeartMedia stations have adopted a 1980s-centered classic rock approach called \"The Brew.\"\n\n===Spanish===\nIn a few markets, iHeartMedia has an FM station carrying Hispanic programming full-time. In some markets the format is a Contemporary Tropical format while in others the format carried is more of a Mexican format. In a few markets an iHeartMedia FM station carries a rap based Spanish format known as [[Hurban]], which blends Spanish dance music with rhythm and blues hits as well as some Hip Hop. The division is run by Spanish radio executive [[Alfredo Alonso]], who joined iHeartMedia in September 2004 (when it still was called Clear Channel) as Senior Vice President of Hispanic Radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/09/13/daily25.html?jst=s_cn_hl-|title=Clear Channel Radio joins pursuit of Hispanic listeners|work=Puget Sound Business Journal|access-date=2017-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040719/http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/09/13/daily25.html?jst=s_cn_hl-|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Religious===\nIn a few markets, iHeartMedia has a religious station on the AM band. Some of these sell blocks of time to outside organizations and have no local shows at all except where local churches buy time. These are formatted similarly to [[Salem Media]] stations.\n\nThe other type of religious format iHeartMedia uses in a few markets is a [[Gospel music]] based format. On these stations Gospel Music appealing to black Americans airs most of the time along with some block programming sold to religious groups. These stations are often programmed as urban stations that happen to be religious.\n\n===Specialties===\nIHeartMedia has one station in [[Hawaii]], [[KDNN]]/[[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu]], programming a Contemporary Hawaiian Hits/Reggae format, along with an accompanying HD2 sub channel that features traditional Hawaiian music. Multicultural programming can also be heard on AM stations that iHeartMedia owns or has LMAs with. In March 2019, its [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] outlet, [[WSAN]], launched an all-podcast format. In November 2019, [[K256AS]]/[[KUCD]]-HD2 in Honolulu launched a variant Top 40 format with a focus on [[K-pop]] and other international pop hits.\n\n==Syndicated programs==\n: ''See [[List of programming syndicated by iHeartMedia]]''\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Market share===\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the company became an object of persistent criticism.<ref>Klinenberg, Eric.

''Right of the Dial: The Rise of Clear Channel and the Fall of Commercial Radio''. Faber and Faber, 2008</ref> FCC regulations were relaxed following the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], allowing companies to own far more radio stations than before. After spending about $30 billion, Clear Channel owned over 1,200 stations nationwide, including as many as eight stations in certain markets. Although \"media reform\" social movement organizations like [[Future of Music Coalition]] mobilized against Clear Channel, so far the company has been able to hold on to all of its stations after divesting a few following the acquisition of AMFM, although over 500 stations have since been sold or are in the process of being sold since the company announced plans to become privately held.\n\n===September 11, 2001===\n{{Main|Clear Channel memorandum}}\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]] on New York and [[The Pentagon]], radio stations circulated a list of songs that were deemed inappropriate for broadcast during the time of national mourning following the attacks. A small list was initially generated by the Clear Channel office on Thursday, September 13, 2001,<ref>In 2001, Jack Evans, regional senior VP of programming at Clear Channel, attributed the creation of the list to individual program directors rather than management; however, the completed list was distributed to the program directors by management at Clear Channel.

Clear Channel denies that this was a list of banned songs, claiming it was a list of titles that should be played only after great thought. Also WOFX, Cincinnati, owned by Clear Channel at the time continued to play songs that were on the alleged list, even though radio headquarters was in Cincinnati at the time.<ref name=\"CC-PR\">{{cite press release |title=Clear Channel Says National \"Banned Playlist\" Does Not Exist |publisher=Clear Channel Communications, Inc. |date=2001-09-18 |url=http://content.clearchannel.com/corporate/article/NationalBannedPlaylist.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923200949/http://content.clearchannel.com/corporate/article/NationalBannedPlaylist.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 23, 2002 |access-date=2008-08-03 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Songs on the list included [[Tom Petty]]'s \"[[Free Fallin']]\", [[Louis Armstrong]]'s \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\" and the entire [[Rage Against the Machine discography]].\n\n===Live music recordings===\nIn 2004, Clear Channel acquired a key patent in the process of producing [[Instant Live]] recordings, in which a live performance is recorded directly from the sound engineer's console during the show, and then rapidly burned on [[CD]] so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue. This had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist, venue, and promoter, as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] concert recordings made by audience members. However, some media critics, as well as smaller business rivals, believed that Clear Channel was using the patent (on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks ''during recording'', so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track) to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees, even if they do not use precisely the same process. The patent was transferred to [[Live Nation]] when [[Clear Channel Entertainment]] was spun off, but the patent was revoked on March 13, 2007,<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2007/03/12|date=2007-03-13|title=EFF Kills Bogus Clear Channel Patent|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|access-date=2016-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909095922/https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2007/03/12|archive-date=September 9, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> after it was found that this patent infringed on a prior patent granted for [[Telex Communications|Telex]].\n\n===Indecency zero tolerance===\nDuring the nationwide crackdown on indecent material following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in 2004]], Clear Channel launched a \"self-policing\" effort, and declared that there would be no \"indecent\" material allowed on the air.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> This led to the company's dismissal of several of their own employees, including popular and high-profile hosts in a number of cities. There were protests from free-speech advocates. During the same period, [[Howard Stern]] was dropped from six Clear Channel-owned stations in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, New York and Kentucky. By mid-year, rival [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (through radio division [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]], and the original Viacom, not the [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|current one]]) brought Stern's show back to those six markets. In June 2004, Viacom/Infinity Broadcasting Inc./One Twelve Inc. filed a $10 million lawsuit against Clear Channel for breaking of contracts and non-payment of licensing fees due to the dropping of Stern's show. (Viacom was Howard Stern's employer at the time, though he has since moved to [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM Satellite Radio]].) The following July, Clear Channel filed a countersuit of $3 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-02-25-clearchannel-decency_x.htm?csp=34 |work=USA Today |title=Clear Channel adopts 'zero-tolerance' indecency policy |date=February 25, 2004 |access-date=August 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016060125/http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-02-25-clearchannel-decency_x.htm?csp=34 |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Concerts===\nIn the early 2000s, Clear Channel settled a lawsuit with a [[Denver, Colorado]] concert promoter, Nobody In Particular Presents (NIPP).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In the lawsuit, NIPP alleged that Clear Channel halted airplay on its local stations for (NIPP) clients, and that Clear Channel would not allow NIPP to publicize its concerts on the air. The lawsuit was settled in 2004 when Clear Channel agreed to pay NIPP a confidential sum. However, a systematic analysis of concert ticket prices found no evidence that Clear Channel was cross-leveraging its radio interests with its (now divested) concert promotion interests.<ref>Alan B.

City officials attempted to contact the local Clear Channel office by telephone to spread warnings of the danger using its radio stations, but it was several critical hours before the station manager was finally reached at his home. In the meantime, [[9-1-1]] operators were advising panicked callers to tune to [[KCJB]] for emergency instructions, but the station was not broadcasting any such information.<ref name=\"Now\">{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/25/exclusive_911_calls_in_north_dakota|title=Exclusive... 911 Calls in North Dakota Town Reveal Dangers of Media Consolidation|publisher=Democracy Now|date=25 January 2007|access-date=November 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206055034/http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/25/exclusive_911_calls_in_north_dakota|archive-date=December 6, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe ammonia spill was the largest of its kind in the United States, with one person killed, and over 1,000 seeking medical attention.

St. Pete Pride has stated that throughout its eight-year history, Clear Channel has edited the organization's advertising material, and questioned whether the rejection of these images were because they displayed same-sex couples in affectionate poses.

It owned more than 40 additional stations, a few of which are independent (non-network affiliates). In 2007, the company entered into an agreement to sell all its television stations to [[Providence Equity Partners]] for $1.2 billion,<ref name=\"Clear-Channel-Communications-Apr-2007-8-K\" /> a deal that eventually closed in March 2008.<ref name=\"Clear-Channel-Communications-Mar-2008-8-K\" /> All former Clear Channel television stations were owned by [[Newport Television]], while the other six were flipped to other buyers by Newport. In 2012 to mid-2013, Newport sold off all of its holdings to several other television groups, including [[News-Press & Gazette Company]], [[Cox Media Group]], [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting]] and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]].\n\n===Music charts===\niHeartMedia owns [[Mediabase]], which provide music charts based on songs and tracks receiving the most spins played on radio stations in the United States and Canada. A majority of stations that report to Mediabase are iHeartMedia outlets but other companies also report to the Mediabase charts.

In addition, iHeartMedia syndicates a number of its homegrown talk and music shows without the aid of Premiere. While Premiere actively sells its shows to stations, the non-Premiere syndicated shows are often used as a cost-cutting measure and do not have a large sales staff. Those shows also do not carry network-wide advertising (unless distributed by a third party), and allow the affiliates to keep all local spots, which increases their appeal. These networks carry many program hosts of various political ideologies and distribute a variety of programs to both iHeartMedia-owned and non-iHeartMedia-owned stations.\n\nIn addition to its own syndication network, iHeartMedia offers studio space and other services to the [[WestStar TalkRadio Network]], which is based at iHeartMedia's studios in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. As a result, many WestStar programs are heard on iHeartMedia stations.\n\nNot all programming heard on iHeartMedia's radio stations are produced in house; however, most of iHeartMedia's stations share many similarities to each other in branding and programming.\n\n===Format Lab and HD2 Formats===\n{{Main|iHeartRadio}}\nThe '''Format Lab''' was a radio programming think tank conceived, built and managed by Michael Albl for Clear Channel (now known as iHeartMedia) that produced 84 formats for use on AM/FM/HD/XM/Stream/Mobile. The formats ranged from mainstream formats, music genre niches, lifestyles to the highly experimental. These formats were heard on most of Clear Channel's [[HD Radio]] subchannels, on SiriusXM, Sprint MSpot and used as the original music streaming service for Clear Channel Online Music and Radio (CCOMR). In 2009, the Format Lab split into two programming services (1) Terrestrial Radio known as Premium Choice and (2) iHeartRadio online streaming.\n\n===iHeartRadio===\n{{Main|iHeartRadio}}\n'''iHeartRadio''' is a free broadcast, podcast and [[streaming radio]] [[Computing platform|platform]]. It is also the national umbrella brand for iHeartMedia's radio network aggregating its over 850 local iHeartMedia radio stations across the United States, as well as hundreds of other stations from various other media.\n\n===Alternative stations===\niHeartMedia Alternative Stations usually are branded as \"Radio\" (such as [[WRFF|Radio 104.5]] in Philadelphia or [[WRDA (FM)|Radio 105.7]]/[[WRDG|96.7]] in Atlanta), or \"ALT\" ([[KYSR|Alt 98.7]] in Los Angeles, and [[KLLT (FM)|Alt 104.9]] in St. Louis). Others include: The Edge, The Buzz, The Project, Star, or X. Their flagship Premium Choice Alternative Station is The Alternative Project broadcasting on WAXQ-FM 104.3 HD-2 in New York City. ''The Woody Show'', which originates from KYSR, serves as the anchor morning show for the iHeartMedia Alternative outlets.\n\n===Urban, urban AC and rhythmic stations===\nStations that carry programming catering to black Americans are a big part of many iHeartMedia clusters, particularly Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit. In many clusters iHeartMedia has two or more such stations. About half the Urban stations focus on Rap and Hip Hop along with younger [[rhythm and blues]] sounds. The other half blend some younger rhythm and blues along with some Soul from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s along with some current product. Some of the Hip Hop-based Urban stations report as Rhythmic Top 40 stations rather than Urban stations because these stations also have some appeal to white and Hispanic listeners. In a cluster with multiple urban stations owned by iHeartMedia, one is focused on Rap while the other is focused on Soul. Examples include Philadelphia, with [[WUSL]]'s focus on hip hop while [[WDAS-FM]] focuses on Soul (in addition, the company also owns a rhythmic AC station in that area, which is [[WISX]] 106.1), and Chicago, where [[WGCI-FM]] focuses on rap while [[WVAZ]] is focused on Soul. iHeartMedia urban and urban AC stations are branded as \"Real\" ([[KRRL]] Los Angeles), \"Beat\" ([[KQBT]]/Houston, [[WBTP]] [[Tampa]]) or \"Power\" ([[WWPR-FM|WWPR]] New York City, [[WUSL]] [[Philadelphia]] and [[WHEN (AM)|WHEN]] [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]). In San Francisco, iHeartMedia owned more urban-related stations such as Rhythmic Top 40 KYLD, [[urban oldies]] [[KISQ]], and [[urban contemporary]] [[KMEL]] in that area (KYLD shifted to Top 40/CHR in 2015, KISQ flipped to AC in 2016), and the same happened in [[Detroit]], where the company also owns [[urban AC]] [[WMXD]], [[urban contemporary]] [[WJLB]] and former [[rhythmic AC]] WDTW-FM (now [[WLLZ (FM)|WLLZ]]). iHeart also have Urban outlets with heritage and familiarity based on the markets they serve, like [[WHRK]] and [[WDIA]] in Memphis, and [[WKKV]] in Milwaukee.\n\nAnother growing format, Classic Hip-Hop/Throwback/Old School (consisting of R&B/Hip-Hop, Rap, and Rhythmic songs from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), can be heard full-time on iHeartRadio, as well as [[KATZ-FM]]/St. Louis and [[K256AS|KUBT-HD2 & its translator]] in Honolulu. Previously, this format was originated as Rhythmic Oldies, which was launched at KCMG/Los Angeles and later spread to more markets before the former Clear Channel flipped several stations out of the format by the mid-2000s.\n\nFor the Rhythmic Top 40 format, similar brandings include \"The Beat\" ([[KUBT]]/Honolulu and [[WBTT]]/Ft. Myers), [[KPRR|Power 102]]/El Paso, [[KKMY|104.5 Kiss FM]]/[[Beaumont, Texas]], \"Jam'n\" ([[KXJM]]/Portland Oregon, [[KSSX]]/San Diego, and [[WJMN-FM]]/Boston; a similar \"Jammin'\" is used at [[WSTV (FM)|WSTV]]/Roanoke & [[WJJX]]/Lynchburg). A \"B\" has been used at [[KBOS-FM|B95]]/Fresno since the 1980s. Others Rhythmics, such as [[KUBE (FM)|KUBE]]/Seattle, [[KDON-FM]]/Salinas-Monterey and [[KGGI]]/Riverside-San Bernardino, simply use the call letters and/or frequency. Most of these stations target a multicultural audience and play Rhythmic Pop, R&B/Hip-Hop, and Dance tracks.\n\nFor rhythmic AC stations, they used to have the \"Party\" branding (particularly during the time when most used ''[[Wake Up with Whoopi]]'' as their morning show), but the two \"Party\" stations in [[Denver]] ([[KPTT]]) and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] ([[KYMT]], the former KPLV) have since exited the [[rhythmic AC]] format. KPTT and KPLV moved to top 40, but continue to use the \"Party\" branding (KPLV is currently Variety Hits). All iHeartMedia rhythmic AC stations are now differently branded per station, although one of the outlets, [[WMOV-FM]]/Norfolk, uses the \"[[Movin' (brand)|Movin']]\" moniker which is trademarked under another company (that station has since shifted to Rhythmic Top 40). ''The Breakfast Club Morning Show'' out of [[WWPR-FM]] in New York and \"Big Boy's Neighborhood\" out of KRRL in Los Angeles are iHeartMedia's syndicated urban morning shows.\n\n===Smooth jazz===\nAs noted earlier, iHeartMedia has the Smooth Jazz Network (aka Your Smooth Jazz), which is programmed by Broadcast Architecture. Unless otherwise noted, all Smooth Jazz Network stations will carry the following schedule: [[Kenny G]] and Sandy Kovach in morning drive time, Miranda Wilson in midday, Allen Kepler in afternoon drive time, and Maria Lopez in evenings, with no disc jockeys overnight. Weekend programming consists of the Smooth Jazz Top 20 with Allen Kepler, as well as the [[Dave Koz]] Radio Show.\n\n===Dance and EDM===\nAlthough they have no full-powered stations programming a Dance or EDM (Electronic Dance Music) format, iHeartMedia has FM translators and HD2 platforms broadcasting the EDM-intensive [[Evolution (HD radio)|Evolution]] platform, while the LGBT community is served by the more broader-based [[Pride Radio (HD)|Pride Radio]]. However, iHeartMedia's Top 40/CHR and Rhythmic Top 40 outlets incorporate a majority of Dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows. A weekly countdown program, ''America\u2019s Dance 30'', airs on selected iHeart Top 40 and Rhythmic stations.\n\n===News talk stations===\nNews talk stations owned by iHeartMedia usually have a standard slate of hosts. The morning show is usually local, with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts. Programs that appear on many iHeartMedia talk stations include the ''[[Glenn Beck Program]]'' (Beck having gotten his talk show start at iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) owned [[WFLA (AM)|WFLA-AM]] in Tampa), ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', ''[[The Sean Hannity Show]]'', ''[[America Now with Andy Dean|America Now with Meghan McCain]]'' and ''[[Coast to Coast AM]] with George Noory'', all of which are affiliated with [[Premiere Radio Networks]] in some fashion. ''The [[Mark Levin]] Show'' and ''[[The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show]]'' are non-Premiere shows who air on many (if not most) iHeartMedia stations, as did ''[[The Savage Nation]]'' prior to its ending in September 2012. Limbaugh is almost universally carried on iHeartMedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station, including recently New York City: [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] was acquired in 2013 by Clear Channel and began carrying Limbaugh's program in 2014 following a long relationship with now-[[Cumulus Media]]-owned [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]. In markets where iHeartMedia-owned news talk stations have not been profitable (such as [[WXKS (AM)|Boston]] and [[WGST|Atlanta]]), iHeartMedia has chosen to sell shows such as Limbaugh and ''Coast to Coast AM'' to their rivals and change the stations to other formats.\n\nWhile most of iHeartMedia's news/talk stations carry some combination of Beck, Limbaugh, Hannity and Noory (of ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''), this is not always the case. Many stations (particularly in the larger markets) like [[KFI]], [[KFYI]], [[KOA (AM)|KOA]], [[WZZR]] and [[WLW]] broadcast a lineup with significant local programming.\n\niHeartMedia does not operate any [[all-news radio]] stations. For a brief time in the late 2000s, [[KFXR (AM)|KFXR]] in Dallas ran a direct feed of [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]] under the on-air name ''CNN 1190'', but KFXR dropped that format in 2009. Almost all of iHeartMedia's primary talk stations are affiliated with [[Fox News Radio]] for national news, part of a multi-year deal between iHeartMedia and Fox. However, since 2012 iHeartMedia has provided an all-news feed called 24/7 News. This radio network is exclusive to iHeartRadio. Since 2016, 24/7 News partners with [[NBC News]] to launch the [[NBC News Radio]].\n\n[[Liberal talk radio]] is heard on a few of iHeartMedia's stations, primarily secondary to its main news talk stations, and usually feature at least one local host with [[Dial Global]] programming; [[Air America Radio]] also aired on these stations. iHeartMedia has shown a tendency to drop liberal talk affiliations due to lack of ratings or advertiser support and replace it with sports talk or other formats (see, for instance, [[WCKY (AM)|WCKY]], [[WARF]], [[KLSD]], [[WXKS (AM)|WXKS]], and [[WINZ (AM)|WINZ]]); in one case this had caused a protest when iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) wanted to change [[WXXM]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] to a sports format. WXXM was eventually allowed to keep its liberal format, though they eventually retired it in November 2016 due to a general lack of syndicated programming for that format.\n\niHeartMedia has been active in the national trend of simulcasting its AM news/talk stations on full-power FM stations, hoping to preserve their long-term viability while AM radio declines. Examples include [[San Diego]], [[California]], on KUSS 95.7 (which became [[KSSX|KOGO-FM]] after simulcasting [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO-AM]], replacing [[country music]]), [[Sacramento, California]] on KGBY 92.5 (which became [[KFBK-FM]] after simulcasting [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]], replacing [[hot adult contemporary]]), in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on KTZR-FM (which became [[KYWD|KNST-FM]] after simulcasting [[KNST]], replacing Spanish top 40), in [[Schenectady, New York]] ([[WGY-FM]]/103.1, simulcasting [[WGY (AM)|WGY]]/810, replacing rock WHRL) and [[Syracuse, New York]] ([[WSYR-FM]]/106.9 simulcasting [[WSYR (AM)|WSYR]]/570, displacing urban AC \"Power\" to [[WHEN (AM)|WHEN]]/620). After failing to see any significant ratings gains from these moves, Clear Channel showed signs of abandoning this strategy when it changed KNST-FM to country music in February 2013 as [[KYWD]].\n\n===Sports talk stations===\nMost sports talk stations owned by iHeartMedia are affiliated with [[Fox Sports Radio]]. They are usually branded either ''Fox Sports'' or ''The Sports Animal''. Other sports talk stations are affiliated with rival [[ESPN Radio]] (in this case, [[WUCS]] in Hartford, Connecticut, which is nearby [[ESPN]]'s headquarters in Bristol).\n\n===Adult standards===\nMost of iHeartMedia's adult standards stations are turnkey operations, running a direct feed of a satellite format such as [[Dial Global]]'s [[America's Best Music]] or [[Music of Your Life]]. Most of these stations have no local jocks or Web sites. The network has few remaining stations in that category and has sold off many of them.\n\n===Adult contemporary===\niHeartMedia's [[adult contemporary]] stations are often branded as \"Lite FM\" (i.e. [[WLIT]] in Chicago or [[WLTW]] in New York, ) or \"Sunny\", although some stations use \"Magic\", \"B\" or something else similar as their identifiers, As of 2018, \"The Breeze\" has bought a new resurgence in Soft AC, targeted towards millennial listeners. Evenings are usually filled with [[Delilah Rene|Delilah]], unless that show is already aired by another station, in which case the [[John Tesh Radio Show]] is often substituted. Automated programming is the next option for the 7<small>PM</small>- 12 <small>AM</small> timeslot. ''Your Weekend with [[Jim Brickman]]'' and the in-house ''[[American Top 40]] the 1970s (or 1980s) with [[Casey Kasem]]'' are popular weekend syndicated programs on iHeartMedia stations. Most AC stations air [[Christmas music]] from the last week of November to Christmas Day. Some AC iHeartMedia stations are almost famous for playing [[Christmas music]] as early as November 1 such as [[KOSY-FM]] in [[Salt Lake City]] before they flipped to mainstream rock or [[WLKO]] playing its first Christmas song of the season 2\u20133 weeks before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. 2/3 of iHeartMedia stations that play Adult contemporary air Christmas formats.\n\nHot adult contemporary stations are usually branded as \"Mix\", \"Star\" or \"MYfm\" (i.e. [[KBIG]] in Los Angeles). Some Hot AC stations lean modern rock while others lean toward adult rock. Other Hot AC stations have other brandings such as \"Wild 105.7 and 96.7\" on [[WRDA (FM)|WRDA]] in [[Atlanta]].\n\n===Contemporary hit radio===\niHeartMedia's CHR stations share a number of common brands, including \"[[KISS-FM (brand)|KISS-FM]]\" (e.g., [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] Los Angeles, [[WKSC-FM]] Chicago, [[WAKS]] Cleveland, [[WFKS]] Melbourne, [[WXKS-FM]] Boston), \"Z\" (e.g., [[WHTZ]] New York, [[KKRZ]] Portland Oregon [[WZFT]] Baltimore, [[KSLZ]] St. Louis), \"Wild\" (e.g., [[WLDI]] West Palm Beach, [[KYLD]] San Francisco), \"Power\" ([[WWPW]] Atlanta, [[WGEX]] Albany, Georgia), Channel (e.g., [[WKQI]] Detroit, [[WHQC]] Charlotte, [[KHTS-FM]] San Diego, [[WCHD]] Dayton-Springfield), or \"Hot\" (e.g., [[WIHT]] in Washington, D.C., [[WWHT]] in Syracuse, NY). Other brands, less commonly used, includes \"Radio Now\" ([[WRNW]] Milwaukee, [[WNRW]] Louisville), \"Q\" ([[WIOQ]] Philadelphia-102.1 FM-Q102, [[WQGA]] Waycross-Brunswick, Georgia-103.3 FM-103Q), \"B\" ([[WAEB-FM]] B 104 Allentown-Reading PA 104.1 FM), \"FM\" ([[WLAN-FM]] FM 97 96.9 FM Lancaster-Reading), \"V\" ([[WVRT]]& [[WVRZ]] V-97 Williamsport-Lock Haven, Pennsylvania), \"Max\" ([[WHCY]] Max 106.3 Sussex), \"K.C.\" ([[WKCI-FM]] KC 101, 101.3 FM, Hamden-New Haven, Connecticut/Long Island, New York) and \"X\" ([[WJMX-FM]] 103X, 103.3 FM Cheraw-Florence, South Carolina/The Pee Dee). Still other branding can be heard, however, when a preferred format name is already in use by another station in the market.\n\nAlthough a majority of these stations features a broad-based, mass appeal music presentation, several stations like [[WSNX]]/Grand Rapids and [[WKTU]]/New York City tend to lean towards Rhythmic material due to having a sister station in the same format (WKTU's sister is WHTZ) or a lack of a Rhythmic or R&B/Hip-Hop outlet (a void which WSNX also tries to fill).\n\nMany iHeartMedia CHR stations utilize syndicated morning shows, such as ''[[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show]]'' based out of [[WHTZ]], New Jersey/New York's Z100 and ''Johnjay & Rich'' based out of [[KZZP]] Phoenix, Arizona (especially in the Rocky Mountain states). Some East Coast CHR stations carry ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'' (based out of [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] in Los Angeles) middays. On weekends, syndicated programming includes ''[[American Top 40]] with [[Ryan Seacrest]]''.\n\n===Country music===\n[[Country music]] stations owned by iHeartMedia have begun transitioning to \"The Bull\" like [[KSD (FM)]] in St. Louis and \"Big\" like [[WEBG]] in Chicago as national brandings as of 2014. They almost universally carry ''After Midnite'', the syndicated overnight program currently hosted by Cody Alan, and often carry [[Bobby Bones (broadcaster)|Bobby Bones]]'s morning show as well.\n\n===Oldies and classic hits===\niHeartMedia's [[Oldies]] stations consists largely of FM stations with some AM stations. iHeartMedia uses brands such as \"Big\" and \"Kool\" on many of its stations. Nearly all of the FM stations play oldies spanning from 1964 to 1975, with a 500-song active playlist split nearly half 1960s and half 1970s. The playlist also includes approximately a dozen pre 1964 tracks and around 50 songs from the late 1970s and early 1980s. These stations generally have a few local live announcers; much of the time these stations are voicetracked either locally or from another market. Most run syndicated programming on weekends, such as [[Dick Bartley]] or Mike Harvey on Saturday nights, Steve Goddard's programs (''Goddard's Gold'' and/or ''The 70s''), and recently, ''[[Casey Kasem]]'s [[American Top 40]]: The 70s''. A handful of iHeartMedia's outlets have picked up syndicated weeknight fare, such as Mike Harvey, Marty Thompson or [[Tom Kent]].\n\nThe AM oldies stations' playlists skew somewhat older and span from 1955 to about 1975. About 60 percent of the time they play 1964 to 1969 oldies, 20 percent pre 1964 oldies, and 20 percent music from the 1970s. Some of these also run Dick Bartley or Mike Harvey on Saturday nights. Some of the AM stations also run adult standards several hours on the weekend as well as limited specialized programming focusing on the pre 1964 era. Most of the AM stations are in smaller markets.\n\n===Rock===\niHeartMedia stations programming a rock format tend to play a blend of new rock and harder classic rock. Some carry ''[[Nights with Alice Cooper]]'' in the evenings while some others air ''[[Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx]]''. These stations tend to be live during the day and voicetracked at night. Some stations run ''[[Rockline]]'' with [[Bob Coburn]] and/or ''[[Little Steven's Underground Garage]]'' as well.\n\nWhile iHeartMedia classic rock stations operate under a wide variety of monikers, many are branded as \"[[The Fox (brand)|The Fox]]\" or \"[[The Brew (brand)|The Brew]]\". Often, these stations will carry [[Bob and Tom]] in morning drive. In the [[Southern United States]], ''[[John Boy and Billy]]'' is carried instead in most cases. (Both of the aforementioned shows are syndicated by Premiere.) Other shows include the ''Walton and Johnson Show'' out of Houston and Rover's Morning Glory out of Cleveland. Starting with WQBW Milwaukee (which has since switched to another format) and WBWR Columbus, several iHeartMedia stations have adopted a 1980s-centered classic rock approach called \"The Brew.\"\n\n===Spanish===\nIn a few markets, iHeartMedia has an FM station carrying Hispanic programming full-time. In some markets the format is a Contemporary Tropical format while in others the format carried is more of a Mexican format. In a few markets an iHeartMedia FM station carries a rap based Spanish format known as [[Hurban]], which blends Spanish dance music with rhythm and blues hits as well as some Hip Hop. The division is run by Spanish radio executive [[Alfredo Alonso]], who joined iHeartMedia in September 2004 (when it still was called Clear Channel) as Senior Vice President of Hispanic Radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/09/13/daily25.html?jst=s_cn_hl-|title=Clear Channel Radio joins pursuit of Hispanic listeners|work=Puget Sound Business Journal|access-date=2017-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040719/http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2004/09/13/daily25.html?jst=s_cn_hl-|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Religious===\nIn a few markets, iHeartMedia has a religious station on the AM band. Some of these sell blocks of time to outside organizations and have no local shows at all except where local churches buy time. These are formatted similarly to [[Salem Media]] stations.\n\nThe other type of religious format iHeartMedia uses in a few markets is a [[Gospel music]] based format. On these stations Gospel Music appealing to black Americans airs most of the time along with some block programming sold to religious groups. These stations are often programmed as urban stations that happen to be religious.\n\n===Specialties===\nIHeartMedia has one station in [[Hawaii]], [[KDNN]]/[[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu]], programming a Contemporary Hawaiian Hits/Reggae format, along with an accompanying HD2 sub channel that features traditional Hawaiian music. Multicultural programming can also be heard on AM stations that iHeartMedia owns or has LMAs with. In March 2019, its [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] outlet, [[WSAN]], launched an all-podcast format. In November 2019, [[K256AS]]/[[KUCD]]-HD2 in Honolulu launched a variant Top 40 format with a focus on [[K-pop]] and other international pop hits.\n\n==Syndicated programs==\n: ''See [[List of programming syndicated by iHeartMedia]]''\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Market share===\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the company became an object of persistent criticism.<ref>Klinenberg, Eric. ''Fighting For Air: The Battle to Control America's Media''. Metropolitan Books, 2007</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Foege, Alec. ''Right of the Dial: The Rise of Clear Channel and the Fall of Commercial Radio''. Faber and Faber, 2008</ref> FCC regulations were relaxed following the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], allowing companies to own far more radio stations than before. After spending about $30 billion, Clear Channel owned over 1,200 stations nationwide, including as many as eight stations in certain markets. Although \"media reform\" social movement organizations like [[Future of Music Coalition]] mobilized against Clear Channel, so far the company has been able to hold on to all of its stations after divesting a few following the acquisition of AMFM, although over 500 stations have since been sold or are in the process of being sold since the company announced plans to become privately held.\n\n===September 11, 2001===\n{{Main|Clear Channel memorandum}}\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]] on New York and [[The Pentagon]], radio stations circulated a list of songs that were deemed inappropriate for broadcast during the time of national mourning following the attacks. A small list was initially generated by the Clear Channel office on Thursday, September 13, 2001,<ref>In 2001, Jack Evans, regional senior VP of programming at Clear Channel, attributed the creation of the list to individual program directors rather than management; however, the completed list was distributed to the program directors by management at Clear Channel.

A list containing about 150 songs was soon published on the [[Internet]]. Some critics suggested that Clear Channel's political preferences played a part in the list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featwishnia_142.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20020405013224/http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featwishnia_142.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2002-04-05|title=lipmagazine.org|publisher=}}</ref> A number of songs were apparently placed on the list because they had specific words such as \"plane\", \"fly\", \"burn\", and \"falling\" in their titles. Clear Channel denies that this was a list of banned songs, claiming it was a list of titles that should be played only after great thought. Also WOFX, Cincinnati, owned by Clear Channel at the time continued to play songs that were on the alleged list, even though radio headquarters was in Cincinnati at the time.<ref name=\"CC-PR\">{{cite press release |title=Clear Channel Says National \"Banned Playlist\" Does Not Exist |publisher=Clear Channel Communications, Inc. |date=2001-09-18 |url=http://content.clearchannel.com/corporate/article/NationalBannedPlaylist.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923200949/http://content.clearchannel.com/corporate/article/NationalBannedPlaylist.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 23, 2002 |access-date=2008-08-03 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Songs on the list included [[Tom Petty]]'s \"[[Free Fallin']]\", [[Louis Armstrong]]'s \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\" and the entire [[Rage Against the Machine discography]].\n\n===Live music recordings===\nIn 2004, Clear Channel acquired a key patent in the process of producing [[Instant Live]] recordings, in which a live performance is recorded directly from the sound engineer's console during the show, and then rapidly burned on [[CD]] so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue. This had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist, venue, and promoter, as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] concert recordings made by audience members. However, some media critics, as well as smaller business rivals, believed that Clear Channel was using the patent (on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks ''during recording'', so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track) to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees, even if they do not use precisely the same process. The patent was transferred to [[Live Nation]] when [[Clear Channel Entertainment]] was spun off, but the patent was revoked on March 13, 2007,<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2007/03/12|date=2007-03-13|title=EFF Kills Bogus Clear Channel Patent|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|access-date=2016-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909095922/https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2007/03/12|archive-date=September 9, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> after it was found that this patent infringed on a prior patent granted for [[Telex Communications|Telex]].\n\n===Indecency zero tolerance===\nDuring the nationwide crackdown on indecent material following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in 2004]], Clear Channel launched a \"self-policing\" effort, and declared that there would be no \"indecent\" material allowed on the air.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> This led to the company's dismissal of several of their own employees, including popular and high-profile hosts in a number of cities. There were protests from free-speech advocates. During the same period, [[Howard Stern]] was dropped from six Clear Channel-owned stations in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, New York and Kentucky. By mid-year, rival [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (through radio division [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]], and the original Viacom, not the [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|current one]]) brought Stern's show back to those six markets. In June 2004, Viacom/Infinity Broadcasting Inc./One Twelve Inc. filed a $10 million lawsuit against Clear Channel for breaking of contracts and non-payment of licensing fees due to the dropping of Stern's show. (Viacom was Howard Stern's employer at the time, though he has since moved to [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM Satellite Radio]].) The following July, Clear Channel filed a countersuit of $3 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-02-25-clearchannel-decency_x.htm?csp=34 |work=USA Today |title=Clear Channel adopts 'zero-tolerance' indecency policy |date=February 25, 2004 |access-date=August 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016060125/http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-02-25-clearchannel-decency_x.htm?csp=34 |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Concerts===\nIn the early 2000s, Clear Channel settled a lawsuit with a [[Denver, Colorado]] concert promoter, Nobody In Particular Presents (NIPP).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In the lawsuit, NIPP alleged that Clear Channel halted airplay on its local stations for (NIPP) clients, and that Clear Channel would not allow NIPP to publicize its concerts on the air. The lawsuit was settled in 2004 when Clear Channel agreed to pay NIPP a confidential sum. However, a systematic analysis of concert ticket prices found no evidence that Clear Channel was cross-leveraging its radio interests with its (now divested) concert promotion interests.<ref>Alan B.

Like most contemporary automation systems, Nex-Gen allows a DJ from anywhere in the country to sound as if he or she is broadcasting from anywhere else in the country, on any other station.<ref name=\"booz\">{{Cite news |first=Mark |last=Washburn |work=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |title=The voice of Charlotte... and Huntsville... and Jackson... |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8847612_ITM |page=1H |date=May 26, 2002 |access-date=November 25, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111223633/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8847612_ITM |archive-date=January 11, 2009 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A technological outgrowth of earlier, tape-based automation systems dating back to the 1960s, this method\u2014known as [[voice-tracking]]\u2014allows for smaller market stations to be partially or completely staffed by \"cyber-jocks\" who may never have visited the town from which they are broadcasting. This practice may also result in local on-air positions being reduced or eliminated. It has been stated that iHeartMedia maintains a majority of its staff in hourly-paid, part-time positions.\n\n===Lack of local staff during emergency===\n{{Main|Minot Train Derailment}}\nClear Channel was criticized for a situation that occurred in [[Minot, North Dakota]], on the morning of January 18, 2002.

City officials attempted to contact the local Clear Channel office by telephone to spread warnings of the danger using its radio stations, but it was several critical hours before the station manager was finally reached at his home. In the meantime, [[9-1-1]] operators were advising panicked callers to tune to [[KCJB]] for emergency instructions, but the station was not broadcasting any such information.<ref name=\"Now\">{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/25/exclusive_911_calls_in_north_dakota|title=Exclusive... 911 Calls in North Dakota Town Reveal Dangers of Media Consolidation|publisher=Democracy Now|date=25 January 2007|access-date=November 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206055034/http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/25/exclusive_911_calls_in_north_dakota|archive-date=December 6, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe ammonia spill was the largest of its kind in the United States, with one person killed, and over 1,000 seeking medical attention. Clear Channel claimed no responsibility for its failure to warn residents, maintaining that the city should have used the [[Emergency Alert System]] to trigger automatic equipment in place at all U.S. radio stations. The EAS equipment was later found to be functional at the time, but had not been activated by city, state or regional authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/2718|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201021200/http://www.radioworld.com/article/2718|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-01|title=Reconsidering Minot and EAS|access-date=2010-10-12|publisher=NewBay Media}}</ref> Unfortunately, other critical systems throughout Minot were either inoperable or had failed, including the public siren system, electricity in parts of the town, and the 9-1-1 telephone system, which became overloaded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2157395/|title=The whole story about that toxic spill and the Clear Channel \"monopoly.\"|author=Jack Shafer|date=10 January 2007|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=September 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125002557/http://www.slate.com/id/2157395/|archive-date=November 25, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe incident has been cited as an example of the physical dangers of media consolidation and the prevalent cost-cutting measure of eliminating overnight staff at stations.{{who|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Rejection of advertising images===\n[[File:PrideBoards.gif|thumb|left|Clear Channel Outdoor rejected the two images on the left]]\nIn June 2010 Clear Channel Outdoor rejected without comment two [[digital billboard]] images submitted by St. Pete Pride, an [[LGBT]] organization that sponsors [[gay pride]] events in the [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] area, leading the group to cancel its contract with Clear Channel. St. Pete Pride has stated that throughout its eight-year history, Clear Channel has edited the organization's advertising material, and questioned whether the rejection of these images were because they displayed same-sex couples in affectionate poses. A Clear Channel spokesperson declined to comment on the specific reasons why the images were rejected but denied that the affection being shown was an issue, saying that such images had been included in previous St. Pete Pride campaigns.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pransky |first=Noah |title=St. Pete Pride gay-themed digital billboards rejected by Clear Channel Outdoor |location=St. Petersburg, Florida |publisher=WTSP |date=2010-06-11 |url=http://www.wtsp.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=133980&catid=8 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref>\n\n===Censorship===\niHeartMedia and its subsidiaries have been associated with censorship of state and federal candidates for public office, elected officials and various political viewpoints.\n\niHeartMedia has been criticized for censoring opinions critical of [[George W.

[[Magic (Bruce Springsteen album)|Magic]], the 2007 release from [[Bruce Springsteen]] which contained songs that were subtly critical of [[George W. Bush]] and his administration, was censored from air play on Clear Channel. Despite that, Springsteen's album still sold very well. After [[Natalie Maines]], the singer of the country band [[Dixie Chicks]], told a London audience that they were \"ashamed [of the fact that] the president of the United States is from Texas\", the band's radio airplay dropped precipitously. Afterwards, some iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel) stations removed The Dixie Chicks from their playlists without any noted repercussions from the company. Gail Austin, Clear Channel's director of programming said, \"Out of respect for our troops, our city and our listeners, [we] have taken the Dixie Chicks off our playlists.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2003/03/17/daily14.html |first=Michael |last=Fitzgerald |title=Dixie Chicks axed by Clear Channel |date=2003-03-18 |access-date=October 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010015435/http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2003/03/17/daily14.html |archive-date=October 10, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Clear Channel was accused of orchestrating the radio blacklist by such critics as Paul Krugman; however, others claim some Clear Channel stations continued to play the band longer than some other companies.<ref>Gabriel Rossman, \"Elites, Masses, and Media Blacklists: The Dixie Chicks Controversy\", ''Social Forces'': 83 (2004): 61\u201378.</ref>\n\nClear Channel-owned [[KTVX]] was the only local television station that refused to air the paid political message of [[Cindy Sheehan]] against the war in [[Iraq]].<ref>{{Cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=TV station refuses to air anti-war ad days before Bush visit |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-20-bush-ad_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2005-08-20 |access-date=2007-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180633/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-20-bush-ad_x.htm |archive-date=July 16, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn May 8, 2014, the FCC was asked to respond to a political programming complaint, made against an iHeartMedia owned broadcast licensee, Capstar TX LLC by supporters of [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]], the Democratic candidate for Governor of Wisconsin.

The custom caller service provided by Premiere Radio assures its clients they won't hear the same actor's voice for at least two months in order to appear authentic to listeners who might otherwise catch on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/life-and-religion/58759/radio-daze/|title=Radio Daze|work=Tablet Magazine|access-date=February 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216081007/http://www.tabletmag.com/life-and-religion/58759/radio-daze/|archive-date=February 16, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===iHeartMedia and rock radio===\niHeartMedia has caused controversy with rock music fans in major cities for changing the programming on several longtime rock stations to other formats.
