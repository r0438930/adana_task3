He flew [[Aichi D3A]] dive bomber from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the [[Indian Ocean Raid]], and later from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']] in both carrier battles during [[Solomon Islands Campaign]], where he scored bomb hits on [[United States Navy]] (USN) carrier ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]'' on two separate occasions.\n\n==Early career==\nKiyoto Furuta was born in 1914 in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] to a poor farmer family with five children. In his youth he often worked hard on the field to help his father. In order to escape the hard farming life, he volunteered for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in 1931. He went through the training at [[Kure]] naval base and eventually became a mechanic. He aspired to become a pilot and passed a pre-test for naval pilot training. However, he was initially rejected during the physical exam due to the problem with his eardrum. The problem was eventual resolved after six months and he was then accepted for the naval pilot training program at [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near [[Tokyo]]. He graduated from 32nd class in 1936 and specialized in dive bombing.\n\nIn 1937, Furuta was first assigned to the 12th Air Group to fight in [[Central China]] before he was transferred to the newest carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]''. He was eventually promoted to [[Petty Officer]]. He wanted to leave the navy in order to pursue civil aviation career, however Japan was about to enter the war with United States and needed all available pilots. In October 1941, he was transferred to ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]'' in preparation for the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].\n\n==Pacific War==\nDuring the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Petty Officer Furuta flew as pilot ''Akagi's'' dive bomber squadron leader ([[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]), [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Takehiko Chihaya. Since the US carriers, which were their intended targets, were not present at the time of the attack, they hit the battleships instead. The element of surprise was long gone by the time the second wave arrived, leading them to face intense anti-aircraft fire. After releasing the bomb, Furuta's aircraft was hit in the left fuel tank and started leaking. He barely managed to return to ''Akagi'' before his fuel ran out.\n\nIn February 1942, Furuta took part in [[Bombing of Darwin]]. In April, he participated in the [[Indian Ocean Raid]], where he was part of the strike against the British carrier ''[[HMS Hermes (95)|Hermes]]''. By the time the ''Akagi'' pilots' turn arrived, the leading strike formation, under [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Kakuichi Takahashi]], had already effectively sunk ''Hermes'' with numerous bomb hits. Therefore, they attacked the Australian destroyer [[HMAS Vampire (D68)|''Vampire'']] instead, sinking her within ten minutes.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942, Furuta was part of the strike force against the USN airfield and installations on [[Midway Atoll]]. On the way to the atoll, they were intercepted by a large group of Midway-based [[United States Marines|Marine]] fighters (six [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s and 20 [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]]s) led by Major [[Floyd B. Parks]]. In the ensuing air battle, four [[Nakajima B5N]] bombers and one [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter were shot down by the Americans. In return, two F4Fs and 13 F2As were shot down, while most of the remaining were damaged beyond airworthiness. Furuta and his group of dive bombers hit the Midway airfield and headed back to IJN fleet. Upon returning, he witnessed the unsuccessful attack on IJN carriers by the Midway-based Marine [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers. After the attack was over, he landed on ''Akagi'', which was preparing to launch a strike against USN carrier detected in the North-East. However, before the preparation could be finished, ''Akagi'' was hit and set ablaze by a bomb dropped by Lieutenant [[Richard Halsey Best|Dick Best]] during the USN dive bomber attack. Furuta and the rest of the crew were given order to abandon the ship and were evacuated.\n\nIn July 1942, Petty Officer Furuta was transferred to [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']]. He severed as a pilot of dive bomber division leader ([[buntaich\u014d]]) Lieutenant [[Keiichi Arima]]. In late August 1942, ''Sh\u014dkaku'' participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]. During the attack on USN carriers, Furuta was part of the first strike wave that consisted of 27 D3A dive bombers and 10 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]] fighters, under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Mamoru Seki]] (hik\u014dtaich\u014d). Arima led one of the three divisions (ch\u016btai), with nine dive bombers under his command. Rgw USN Combat Air Patrol (CAP) of [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters intercepted the formation of dive bombers, but Furuta and Arima's division managed to escape into [[cumulonimbus]] clouds and approached the US carrier ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]'' unharmed. Furuta made a dive-bombing attack on ''Enterprise'' and released his 250 kilogram [[Armor-piercing shell|semi-AP]] bomb around an altitude of 500 meters. The bomb, the first ever to hit ''Enterprise'', penetrated the starboard forward corner of her number 3 elevator aft and sliced through to the third deck before detonating inside the ship. After the attack, Lieutenant Arima instructed Furuta to remain north-west of the burning ''Enterprise'' to wait for the friendly Zero fighters in order to led them back to the Japanese carriers. However, several USN fighters spotted their aircraft and started to pursue them. Furuta evaded the attackers by flying very close to the sea surface and eventually made it back to IJN fleet after sunset. In the dark, he barely found ''Sh\u014dkaku'' before his fuel ran out.\n\nIn late October 1942, ''Sh\u014dkaku'' was again dispatched to Solomon Islands to support the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] ground assault on [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. During the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], Furuta was again the pilot of Lieutenant Arima, whose division was part of Lieutenant Commander Seki's second strike wave that consisted of 27 D3A dive bombers and 5 A6M Zero fighters. Arima's division again attacked ''Enterprise''. Furuta approached the carrier from astern and released the bomb at an altitude of between 450 and 500 meters and scored a hit. The 250 kilogram semi-AP bomb penetrated the center of the flight deck, around six meters from the forward edge, and detonated inside the carrier causing fires. They did not encounter any CAP on the way out and Arima instructed Furuta to climb to 6000 meters, where he could estimate the damage they had caused on ''Enterprise''. Since a simultaneous USN strike damaged the flight deck of ''Sh\u014dkaku'', Furuta was forced to land on ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]]'' upon return to the IJN fleet.\n\n==Later career==\nAfter the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, Petty Officer Furuta was transferred to [[Usa, \u014cita|Usa]] NAS in [[\u014cita Prefecture]] on Kyushu and served as an instructor (together with his observer Lieutenant Arima). He was eventually promoted to [[Lieutenant Junior Grade|Lieutenant (jg)]] and was considered for a promotion to full Lieutenant. However, he refused the promotion as he wanted to retire from the navy to pursue his initial goal to become a civil aviation pilot. He survived the war but like many other former officers had a trouble finding a job, since former officers were not allowed to hold public jobs in the post-war period according to the policy dictated by the Allies. He eventually settled on farming. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n* {{cite interview\n |interviewer=\n |title=NHK\u6226\u4e89\u8a3c\u8a00: \u53e4\u7530\u6e05\u4eba\n |language=Japanese\n |year=2009\n |url=https://www2.nhk.or.jp/archives/shogenarchives/shogen/movie.cgi?das_id=D0001130142_00000\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = \u6c5f\u9593 | first = \u4fdd\n | year = 1991\n | title = \u6025\u964d\u4e0b\u7206\u6483\u968a\u2015\u65e5\u672c\u6d77\u8ecd\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30c0\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\n | language = Japanese\n | publisher = \u4eca\u65e5\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u793e\n | isbn = 4875651384\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Lundstrom\n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=The First Team: Pacific Naval Air Combat from Pearl Harbor to Midway \n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-471-X\n}}\n* {{cite book \n |last=Lundstrom \n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 \n |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign: Naval Fighter Combat from August to November 1942\n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-472-8}}\n* {{cite interview\n|interviewer=Joel Shepherd and Kan Sugahara\n|title=Accounts - Keiichi Arima\n|url=http://www.cv6.org/company/accounts/arima/\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Tagaya\n | first = Osamu\n | year = 2011\n | title = Aichi 99 Kanbaku 'Val' Units\n | publisher = Osprey Publishing\n | location =\n | series = Combat Aircraft #63\n | isbn = 1841769126\n }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Furuta, Kiyoto}}\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Possibly living people]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox military person\n|name= Kiyoto Furuta\n|birth_date=1914\n|death_date=\n|birth_place=[[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Lieutenant Junior Grade|Lieutenant (jg)]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12th Air Group<br/>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]''<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']]<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]<br/>[[Bombing of Darwin]]<br/>[[Indian Ocean Raid]]<br/>[[Battle of Midway]]<br/>[[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]<br/>[[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Furuta}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Kiyoto Furuta'''|\u53e4\u7530 \u6e05\u4eba|Furuta Kiyoto|}} was a [[dive bomber]] pilot in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].
