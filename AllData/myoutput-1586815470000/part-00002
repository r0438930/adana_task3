The album was released after the rapper's success with his [[LL Cool J]] [[diss (music)|diss track]], \"[[Second Round K.O.]]\", which was included on ''Can-I-Bus'', with additional support from heavyweight boxer [[Mike Tyson]].\n\nHowever, the album received mixed reviews. The beats, created mostly by [[Wyclef Jean]], were criticized for their blandness and unoriginality (with a fair amount of the criticism coming from Canibus), but lyrically, the album was praised. Tower Records referred to Canibus as \"one of the most innovative new MCs in hip-hop. With ''Can-I-Bus'', the debut album, Canibus delivers more of the battle-rhyme lyrics that are his stock in trade. Still, he manages to cover new ground with conceptually strong cuts like 'I Honor U,' which is dedicated to his mother. With his lyrical skills, Canibus represents the elements that helped build rap music.\" The album was [[gold certification|certified gold]] by the [[RIAA]]. The song \"How We Roll\" also appeared on the bonus 3rd disc of Eightball's album ''[[Lost (Eightball album)|Lost]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/can-i-bus-mw0000672286|title=Can-I-Bus - Canibus|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref>\n| rev2      = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev2Score = B<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,63711,00.html|title=Can-I-Bus|last=Browne|first=David|authorlink=David Browne (journalist)|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=September 14, 1998|accessdate=March 2, 2008}}</ref>\n| rev3      = MVRemix\n| rev3Score = 7/10<ref name=\"MVR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mvremix.com/urban/reviews/1998/canibus.shtml|title=Canibus - ''Can-I-Bus''|last=Lunny|first=Hugo|website=MVRemix|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}</ref>\n| rev4      = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev4Score = 8/10<ref>NME.
