It has a long association with London's [[LGBT]] scene and is home to long-running gay night [[G-A-Y]]. The club is also well known for [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s [[acid house]] events in the 1980s, the underground festival in a nightclub  [[Megatripolis]], and for being the birthplace of [[ambient house]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nHeaven was opened in December 1979 by [[Jeremy Norman]] in a former, run-down roller-disco called Global Village, which was housed in the arches beneath Charing Cross railway station, once part of Adelphi Arches, a large wine-cellar for the hotel above. Norman was also chairman of [[Burke's Peerage]], the publishers. The original hi-tech interior was designed by his partner, Derek Frost. Norman, an entrepreneur, had started an earlier club, The Embassy, in Old Bond Street in 1978. The Embassy proved to be very successful and attracted a fashionable clientele; it is generally seen as the London equivalent of New York's [[Studio 54]]. Norman used his knowledge and experience of establishing and running a nightclub to create an entirely new kind of gay club on a larger scale. Heaven quickly established itself as the centre of the (then understated) gay London nightlife. Until it opened, most gay clubs were small hidden cellar-bars or pub discos. Heaven brought gay clubbing into the UK mainstream and gave London a club to rival [[New York City|New Yorks]] gay super club at the time, [[Saint (nightclub)|The Saint]].\n\nHeaven's first resident DJ was [[Ian Levine]], who has often been credited with being one of the first DJ's in the UK of the now customary style of \"[[beatmixing]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Bill|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey|date=2014|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802146106|page=212}}</ref> His mix of [[Disco]], [[Hi-NRG]], and early [[House music]] became what is known as the ''Original Heaven Sound''.\n\nUnder the direction of the club's original manager David Inches, Heaven sought DJs who would become exclusive to the club and were groundbreaking in terms of their music selection and style. Many Heaven DJs would go on to find greater acclaim in both the gay and mainstream music industry.
