Gulshan is now a mix of a serene residential area and also a city centre with shopping malls and commercial buildings. The Gulshan city centre only consists of Gulshan, Baridhara and Banani.

Apart from the urban areas, the 37 mouzas of Gulshan Thana also contain 20 villages.\n\nGulshan is a commercial and residential area, originally meant for offices and embassies of diplomatic missions, as well as residences.<ref name=Imran/> The area has seen an upsurge, since the mid-1990s, in the number of high-rise buildings, restaurants, residential areas, modern markets and ice-cream parlors which are open past midnight. The independent houses of the early 1970s that stood far from each other in Gulshan area have vanished because of the commercial boom, to the point of old residents claiming it is not a residential area anymore.\n\n[[File:Gulshan Avenue, Dhaka (27766703491).jpg|thumb|Gulshan Avenue]]\nThough Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara, as well as Uttara and other satellite towns like Bashundhara are relatively on higher lands, substantial part the Gulshan Thana area remained underwater for a prolonged duration during the [[1998 Bangladesh floods]].
