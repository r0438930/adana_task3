The warmest months of the year include January and February, with average temperatures between {{convert|7.8|and|8.2|C}}.

Port-aux-Fran\u00e7ais receives a modest amount of precipitation ({{convert|708|mm|abbr=on}} per year) compared to the west coast which receives an estimated three times as much precipitation per year.\n\nThe mountains are frequently covered in snow but can thaw very quickly in rain. Over the course of several decades, many permanent glaciers have shown signs of retreat, with some smaller ones having disappeared completely.\n\nThe west coast receives almost continuous wind at an average speed of {{convert|35|km/h|abbr=on}} because the islands are between the [[Roaring Forties]] and the Furious Fifties.
