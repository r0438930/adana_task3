The issue that declared Giuliani the Person of the Year included an article that mentioned ''Time's'' earlier decision to select the Ayatollah Khomeini and the 1999 rejection of Hitler as \"Person of the Century\". The article seemed to imply that Osama bin Laden ''was'' a stronger candidate than Giuliani, as Adolf Hitler was a stronger candidate than Albert Einstein. The selections were ultimately based on what the magazine describes as who they believed had a stronger influence on history and who represented either the year or the century the most. According to ''Time'', Rudolph Giuliani was selected for symbolizing the American response to the September 11th attacks, and Albert Einstein selected for representing a century of scientific exploration and wonder.\n\nAnother controversial choice was the 2006 selection of \"[[You (Time Person of the Year)|You]]\", representing most if not all people for advancing the [[information age]] by using the [[Internet]] (via e.g. [[blogs]], [[MySpace]], [[YouTube]], and [[Wikipedia]]).<ref name=\"you\">{{cite news | author=Lev Grossman | title=You \u2013 Yes, You \u2013 Are Time's Person of the Year | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570810,00.html | work=Time | date=December 13, 2006 | accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawn selections ===\n\nIn 1941, the fictional elephant [[Dumbo]] from the Disney movie of the same name was selected to be \"Mammal of the Year\", and a cover was created showing Dumbo in a formal portrait style.

The U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt was named Man of the Year for a record third time, although Dumbo's Mammal of the Year profile still appeared on the inside pages of the magazine.<ref name=\"WDFM\" />\n\nFilm-maker [[Michael Moore]] claims that director [[Mel Gibson]] cost him the opportunity to be Person of the Year alongside Gibson in 2004. Moore's controversial political documentary ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' became the highest-grossing documentary of all time the same year Gibson's ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' became a box-office success and also caused significant controversy. Moore said in an interview \"I got a call right after the '04 election from an editor from ''Time'' Magazine. He said,' ''Time'' Magazine has picked you and Mel Gibson to be ''Time''{{'}}s Person of the Year to put on the cover, Right and Left, Mel and Mike.

The idea was also an attempt to remedy the editorial embarrassment earlier that year of not having aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] on its cover following his historic [[trans-Atlantic flight]]. By the end of the year, it was decided that a cover story featuring Lindbergh as the Man of the Year would serve both purposes.<ref>''Time'' (2002), ''Person of the Year: 75th Anniversary Celebration'', p. 1.</ref>\n\n== Selection ==\n\n=== U.S. presidents ===\nSince the list began, every serving [[president of the United States]] has been a Man or Person of the Year at least once with the exceptions of [[Calvin Coolidge]] (in office at time of the first issue), [[Herbert Hoover]] (the subsequent U.S. president), and [[Gerald Ford]]. Most were named Man or Person of the Year either the year they were elected or while they were in office; the only one to be given the title before being elected is [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], in 1944 as Supreme Commander of the Allied Invasion Force, eight years before his election. He subsequently received the title again in 1959, while in office. Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only person to have received the title three times, first as president-elect (1932) and later as the incumbent president (1934 and 1941).\n\n=== Women ===\nPrior to 1999, four women were granted the title as individuals: three as \"Woman of the Year\"\u2014[[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] (1936), [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] (1952), and [[Corazon Aquino]] (1986)\u2014and one as half of the \"Man and Wife of the Year\", [[Soong Mei-ling]] (1937).<ref name=\"Soong\">{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019712_2019710_2019671,00.html |title=Mme Chiang Kai-Shek: 1937 |author=Joan Levenstein |access-date=December 7, 2016 |work=Time}}</ref> \"American Women\" were recognized as a group in 1975. Other classes of people recognized comprise both men and women, such as \"[[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Freedom Fighters]]\" (1956), \"U.S. Scientists\" (1960), \"[[Baby boomer|The Inheritors]]\" (1966), \"[[Middle class|The Middle Americans]]\" (1969), \"The American Soldier\" (2003), \"[[You (Time Person of the Year)|You]]\" (2006), \"The Protester\" (2011) represented on the cover by a woman, and \"[[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|Ebola fighters]]\" (2014). Although the title on the magazine remained \"Man of The Year\" for both the 1956 \"Hungarian Freedom Fighter\" and the 1966 \"Twenty-five and Under\" editions which both featured a woman standing behind a man, and \"Men of the Year\" on the 1960 \"U.S. Scientists\" edition which exclusively featured men on its cover. It was not until the 1969 edition on \"The Middle Americans\" did the title embrace \"Man and Woman of the Year\".\n\nIn 1999, the title was changed to Person of the Year.<ref>The first [http://www.time.com/time/coverspoy/ \"Person\" of the Year] (rather than \"Man / Woman \" of the Year) was [[Jeff Bezos]] of [[Amazon.com]].</ref> Women who have been selected for recognition after the renaming include \"The Whistleblowers\" ([[Cynthia Cooper (accountant)|Cynthia Cooper]], [[Coleen Rowley]], and [[Sherron Watkins]] in 2002), [[Melinda Gates]] (jointly with [[Bill Gates]] and [[Bono]], in 2005), [[Angela Merkel]] in 2015, \"The Silence Breakers\" in 2017 and [[Greta Thunberg]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/greta-thunberg-time-s-2019-person-year-n1099396 |title=Greta Thunberg is Time's 2019 Person of the Year|first=Safia Samee |last=Ali |first2=Elizabeth |last2=Chuck |work=[[nbcnews.com]] |date=11 December 2019 |access-date=11 December 2019 |publisher=[[NBC Universal]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/ |title=Greta Thunberg: Time's Person of the Year 2019 |first=Charlotte |last=Alter |first2=Suyin |last2=Haynes |first3=Justin |last3=Worland |editor-first=Evgenia |editor-last=Arbugaeva |date=11 December 2019 |access-date=11 December 2019 |magazine=Time}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, to celebrate [[International Women's Day]], TIME editors released 89 new Time covers, each showing women, in addition to the 11 already chosen, for alternate Person of the Year choices for the past century.<ref>https://time.com/100-women-of-the-year/</ref>\n\n=== Groups and non-humans ===\nDespite the name, the title is not just granted to individuals.

The issue that declared Giuliani the Person of the Year included an article that mentioned ''Time's'' earlier decision to select the Ayatollah Khomeini and the 1999 rejection of Hitler as \"Person of the Century\". The article seemed to imply that Osama bin Laden ''was'' a stronger candidate than Giuliani, as Adolf Hitler was a stronger candidate than Albert Einstein. The selections were ultimately based on what the magazine describes as who they believed had a stronger influence on history and who represented either the year or the century the most. According to ''Time'', Rudolph Giuliani was selected for symbolizing the American response to the September 11th attacks, and Albert Einstein selected for representing a century of scientific exploration and wonder.\n\nAnother controversial choice was the 2006 selection of \"[[You (Time Person of the Year)|You]]\", representing most if not all people for advancing the [[information age]] by using the [[Internet]] (via e.g. [[blogs]], [[MySpace]], [[YouTube]], and [[Wikipedia]]).<ref name=\"you\">{{cite news | author=Lev Grossman | title=You \u2013 Yes, You \u2013 Are Time's Person of the Year | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570810,00.html | work=Time | date=December 13, 2006 | accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawn selections ===\n\nIn 1941, the fictional elephant [[Dumbo]] from the Disney movie of the same name was selected to be \"Mammal of the Year\", and a cover was created showing Dumbo in a formal portrait style. However, the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7 pre-empted the cover. The U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt was named Man of the Year for a record third time, although Dumbo's Mammal of the Year profile still appeared on the inside pages of the magazine.<ref name=\"WDFM\" />\n\nFilm-maker [[Michael Moore]] claims that director [[Mel Gibson]] cost him the opportunity to be Person of the Year alongside Gibson in 2004. Moore's controversial political documentary ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' became the highest-grossing documentary of all time the same year Gibson's ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' became a box-office success and also caused significant controversy. Moore said in an interview \"I got a call right after the '04 election from an editor from ''Time'' Magazine. He said,' ''Time'' Magazine has picked you and Mel Gibson to be ''Time''{{'}}s Person of the Year to put on the cover, Right and Left, Mel and Mike. The only thing you have to do is pose for a picture with each other. And do an interview together.' I said 'OK.' They call Mel up, he agrees. They set the date and time in LA. I'm to fly there.
