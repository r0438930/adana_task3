{"title_page": "Carlo II Malatesta", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=April 2020}}\n\n'''Carlo II Malatesta''' ({{Circa|1390}} \u2013 14 November 1438) was an Italian politician and [[condottiero]]. He was lord of [[Pesaro]], [[Gradara]], [[Senigallia]], [[Fossombrone]] and [[Civitanova Marche]]. He was the son of [[Malatesta IV Malatesta]] and [[Elisabetta da Varano]].\n\n==Life==\nIn 1409 he followed his father to [[Florence]] to fight against the [[King of Naples]]'s army. In 1421 he fought for the [[Papal States]] against [[Perugia]] and for a short time for the Florentines against [[Milan]]. He and his brother [[Galeazzo Malatesta|Galeazzo]] were captured at [[Gradara]] in 1424 after their father's and their cousin Carlo's defeat at [[Zagonara]] by the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]]. Carlo joined the Visconti army and in 1426 fought in [[Romagna]] against the Anti-Visconti League.\n\nIn 1427 he was made captain general of the Visconti armies, putting him in command of 1,200 cavalry in the battle against [[Francesco Bussone]]. The Visconti force was defeated at [[Pizzighettone]] and Carlo was captured again until being freed when the two sides made peace. In 1428 Carlo married [[Colonna family|Vittoria Colonna]], [[Pope Martin V]]'s niece, but the couple remained childless. In 1430 he fought against [[Rimini]] but was defeated and fled from [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]. Shortly afterwards he defended [[Bologna]] against an attack by [[Anton Galeazzo Bentivoglio]].\n\nIn 1431 a revolt broke out in [[Pesaro]], forcing Carlo to retreat to [[Fossombrone]] then to Gradara and elsewhere. In 1433 he helped the Montefeltro and the Visconti reconquer their own lands. The resulting treaty brought peace between the Papal States and the two Malatesta brothers, Carlo and Galeazzo. Carlo returned to Pesaro on 24 September and killed all those who had revolted two years earlier.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*E. Angiolini and A.
