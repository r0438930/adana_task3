In the case of a [[leap second]], the value of ss may extend to 60. A leading zero is added for numbers under 10, but it is optional for the hours. The leading zero is very commonly used in computer applications, and always used when a specification requires it (for example, [[ISO 8601]]).\n\nWhere subsecond resolution is required, the seconds can be a [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]; that is, the fractional part follows a decimal dot or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], which is also the symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the [[Full stop|dot on the line]] as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, \"2359\".\n\n=== Midnight 00:00 and 24:00 ===\nIn the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date<ref>[[ISO 8601]]:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'', clause 4.2.3 Midnight</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.\n\nThe notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. \"00:00\u201324:00\", \"07:00\u201324:00\"). Similarly, some bus and train timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.\n\nWhile the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. [[Style guide]]s and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead.<ref name=acp121>\"[http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf Communication instructions \u2013 General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807210103/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf |date=2011-08-07}}\", Allied Communications Publication ACP 121(I), page 3\u20136, Combined Communications-Electronics Board, October 2010<!-- IF THIS LINK GOES DEAD, see http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ for the latest version of ACP 121 --></ref> Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided.<ref name=acp121 /> In variance with this, the correspondence manual for the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] formerly specified 0001 to 2400.<ref name=\"http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Portals/116/Docs/G-1/AAU/AAUDocuments/CORRESPONDENCE%20MANUAL.pdf\">SECNAV M-5216.5 Department of the Navy Correspondence Manual dated March 2010, Chapter 2, Section 5 Paragraph 15.

However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling.\n\n=== Computer support ===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of [[12-hour clock#Computer support|specific language and region settings]]. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. [[POSIX]] programs such as [[ls]] default to displaying timestamps in 24-hour format.\n\n=== Military time ===\nIn [[American English]], the term ''military time'' is a synonym for the 24-hour clock.<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|military time}}</ref> In these dialects, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' distinguishing the two [[Day|diurnal]] repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the [[12-hour clock#Confusion at noon and midnight|ambiguities of the 12-hour notation]] are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.\n\nMilitary usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces,<ref>{{Cite web\n| title=Communication Instructions General ACP 121(I)\n| url=http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508202743/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archivedate=2016-05-08\n}}</ref> differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:\n*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example \"0340Z\").\n*[[Leading zero]]s are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43&nbsp;a.m. is spoken \"zero five forty-three\" (casually) or \"zero five four three\" (military radio), as opposed to \"five forty-three\" or \"five four three\".\n*[[List of military time zones|Military time zones]] are lettered and given word designations from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. For example, in [[Eastern Time Zone|US Eastern Standard Time]] (UTC\u22125), which is designated time zone R, 6:00&nbsp;a.m. is written \"0600R\" and spoken \"zero six hundred Romeo\".\n*Local time is designated as zone J or \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Juliett]]\". \"1200J\" (\"twelve hundred Juliett\") is noon local time.\n*[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is designated time zone Z, and thus called \"Zulu time\". (When used as a modern time zone, in practice, GMT and UTC coincide. For other purposes there may be a difference of about a second.<ref>{{Cite journal| ref = harv | last1 = Guinot| first1 = Bernard | date = August 2011 | volume=48 | issue=4 | title = Solar time, legal time, time in use | journal = Metrologia | page =185| doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/48/4/S08|bibcode = 2011Metro..48S.181G}}</ref>)\n*Hours are always \"hundred\", never \"thousand\"; 1000 is \"ten hundred\" not \"one thousand\"; 2000 is \"twenty hundred\" not \"two thousand\".\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Florence-Duomo-Clock.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paolo Uccello]]'s ''Face with Four Prophets/Evangelists'' (1443) in the [[Florence Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Clock 24 J.jpg|thumb|The 24 hour tower clock in [[Venice]] that lists hours 1 to 12 twice]]\nThe 24-hour time system has its origins in the Egyptian astronomical system of [[decan]]s, and has been used for centuries by scientists, astronomers, navigators, and [[Horology|horologists]].

In the past, some European countries used the [[Full stop|dot on the line]] as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, \"2359\".\n\n=== Midnight 00:00 and 24:00 ===\nIn the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date<ref>[[ISO 8601]]:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'', clause 4.2.3 Midnight</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.\n\nThe notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. \"00:00\u201324:00\", \"07:00\u201324:00\"). Similarly, some bus and train timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.\n\nWhile the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. [[Style guide]]s and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead.<ref name=acp121>\"[http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf Communication instructions \u2013 General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807210103/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf |date=2011-08-07}}\", Allied Communications Publication ACP 121(I), page 3\u20136, Combined Communications-Electronics Board, October 2010<!-- IF THIS LINK GOES DEAD, see http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ for the latest version of ACP 121 --></ref> Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided.<ref name=acp121 /> In variance with this, the correspondence manual for the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] formerly specified 0001 to 2400.<ref name=\"http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Portals/116/Docs/G-1/AAU/AAUDocuments/CORRESPONDENCE%20MANUAL.pdf\">SECNAV M-5216.5 Department of the Navy Correspondence Manual dated March 2010, Chapter 2, Section 5 Paragraph 15.

However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling.\n\n=== Computer support ===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of [[12-hour clock#Computer support|specific language and region settings]]. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. [[POSIX]] programs such as [[ls]] default to displaying timestamps in 24-hour format.\n\n=== Military time ===\nIn [[American English]], the term ''military time'' is a synonym for the 24-hour clock.<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|military time}}</ref> In these dialects, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' distinguishing the two [[Day|diurnal]] repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the [[12-hour clock#Confusion at noon and midnight|ambiguities of the 12-hour notation]] are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.\n\nMilitary usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces,<ref>{{Cite web\n| title=Communication Instructions General ACP 121(I)\n| url=http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508202743/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archivedate=2016-05-08\n}}</ref> differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:\n*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example \"0340Z\").\n*[[Leading zero]]s are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43&nbsp;a.m. is spoken \"zero five forty-three\" (casually) or \"zero five four three\" (military radio), as opposed to \"five forty-three\" or \"five four three\".\n*[[List of military time zones|Military time zones]] are lettered and given word designations from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. For example, in [[Eastern Time Zone|US Eastern Standard Time]] (UTC\u22125), which is designated time zone R, 6:00&nbsp;a.m. is written \"0600R\" and spoken \"zero six hundred Romeo\".\n*Local time is designated as zone J or \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Juliett]]\". \"1200J\" (\"twelve hundred Juliett\") is noon local time.\n*[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is designated time zone Z, and thus called \"Zulu time\". (When used as a modern time zone, in practice, GMT and UTC coincide.
