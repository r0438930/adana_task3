On the night of July 13, 1942 at 22:00, the liquidation of the ghetto was carried out when a \"shared\" division of the [[SS]] and Ukrainian police units surrounded the ghetto, positioned spotlights around it and turned them on. Brigade SS and Ukrainian police were divided into small groups, broke into houses and pushed the people out, herded them into a freight train which took them to [[Kostopol]] (or [[Prokhorovsky District|Prokhurov]]) where they were shot to death in small Aktionen.<ref name=\"Burds\" /> 5000 Jews were killed in this manner.<ref name=\"Altman\">{{cite journal|last=Altman|first=Nolan|date=January 2010|title=R\u00f3wne (Rovno) Victims Killed in the Kostopol Forest|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/Holocaust/0217_Rovno_victims.html|publisher=JewishGen.org.

The two men who were appointed to head the Judenrat were Moses and Jacob Bergman (Leon) Suharchuk. They both committed suicide at the end of 1941 because they did not want to follow the Nazis' demand to turn over a group of Jews.<ref name=\"Megargee\" /> The Jews living in the ghetto had to pay levies to the German authorities . In one operation to seize the money, the Jews were required to pay the German authorities the exact sum of 12 million Rubles. Also, the German authorities confiscated any gold, jewelry, furniture and clothing which remained in the Jews' possession. At the time of the operation, the Jews were selling clothes in order to get some food. The most valuable items were sent to Germany, the rest of them were given to German soldiers and Ukrainian policemen or they were sold to them for symbolic prices. In the ghetto numerous restrictions were imposed on the Jews, including the obligation to wear a distinctive sign.\n\n== Resistance ==\nUnderground organizations operated in the ghetto and accumulated weapons. \n\n150 Jews were saved by an engineer working for the local [[Deutsche Reichsbahn|Reichsbahn]], [[Hermann Friedrich Graebe|Hermann Graebe,]] as the ghetto was being liquidated.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://ww2today.com/13th-july-1942-horror-of-the-liquidation-of-the-rovno-ghetto|title=Horror of the 'liquidation' of the Rovno ghetto|author=World War II today|year=2017|work=From the evidence of Hermann Graebe, during \u201cThe [[Einsatzgruppen Case]]\u201d, Nuremburg, 1947|quote=Around 23,000 people were murdered shortly after the German invasion in June 1941.
