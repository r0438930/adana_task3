Classical Chinese is a traditional style of [[written Chinese]] that evolved from the classical language, making it different from any modern [[Chinese spoken language|spoken form of Chinese]]. Literary Chinese was used for almost all formal writing in [[China]] until the early 20th century, and also, during various periods, in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]. Among Chinese speakers, Literary Chinese has been largely replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], a style of writing that is similar to modern spoken [[Mandarin Chinese]], while speakers of non-Chinese languages have largely abandoned Literary Chinese in favor of local vernaculars.\n\nLiterary Chinese is known as ''{{lang|ja-Latn|[[kanbun]]}}'' ({{lang|ja|\u6f22\u6587}}) in Japanese, ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[hanmun]]}}'' in Korean (but see also ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[gugyeol]]}}'') and ''{{lang|vi|c\u1ed5 v\u0103n}}'' ({{lang|vi-Hani|\u53e4\u6587}})<ref name=\"Nguy\u1ec5n Tri T\u00e0i 2002 p5\">{{cite book |last=Nguy\u1ec5n |first=Tri T\u00e0i |date=2002 |title=Gi\u00e1o tr\u00ecnh ti\u1ebfng H\u00e1n.

It is often also referred to as \"Classical Chinese\", but [[Sinology|sinologists]] generally distinguish it from the language of the early period. During this period the dialects of China became more and more disparate and thus the Classical written language became less and less representative of the [[varieties of Chinese]] (cf. [[Classical Latin]], which was contemporary to the Han Dynasty, and the [[Romance languages]] of Europe). Although authors sought to write in the style of the Classics, the similarity decreased over the centuries due to their imperfect understanding of the older language, the influence of their own speech, and the addition of new words.<ref>Norman (1988), pp. 83\u201384, 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nThis situation, the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|use of Literary Chinese throughout the Chinese cultural sphere]] despite the existence of disparate regional vernaculars, is called [[diglossia]].  It can be compared to the position of [[Classical Arabic]] relative to the various [[Varieties of Arabic|regional vernaculars]] in Arab lands, or of [[Latin]] in medieval Europe. The Romance languages continued to evolve, influencing Latin texts of the same period, so that by the [[Middle Ages]], [[Medieval Latin]] included many usages that would have baffled the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The coexistence of Classical Chinese and the native languages of Japan, Korea and Vietnam can be compared to the use of Latin in nations that natively speak non-Latin-derived [[Germanic languages]] or [[Slavic languages]], to the position of Arabic in [[Persia]] or the position of the Indic language, [[Sanskrit]], in South India and Southeast Asia. However, the non-phonetic [[Chinese characters|Chinese writing system]] causes a unique situation where the modern pronunciation of the classical language is far more divergent (and heterogeneous, depending on the native \u2013 not necessarily Chinese \u2013 tongue of the reader) than in analogous cases, complicating understanding and study of Classical Chinese further compared to other classical languages.\n\nChristian missionaries coined the term Wen-li ({{zh|t=\u6587\u7406|p=w\u00e9nl\u01d0|w=wen-li}}) for Literary Chinese.\nThough composed from Chinese roots, this term was never used in that sense in Chinese,<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Aspects of Chinese sociolinguistics: essays by Yuen Ren Chao\n | author-link = Chao Yuen Ren\n | last = Chao | first = Yuen Ren\n | publisher = Stanford University Press\n | year = 1976\n | isbn = 978-0-8047-0909-5\n | page = 25\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ky6sAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25\n }}</ref>\nand was rejected by non-missionary sinologues.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=_mdFT8LWHYL10gG74I3qAw&id=dsF7AAAAMAAJ&dq=2+The+invitation+to+the+conference+still+called+for+a+standard+classic+version+%28+DuBose+in+Chinese+Recorder+1877%2C+533%29.+1+The+term+%22Wenli%22+%28%27%24CW%29+was+%22an+English+word+derived+from+Chinese+roots+but+never+used+by+the+Chinese%22+%28Yuen+1976%2C&q=term+derived+roots\n|title=The Bible in China: the history of the Union Version or the culmination of protestant missionary Bible translation in China\n|year=1999\n|author=Jost Oliver Zetzsche\n|publisher=Monumenta Serica Institute\n|isbn=3-8050-0433-8\n|quote=The term \"Wenli\" (\u6587\u7406) was \"an English word derived from Chinese roots but never used by the Chinese\" (Yuen 1976, 25).

For sinologues outside the missionary circle, the term \"wenli\" was not acceptable (\"... what the missionaries persist in calling wen li, meaning thereby the book language as opposed to the colloquial\"\u2014 Giles 1881/82, 151).\n|page=161\n}}</ref>\n\n== Pronunciation ==\n{{Further information|Old Chinese phonology|Middle Chinese}}\n[[Image:Old chinese.PNG|right|thumb|The shape of the [[Oracle bone script]] character for \"person\" may have influenced that for \"harvest\" (which later came to mean \"year\").  Today, they are pronounced ''r\u00e9n'' and ''ni\u00e1n'' in Mandarin, but their hypothesized pronunciations in [[Old Chinese]] were very similar, which may explain the resemblance.  For example, in the recent [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese#Baxter\u2013Sagart (2014)|Baxter-Sagart reconstruction]]<ref>http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/</ref>, they were {{IPA|/ni\u014b/}} and {{IPA|/n\u02e4i\u014b/}}, respectively, becoming {{IPA|/n\u02b2in/}} and {{IPA|/nin/}} in [[Early Middle Chinese]].]]\n[[Chinese character]]s are not [[alphabet|alphabetic]] and only rarely reflect [[sound changes]].  The tentative reconstruction of [[Old Chinese]] is an endeavor only a few centuries old. As a result, Classical Chinese is not read with a reconstruction of Old Chinese pronunciation; instead, it is always read with the pronunciations of characters categorized and listed in the Phonology Dictionary (\u97fb\u66f8; [[pinyin]]: ''y\u00f9nsh\u016b'', \"[[Rime dictionary|rhyme book]]\") officially published by the Governments, originally based upon the Middle Chinese pronunciation of [[Luoyang]] in the 2nd to 4th centuries.  With the progress of time, every dynasty has updated and modified the official Phonology Dictionary.  By the time of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and [[Ming Dynasty]], the Phonology Dictionary was based on early Mandarin.  But since the [[Imperial Examination]] required the composition of [[Shi (poetry)|Shi]] genre, in non-Mandarin speaking parts of China such as [[Zhejiang]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], pronunciation is either based on everyday speech as in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]; or, in some varieties of Chinese (e.g. [[Southern Min]]), with a special set of pronunciations used for Classical Chinese or \"formal\" vocabulary and usage borrowed from Classical Chinese usage.  In practice, all varieties of Chinese combine these two extremes. Mandarin and Cantonese, for example, also have words that are pronounced one way in colloquial usage and another way when used in Classical Chinese or in specialized terms coming from Classical Chinese, though the system is not as extensive as that of Southern Min or [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. (See [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]])\n\n[[Japanese language|Japanese]],  [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] readers of Classical Chinese use systems of pronunciation specific to their own languages. For example, Japanese speakers use ''On'yomi'' pronunciation when reading the [[kanji]] of words of Chinese origin such as \u9280\u884c (gink\u014d) or the name for the city of T\u014dky\u014d (\u6771\u4eac), but use ''Kun'yomi'' when the kanji represents a native word such as the reading of \u884c in \u884c\u304f (iku) or the reading of both characters in the name for the city of \u014csaka (\u5927\u962a), and a system that aids Japanese speakers with Classical Chinese word order.\n\nSince the pronunciation of all modern varieties of Chinese is different from Old Chinese or other forms of historical Chinese (such as [[Middle Chinese]]), characters that once [[rhyme]]d in poetry may not rhyme any longer, or vice versa. Poetry and other rhyme-based writing thus becomes less coherent than the original reading must have been. However, some modern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] have certain phonological characteristics that are closer to the older pronunciations than others, as shown by the preservation of certain rhyme structures. Some{{who|date=October 2019}} believe Classical Chinese literature, especially poetry, sounds better when read in certain varieties that are believed to be closer to older pronunciations, such as Cantonese or Southern Min, because the rhyming is often lost due to sound shifts in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].\n\nAnother phenomenon that is common in reading Classical Chinese is [[homophone|homophony]] (words that sound the same). More than 2,500 years of sound change separates Classical Chinese from any modern variety, so when reading Classical Chinese in any modern variety of Chinese (especially Mandarin) or in Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, many characters which originally had different pronunciations have become [[homonym]]s. There is a famous Classical Chinese poem written in the early 20th century by the linguist [[Chao Yuen Ren]] called the ''[[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]]'', which contains only words that are now pronounced {{IPA-cmn|\u0282\u0268|}} with various tones in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. It was written to show how Classical Chinese has become an impractical language for speakers of modern Chinese because Classical Chinese when spoken aloud is largely incomprehensible. However the poem is perfectly comprehensible when read silently because Literary Chinese, by its very nature as a ''written'' language using a [[logographic]] writing system, can often get away with using homophones that even in spoken Old Chinese would not have been distinguishable in any way.\n\nThe situation is analogous to that of some English words that are spelled differently but sound the same, such as \"meet\" and \"meat\", which were pronounced {{IPA-enm|me\u02d0t|}} and {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0t]}} respectively during the time of [[Chaucer]], as shown by their spelling. However, such homophones are far more common in Literary Chinese than in English. For example, the following distinct Old Chinese words are now all pronounced ''y\u00ec'' in Mandarin: ''*\u014bjajs'' \u8b70 \"discuss\", ''*\u014bj\u0259t'' \u4ee1 \"powerful\", ''*\u0294jup'' \u9091 \"city\", ''*\u0294j\u0259k'' \u5104 \"100,000,000\", ''*\u0294j\u0259ks'' \u610f \"thought\", ''*\u0294jek'' \u76ca \"increase\", ''*\u0294jik'' \u6291 \"press down\", ''*jak'' \u5f08 \"Chinese chess\", ''*ljit'' \u9038 \"flee\", ''*lj\u0259k'' \u7ffc \"wing\", ''*ljek'' \u6613 \"change\", ''*ljeks'' \u6613 \"easy\" and ''*slek'' \u8734 \"lizard\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology\n  | first = William H. | last = Baxter | authorlink = William H.

An essay in Classical Chinese, for example, might use half as many [[Chinese character]]s as in vernacular Chinese to relate the same content.\n\nIn terms of conciseness and compactness, Classical Chinese rarely uses words composed of two Chinese characters; nearly all words are of one [[syllable]] only. This stands directly in contrast with modern Northern Chinese varieties including Mandarin, in which two-syllable, three-syllable, and four-syllable words are extremely common, whilst although two-syllable words are also quite common within modern Southern Chinese varieties, they are still more archaic in that they use more one-syllable words than Northern Chinese varieties. This phenomenon exists, in part, because polysyllabic words evolved in Chinese to disambiguate homophones that result from sound changes. This is similar to such phenomena in English as the [[pin\u2013pen merger|''pen\u2013pin'' merger]] of many dialects in the American south and the [[Cot\u2013caught merger|''caught-cot'' merger]] of most dialects of American English: because the words \"pin\" and \"pen\", as well as \"caught\" and \"cot\", sound alike in such dialects of English, a certain degree of confusion can occur unless one adds qualifiers like \"ink pen\" and \"stick pin.\" Similarly, Chinese has acquired many polysyllabic words in order to disambiguate monosyllabic words that sounded different in earlier forms of Chinese but identical in one region or another during later periods. Because Classical Chinese is based on the literary examples of ancient Chinese literature, it has almost none of the two-syllable words present in modern Chinese varieties.\n\nClassical Chinese has more [[pronoun]]s compared to the modern vernacular. In particular, whereas Mandarin has one general character to refer to the first-person pronoun (\"I\"/\"me\"), Literary Chinese has several, many of which are used as part of [[honorific]] language (see [[Chinese honorifics]]).\n\nIn [[syntax]], Classical Chinese is always ready to drop subjects and objects when a reference to them is understood ([[Pro-drop language|pragmatically inferable]]). Also, words are not restrictively categorized into [[parts of speech]]: nouns are commonly used as verbs, adjectives as nouns, and so on. There is no [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] in Classical Chinese, \"\u662f\" ([[pinyin]]: ''sh\u00ec'') is a copula in modern Chinese but in old Chinese it was originally a near [[demonstrative]] (\"this\"); the modern Chinese for \"this\" is \"\u9019\" ([[pinyin]]: ''zh\u00e8'').\n\nBeyond grammar and vocabulary differences, Classical Chinese can be distinguished by literary and cultural differences: an effort to maintain [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and rhythm, even in prose works, and extensive use of literary and cultural allusions, thereby also contributing to brevity.\n\nMany final particles (\u6b47\u8a9e\u5b57 ''xi\u0113y\u01d4z\u00ec'') and interrogative particles are found in Literary Chinese.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGFkAAAAMAAJ&q=wen+li+styl+particularly+so+called+abounds\n|title=Introduction to Literary Chinese\n|year=1936\n|author=J.

Classical Chinese was used to write the [[Hunmin Jeongeum]] proclamation in which the modern Korean alphabet ([[hangul]]) was promulgated and the essay by [[Hu Shih]] in which he argued against using Classical Chinese and in favor of [[written vernacular Chinese]].  (The latter parallels [[De vulgari eloquentia|the essay]] written by [[Dante]] in ''Latin'' in which he expounded the virtues of the vernacular ''Italian''.)  Exceptions to the use of Classical Chinese were vernacular novels such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.\n\nMost government documents in the [[Republic of China]] were written in Classical Chinese until reforms in the 1970s, in a reform movement spearheaded by President [[Yen Chia-kan]] to shift the written style to [[vernacular Chinese]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Feng-fu|last=Tsao|chapter=The language planning situation in Taiwan|pages=60\u2013106|editor1-last=Baldauf|editor1-first=Richard B.|editor2-first=Robert B.|editor2-last=Kaplan|title=Language planning in Nepal, Taiwan, and Sweden|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2000|volume=115|isbn=978-1-85359-483-0}} pages 75\u201376.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cheong|first=Ching|title=Will Taiwan break away: the rise of Taiwanese nationalism|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001|pages=187|isbn=978-981-02-4486-6}}</ref>\n\nToday, pure Classical Chinese is occasionally used in formal or ceremonial occasions. The ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]'' (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u570b\u6b4c), for example, is in Classical Chinese. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts, or [[sutra]]s, are still preserved in Classical Chinese from the time they were composed or translated from [[Sanskrit]] sources.  In practice there is a socially accepted continuum between vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese. For example, most official notices and formal letters are written with a number of stock Classical Chinese expressions (e.g. salutation, closing). Personal letters, on the other hand, are mostly written in vernacular, but with some Classical phrases, depending on the subject matter, the writer's level of education, etc. With the exception of professional scholars and enthusiasts, most people today cannot write in full Classical Chinese with ease.\n\nMost Chinese people with at least a middle school education are able to read basic Classical Chinese, because the ability to read (but not write) Classical Chinese is part of the Chinese [[middle school]] and [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] [[curricula]] and is part of the college entrance examination. Classical Chinese is taught primarily by presenting a classical Chinese work and including a vernacular gloss that explains the meaning of phrases. Tests on classical Chinese usually ask the student to express the meaning of a paragraph in vernacular Chinese. They often take the form of comprehension questions.\n\nThe contemporary use of Classical Chinese in [[Japan]] is mainly in the field of education and the study of literature. Learning the Japanese way ([[kanbun]]) of decoding Classical Chinese is part of the [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] curriculum in Japan.<ref>{{cite book| title =\u4e2d\u5b66\u6821 \u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u6821 \u5b66\u7fd2\u6307\u5c0e\u8981\u9818 \u56fd\u8a9e\u79d1\u7de8\uff08\u8a66\u6848\uff09| chapter =\u7b2c\u4e03\u7ae0 \u56fd\u8a9e\u79d1\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u6f22\u6587\u306e\u5b66\u7fd2\u6307\u5c0e| url =http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| year =1951| author =\u6587\u90e8\u7701| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091215230001/http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| archivedate =2009-12-15}}</ref>\n\nClassical Chinese is not a part of middle school and high school [[curricula]] in the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Vietnam]] nowadays.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The use of Classical Chinese in these regions is limited and is mainly in the field of [[Chinese classics|Classical studies]].\n\nIn addition, many works of [[literature]] in Classical Chinese (such as [[Tang poetry]]) have been major [[cultural]] influences.

Classical Chinese is a traditional style of [[written Chinese]] that evolved from the classical language, making it different from any modern [[Chinese spoken language|spoken form of Chinese]]. Literary Chinese was used for almost all formal writing in [[China]] until the early 20th century, and also, during various periods, in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]. Among Chinese speakers, Literary Chinese has been largely replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], a style of writing that is similar to modern spoken [[Mandarin Chinese]], while speakers of non-Chinese languages have largely abandoned Literary Chinese in favor of local vernaculars.\n\nLiterary Chinese is known as ''{{lang|ja-Latn|[[kanbun]]}}'' ({{lang|ja|\u6f22\u6587}}) in Japanese, ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[hanmun]]}}'' in Korean (but see also ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[gugyeol]]}}'') and ''{{lang|vi|c\u1ed5 v\u0103n}}'' ({{lang|vi-Hani|\u53e4\u6587}})<ref name=\"Nguy\u1ec5n Tri T\u00e0i 2002 p5\">{{cite book |last=Nguy\u1ec5n |first=Tri T\u00e0i |date=2002 |title=Gi\u00e1o tr\u00ecnh ti\u1ebfng H\u00e1n.

It is often also referred to as \"Classical Chinese\", but [[Sinology|sinologists]] generally distinguish it from the language of the early period. During this period the dialects of China became more and more disparate and thus the Classical written language became less and less representative of the [[varieties of Chinese]] (cf. [[Classical Latin]], which was contemporary to the Han Dynasty, and the [[Romance languages]] of Europe). Although authors sought to write in the style of the Classics, the similarity decreased over the centuries due to their imperfect understanding of the older language, the influence of their own speech, and the addition of new words.<ref>Norman (1988), pp. 83\u201384, 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nThis situation, the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|use of Literary Chinese throughout the Chinese cultural sphere]] despite the existence of disparate regional vernaculars, is called [[diglossia]].  It can be compared to the position of [[Classical Arabic]] relative to the various [[Varieties of Arabic|regional vernaculars]] in Arab lands, or of [[Latin]] in medieval Europe. The Romance languages continued to evolve, influencing Latin texts of the same period, so that by the [[Middle Ages]], [[Medieval Latin]] included many usages that would have baffled the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The coexistence of Classical Chinese and the native languages of Japan, Korea and Vietnam can be compared to the use of Latin in nations that natively speak non-Latin-derived [[Germanic languages]] or [[Slavic languages]], to the position of Arabic in [[Persia]] or the position of the Indic language, [[Sanskrit]], in South India and Southeast Asia. However, the non-phonetic [[Chinese characters|Chinese writing system]] causes a unique situation where the modern pronunciation of the classical language is far more divergent (and heterogeneous, depending on the native \u2013 not necessarily Chinese \u2013 tongue of the reader) than in analogous cases, complicating understanding and study of Classical Chinese further compared to other classical languages.\n\nChristian missionaries coined the term Wen-li ({{zh|t=\u6587\u7406|p=w\u00e9nl\u01d0|w=wen-li}}) for Literary Chinese.\nThough composed from Chinese roots, this term was never used in that sense in Chinese,<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Aspects of Chinese sociolinguistics: essays by Yuen Ren Chao\n | author-link = Chao Yuen Ren\n | last = Chao | first = Yuen Ren\n | publisher = Stanford University Press\n | year = 1976\n | isbn = 978-0-8047-0909-5\n | page = 25\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ky6sAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25\n }}</ref>\nand was rejected by non-missionary sinologues.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=_mdFT8LWHYL10gG74I3qAw&id=dsF7AAAAMAAJ&dq=2+The+invitation+to+the+conference+still+called+for+a+standard+classic+version+%28+DuBose+in+Chinese+Recorder+1877%2C+533%29.+1+The+term+%22Wenli%22+%28%27%24CW%29+was+%22an+English+word+derived+from+Chinese+roots+but+never+used+by+the+Chinese%22+%28Yuen+1976%2C&q=term+derived+roots\n|title=The Bible in China: the history of the Union Version or the culmination of protestant missionary Bible translation in China\n|year=1999\n|author=Jost Oliver Zetzsche\n|publisher=Monumenta Serica Institute\n|isbn=3-8050-0433-8\n|quote=The term \"Wenli\" (\u6587\u7406) was \"an English word derived from Chinese roots but never used by the Chinese\" (Yuen 1976, 25). The original meaning is \"principles of literature (or: writing),\" but by the missionaries of the last century it was coined to stand for classical Chinese. For sinologues outside the missionary circle, the term \"wenli\" was not acceptable (\"... what the missionaries persist in calling wen li, meaning thereby the book language as opposed to the colloquial\"\u2014 Giles 1881/82, 151).\n|page=161\n}}</ref>\n\n== Pronunciation ==\n{{Further information|Old Chinese phonology|Middle Chinese}}\n[[Image:Old chinese.PNG|right|thumb|The shape of the [[Oracle bone script]] character for \"person\" may have influenced that for \"harvest\" (which later came to mean \"year\").  Today, they are pronounced ''r\u00e9n'' and ''ni\u00e1n'' in Mandarin, but their hypothesized pronunciations in [[Old Chinese]] were very similar, which may explain the resemblance.  For example, in the recent [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese#Baxter\u2013Sagart (2014)|Baxter-Sagart reconstruction]]<ref>http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/</ref>, they were {{IPA|/ni\u014b/}} and {{IPA|/n\u02e4i\u014b/}}, respectively, becoming {{IPA|/n\u02b2in/}} and {{IPA|/nin/}} in [[Early Middle Chinese]].]]\n[[Chinese character]]s are not [[alphabet|alphabetic]] and only rarely reflect [[sound changes]].  The tentative reconstruction of [[Old Chinese]] is an endeavor only a few centuries old. As a result, Classical Chinese is not read with a reconstruction of Old Chinese pronunciation; instead, it is always read with the pronunciations of characters categorized and listed in the Phonology Dictionary (\u97fb\u66f8; [[pinyin]]: ''y\u00f9nsh\u016b'', \"[[Rime dictionary|rhyme book]]\") officially published by the Governments, originally based upon the Middle Chinese pronunciation of [[Luoyang]] in the 2nd to 4th centuries.  With the progress of time, every dynasty has updated and modified the official Phonology Dictionary.  By the time of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and [[Ming Dynasty]], the Phonology Dictionary was based on early Mandarin.  But since the [[Imperial Examination]] required the composition of [[Shi (poetry)|Shi]] genre, in non-Mandarin speaking parts of China such as [[Zhejiang]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], pronunciation is either based on everyday speech as in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]; or, in some varieties of Chinese (e.g. [[Southern Min]]), with a special set of pronunciations used for Classical Chinese or \"formal\" vocabulary and usage borrowed from Classical Chinese usage.  In practice, all varieties of Chinese combine these two extremes. Mandarin and Cantonese, for example, also have words that are pronounced one way in colloquial usage and another way when used in Classical Chinese or in specialized terms coming from Classical Chinese, though the system is not as extensive as that of Southern Min or [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. (See [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]])\n\n[[Japanese language|Japanese]],  [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] readers of Classical Chinese use systems of pronunciation specific to their own languages. For example, Japanese speakers use ''On'yomi'' pronunciation when reading the [[kanji]] of words of Chinese origin such as \u9280\u884c (gink\u014d) or the name for the city of T\u014dky\u014d (\u6771\u4eac), but use ''Kun'yomi'' when the kanji represents a native word such as the reading of \u884c in \u884c\u304f (iku) or the reading of both characters in the name for the city of \u014csaka (\u5927\u962a), and a system that aids Japanese speakers with Classical Chinese word order.\n\nSince the pronunciation of all modern varieties of Chinese is different from Old Chinese or other forms of historical Chinese (such as [[Middle Chinese]]), characters that once [[rhyme]]d in poetry may not rhyme any longer, or vice versa. Poetry and other rhyme-based writing thus becomes less coherent than the original reading must have been. However, some modern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] have certain phonological characteristics that are closer to the older pronunciations than others, as shown by the preservation of certain rhyme structures. Some{{who|date=October 2019}} believe Classical Chinese literature, especially poetry, sounds better when read in certain varieties that are believed to be closer to older pronunciations, such as Cantonese or Southern Min, because the rhyming is often lost due to sound shifts in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].\n\nAnother phenomenon that is common in reading Classical Chinese is [[homophone|homophony]] (words that sound the same). More than 2,500 years of sound change separates Classical Chinese from any modern variety, so when reading Classical Chinese in any modern variety of Chinese (especially Mandarin) or in Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, many characters which originally had different pronunciations have become [[homonym]]s. There is a famous Classical Chinese poem written in the early 20th century by the linguist [[Chao Yuen Ren]] called the ''[[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]]'', which contains only words that are now pronounced {{IPA-cmn|\u0282\u0268|}} with various tones in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. It was written to show how Classical Chinese has become an impractical language for speakers of modern Chinese because Classical Chinese when spoken aloud is largely incomprehensible. However the poem is perfectly comprehensible when read silently because Literary Chinese, by its very nature as a ''written'' language using a [[logographic]] writing system, can often get away with using homophones that even in spoken Old Chinese would not have been distinguishable in any way.\n\nThe situation is analogous to that of some English words that are spelled differently but sound the same, such as \"meet\" and \"meat\", which were pronounced {{IPA-enm|me\u02d0t|}} and {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0t]}} respectively during the time of [[Chaucer]], as shown by their spelling. However, such homophones are far more common in Literary Chinese than in English. For example, the following distinct Old Chinese words are now all pronounced ''y\u00ec'' in Mandarin: ''*\u014bjajs'' \u8b70 \"discuss\", ''*\u014bj\u0259t'' \u4ee1 \"powerful\", ''*\u0294jup'' \u9091 \"city\", ''*\u0294j\u0259k'' \u5104 \"100,000,000\", ''*\u0294j\u0259ks'' \u610f \"thought\", ''*\u0294jek'' \u76ca \"increase\", ''*\u0294jik'' \u6291 \"press down\", ''*jak'' \u5f08 \"Chinese chess\", ''*ljit'' \u9038 \"flee\", ''*lj\u0259k'' \u7ffc \"wing\", ''*ljek'' \u6613 \"change\", ''*ljeks'' \u6613 \"easy\" and ''*slek'' \u8734 \"lizard\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology\n  | first = William H. | last = Baxter | authorlink = William H.

An essay in Classical Chinese, for example, might use half as many [[Chinese character]]s as in vernacular Chinese to relate the same content.\n\nIn terms of conciseness and compactness, Classical Chinese rarely uses words composed of two Chinese characters; nearly all words are of one [[syllable]] only. This stands directly in contrast with modern Northern Chinese varieties including Mandarin, in which two-syllable, three-syllable, and four-syllable words are extremely common, whilst although two-syllable words are also quite common within modern Southern Chinese varieties, they are still more archaic in that they use more one-syllable words than Northern Chinese varieties. This phenomenon exists, in part, because polysyllabic words evolved in Chinese to disambiguate homophones that result from sound changes. This is similar to such phenomena in English as the [[pin\u2013pen merger|''pen\u2013pin'' merger]] of many dialects in the American south and the [[Cot\u2013caught merger|''caught-cot'' merger]] of most dialects of American English: because the words \"pin\" and \"pen\", as well as \"caught\" and \"cot\", sound alike in such dialects of English, a certain degree of confusion can occur unless one adds qualifiers like \"ink pen\" and \"stick pin.\" Similarly, Chinese has acquired many polysyllabic words in order to disambiguate monosyllabic words that sounded different in earlier forms of Chinese but identical in one region or another during later periods. Because Classical Chinese is based on the literary examples of ancient Chinese literature, it has almost none of the two-syllable words present in modern Chinese varieties.\n\nClassical Chinese has more [[pronoun]]s compared to the modern vernacular. In particular, whereas Mandarin has one general character to refer to the first-person pronoun (\"I\"/\"me\"), Literary Chinese has several, many of which are used as part of [[honorific]] language (see [[Chinese honorifics]]).\n\nIn [[syntax]], Classical Chinese is always ready to drop subjects and objects when a reference to them is understood ([[Pro-drop language|pragmatically inferable]]). Also, words are not restrictively categorized into [[parts of speech]]: nouns are commonly used as verbs, adjectives as nouns, and so on. There is no [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] in Classical Chinese, \"\u662f\" ([[pinyin]]: ''sh\u00ec'') is a copula in modern Chinese but in old Chinese it was originally a near [[demonstrative]] (\"this\"); the modern Chinese for \"this\" is \"\u9019\" ([[pinyin]]: ''zh\u00e8'').\n\nBeyond grammar and vocabulary differences, Classical Chinese can be distinguished by literary and cultural differences: an effort to maintain [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and rhythm, even in prose works, and extensive use of literary and cultural allusions, thereby also contributing to brevity.\n\nMany final particles (\u6b47\u8a9e\u5b57 ''xi\u0113y\u01d4z\u00ec'') and interrogative particles are found in Literary Chinese.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGFkAAAAMAAJ&q=wen+li+styl+particularly+so+called+abounds\n|title=Introduction to Literary Chinese\n|year=1936\n|author=J.

Classical Chinese was used to write the [[Hunmin Jeongeum]] proclamation in which the modern Korean alphabet ([[hangul]]) was promulgated and the essay by [[Hu Shih]] in which he argued against using Classical Chinese and in favor of [[written vernacular Chinese]].  (The latter parallels [[De vulgari eloquentia|the essay]] written by [[Dante]] in ''Latin'' in which he expounded the virtues of the vernacular ''Italian''.)  Exceptions to the use of Classical Chinese were vernacular novels such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.\n\nMost government documents in the [[Republic of China]] were written in Classical Chinese until reforms in the 1970s, in a reform movement spearheaded by President [[Yen Chia-kan]] to shift the written style to [[vernacular Chinese]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Feng-fu|last=Tsao|chapter=The language planning situation in Taiwan|pages=60\u2013106|editor1-last=Baldauf|editor1-first=Richard B.|editor2-first=Robert B.|editor2-last=Kaplan|title=Language planning in Nepal, Taiwan, and Sweden|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2000|volume=115|isbn=978-1-85359-483-0}} pages 75\u201376.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cheong|first=Ching|title=Will Taiwan break away: the rise of Taiwanese nationalism|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001|pages=187|isbn=978-981-02-4486-6}}</ref>\n\nToday, pure Classical Chinese is occasionally used in formal or ceremonial occasions. The ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]'' (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u570b\u6b4c), for example, is in Classical Chinese. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts, or [[sutra]]s, are still preserved in Classical Chinese from the time they were composed or translated from [[Sanskrit]] sources.  In practice there is a socially accepted continuum between vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese. For example, most official notices and formal letters are written with a number of stock Classical Chinese expressions (e.g. salutation, closing). Personal letters, on the other hand, are mostly written in vernacular, but with some Classical phrases, depending on the subject matter, the writer's level of education, etc. With the exception of professional scholars and enthusiasts, most people today cannot write in full Classical Chinese with ease.\n\nMost Chinese people with at least a middle school education are able to read basic Classical Chinese, because the ability to read (but not write) Classical Chinese is part of the Chinese [[middle school]] and [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] [[curricula]] and is part of the college entrance examination. Classical Chinese is taught primarily by presenting a classical Chinese work and including a vernacular gloss that explains the meaning of phrases. Tests on classical Chinese usually ask the student to express the meaning of a paragraph in vernacular Chinese, using multiple choice. They often take the form of comprehension questions.\n\nThe contemporary use of Classical Chinese in [[Japan]] is mainly in the field of education and the study of literature. Learning the Japanese way ([[kanbun]]) of decoding Classical Chinese is part of the [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] curriculum in Japan.<ref>{{cite book| title =\u4e2d\u5b66\u6821 \u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u6821 \u5b66\u7fd2\u6307\u5c0e\u8981\u9818 \u56fd\u8a9e\u79d1\u7de8\uff08\u8a66\u6848\uff09| chapter =\u7b2c\u4e03\u7ae0 \u56fd\u8a9e\u79d1\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u6f22\u6587\u306e\u5b66\u7fd2\u6307\u5c0e| url =http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| year =1951| author =\u6587\u90e8\u7701| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091215230001/http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| archivedate =2009-12-15}}</ref>\n\nClassical Chinese is not a part of middle school and high school [[curricula]] in the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Vietnam]] nowadays.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The use of Classical Chinese in these regions is limited and is mainly in the field of [[Chinese classics|Classical studies]].\n\nIn addition, many works of [[literature]] in Classical Chinese (such as [[Tang poetry]]) have been major [[cultural]] influences.
