King Jaipal then sent a new message to the Sultan and his Amir, stating \"You have seen the impetuosity of the Hindus and their indifference to death. If you insist on war in the hope of obtaining plunder, tribute, elephants and slaves, then you leave us no alternative but to destroy our property, take the eyes out of our elephants, cast our families in fire, and commit mass suicide, so that all that will be left to you to conquer and seize is stones and dirt, dead bodies, and scattered bones.\"<ref name= Sabuktigin >Al-Utbi, [[Tarikh Yamini]], For English translation, see: Elliot and Dowson, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians - The Muhammadan Period, Vol 2, Trubner London, pp. 18\u201324</ref> Amir Sabuktigin then promised peace in exchange for a large ransom. King Jaipal, after receiving this peace offer, assumed that peace is likely and ordered his army to withdraw from a confrontation.

The aftermath of the [[Partition of India]] in 1947 to create a separate Islamic state of Pakistan for Muslims, saw large scale [[sectarian strife]] and bloodshed throughout the nation. Since then, India has witnessed sporadic large-scale violence sparked by underlying tensions between sections of the Hindu and Muslim communities. These conflicts also stem from the ideologies of hardline right-wing groups versus [[Islamic Fundamentalists]] and prevalent in certain sections of the population. Since independence, [[India]] has always maintained a [[Indian constitution|constitutional]] commitment to [[secularism]]. The major incidences include the [[1969 Gujarat riots]], [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], the [[1989 Bhagalpur riots]], [[Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus|1989 Kashmir violence]], [[Godhra train burning]],  [[2002 Gujarat riots]] and [[2013 Muzaffarnagar riots]].\n\n===Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus===\n{{main|Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus}}\nIn the [[Violence in Kashmir|Kashmir]] region, approximately 300 [[Kashmiri Pandits]] were killed between September 1989 to 1990 in various incidents.<ref name=\"Pandits\"/> In early 1990, local Urdu newspapers ''Aftab'' and ''Al Safa'' called upon Kashmiris to wage [[jihad]] against India and ordered the expulsion of all Hindus choosing to remain in Kashmir.<ref name=\"Pandits\"/> In the following days masked men ran in the streets with [[AK-47]] shooting to kill Hindus who would not leave.<ref name=\"Pandits\"/> Notices were placed on the houses of all Hindus, telling them to leave within 24 hours or die.<ref name=\"Pandits\"/>\n\nSince March 1990, estimates of between 300,000 and 500,000 pandits have migrated outside Kashmir<ref>[http://news.oneindia.in/2009/05/04/kashmirspandits-accuse-election-commission-ofdiscriminati.html Kashmir's Pandits accuse Election Commission of discrimination against them] OneIndia \u2013 4 May 2009</ref> due to persecution by [[Islamic fundamentalists]] in the largest case of ethnic cleansing since the partition of India.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=131481 | title = Kashmiri Pandits in Nandimarg decide to leave Valley | publisher = [[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]] | date = 30 March 2003 |accessdate = 30 November 2007}}</ref> The proportion of Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir valley has declined from about 15% in 1947 to, by some estimates, less than 0.1% since the insurgency in Kashmir took on a religious and sectarian flavour.<ref>Kashmir: The scarred and the beautiful.
