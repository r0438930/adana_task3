After the Allies successfully held beachheads following [[D-Day]], two prefabricated harbours were taken in sections across the [[English Channel]] from UK with the invading army and assembled off [[Omaha Beach]] (Mulberry \"A\") and [[Gold Beach]] (Mulberry \"B\").\n\nThe Mulberry harbours were to be used until major French ports could be captured and brought back into use after repair of the inevitable sabotage by German defenders. The Mulberry B harbour at [[Gold Beach]] was used for 10 months after D-Day, and over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies were landed before it was fully decommissioned. The still only partially-completed Mulberry A harbour at [[Omaha Beach]] was damaged on 19 June by a violent storm that suddenly arrived from the north-east. After three days the storm finally abated and damage was found to be so severe that the harbour had to be abandoned.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Dieppe Raid]] of 1942 had shown that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] could not rely on being able to penetrate the [[Atlantic Wall]] to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed [[Draft (hull)|sufficient depth of water]] under their [[keel]]s, together with [[Crane (machine)|dockside cranes]], to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain [[Operation Overlord]]. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], [[pier]]s and roadways.\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Construction of Mulberry Harbours, Southampton, April 1944 A25792.jpg|thumb|[[Phoenix breakwater|Phoenix caissons]] under construction, Southampton 1944]]\nWith the planning of [[Operation Overlord]] at an advanced stage by the summer of 1943, it was accepted that the proposed artificial harbours would need to be prefabricated in the UK and then towed across the English Channel.\n\nThe need for two separate artificial harbours \u2013 one American and one British/Canadian \u2013 was agreed at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. An Artificial Harbours Sub-Committee was set up under the Chairmanship of the civil engineer Colin R White (Sir Bruce White's brother) to advise on the location of the harbour and the form of the breakwater; the Sub-Committee's first meeting was held at the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) on 4 August 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf|title=War Office: Artificial Harbours|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> The minutes of the Sub-Committee's meetings show that initially it was envisaged that bubble breakwaters would be used, then block ships were proposed and finally, due to an insufficient number of block ships being available, a mix of block ships and purpose made concrete caisson units.\n\nOn 2 September 1943 the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] estimated that the artificial ports (Mulberries) would need to handle 12,000 tons per day, exclusive of motor transport and in all weathers. On 4 September the go ahead was given to start work immediately on the harbours. However, infighting between the [[War Office]] and the [[Admiralty]] over responsibility was only resolved on 15 December 1943 by the intervention of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff. The decision was that the Admiralty managed the blockships, Bombardons and assembly of all constituent parts on the south coast of England. Further the Admiralty would undertake all necessary work to survey, site, tow and mark navigation.\n\nThe War Office was given the task of constructing the concrete caissons (Phoenixes), the roadways (Whales) and protection via anti-aircraft installations. Once at the site, the army was responsible for sinking the caissons and assembling all the various other units of the harbours.\n\nFor the Mulberry A at Omaha Beach, the naval Corps of Civil Engineers would construct the harbour from the prefabricated parts.\n\nThe proposed harbours called for many huge [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] of various sorts to build breakwaters and piers and connecting structures to provide the roadways. The caissons were built at a number of locations, mainly existing ship building facilities or large beaches, like Conwy Morfa, around the British coast. The works were let out to commercial construction firms including [[Wates Group|Wates Construction]] [[Balfour Beatty]], [[Henry Boot PLC|Henry Boot]], [[Lend Lease Project Management & Construction|Bovis & Co]], [[Cochrane Shipbuilders|Cochrane & Sons]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[Holland, Hannen & Cubitts|Cubitts]], [[W. & C. French|French]], [[Holloway Brothers (London)|Holloway Brothers]], [[John Laing Group|John Laing & Son]], [[Peter Lind & Company]], [[Sir Robert McAlpine]], [[Melville Dundas|Melville Dundas & Whitson]], [[Mowlem]], [[BAM Nuttall|Nuttall]], [[Sir Lindsay Parkinson|Parkinson]], [[Halcrow Group]], [[Pauling & Co.]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]].{{sfn|Hartcup|2011|p=94}} On completion they were towed across the English Channel by [[Tugboat|tugs]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Thames Tugs |url=http://www.thamestugs.co.uk/BRITISH-TUGS.php |title=Mulberry Harbour: British, French and Dutch tugs' |access-date=20 April 2009}}</ref> to the Normandy coast at only {{convert|4.3|kn|km/h|order=flip}}, assembled, operated and maintained by the [[Royal Engineers|Corps of Royal Engineers]], under the guidance of Reginald D. Gwyther, who was appointed CBE for his efforts. Various elements of the \"Whale\" piers were designed and constructed by a group of companies led by Braithwaite & Co, West Bromwich and Newport.\n\n===Beach surveys===\nBoth locations for the temporary harbours required detailed information concerning [[geology]], [[hydrography]] and sea conditions. To collect this data a special team of hydrographers was created in October 1943. The 712th Survey Flotilla, operated from [[Stone frigate|naval base]] [[List of Royal Navy shore establishments#S to Z|HMS ''Tormentor'']] in [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]], were detailed to collect soundings off the enemy coast. Between November 1943 and January 1944 this team used a [[LCPL|Landing Craft Personnel (Large)]], or LCP(L), to survey the Normandy coast.\n\nThe special LCP(L) was manned by a Royal Navy crew and a small group of hydrographers. The first sortie, Operation KJF, occurred on the night of 26/27 November 1943 when three LCP(L)s took measurements off the port of Arromanches, the location for Mulberry B. A follow up mission, Operation KJG, to the proposed location for Mulberry A happened on 1/2 December but a navigation failure meant the team sounded an area 2,250 yards west of the correct area.\n\nTwo attempts had to be made to take soundings off the [[Ver-sur-Mer|Point de Ver]]. The first sortie, Operation Bellpush Able, on 25/26 December had issues with their equipment and returned on 28/29 December to complete the task.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1943, a [[Combined Operations Headquarters#Operations|Combined Operations Pilotage Party]] (COPP), left Gosport for the Gold Beach area at [[Luc-sur-Mer]]. Two soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]], Major Scott-Bowden and [[Sergeant#Royal Marines and British Army|Sergeant]] Ogden-Smith, were landed on the beach at night in [[Operation Postage Able]] and took samples of the sand. These were crucial in determining whether the armoured vehicles would be able to operate on the beach or become bogged down. The final survey, Operation Bellpush Charlie, occurred on the night of 30\u201331 January but limited information was gathered due to fog and because German lookouts heard the craft. Further sorties were abandoned.{{sfn|Falconer|2013|pp=69\u201371}}\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:MulberryB - Piers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Aerial view of Mulberry harbour \"B\" at [[Arromanches]] (October 27, 1944)]]\nAn early idea for temporary harbours was sketched by [[Winston Churchill]] in a 1915 memo to [[Lloyd George]]. This memo was for artificial harbours to be created off the German islands of [[Borkum]] and [[Sylt]]. No further investigation was made and the memo was filed away.\n\nIn 1940 the civil engineer [[Guy Maunsell]] wrote to the [[War Office]] with a proposal for an artificial harbour, but the idea was not at first adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Maunsell_G/maunsellGuy5.asp |title=Engineering Timelines - Guy Maunsell - WWII : sea forts + harbours |website=www.engineering-timelines.com |access-date=16 March 2020 }}</ref>\nChurchill issued his memo \"Piers for use on beaches\" on 30 May 1942, apparently in some frustration at the lack of progress being made on finding a solution to the temporary harbour problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2015/02/user-requirement-document-piers-use-beaches/|title=A User Requirement Document - Piers for Use on Beaches |publisher=Think Defence|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref> Between 17 June and 6 August 1942, [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] submitted a design concept for artificial harbours to the War Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historicaldocuments.weebly.com/hughes-war-plans.html|title=Hughes War Plans - Mulberry Harbours|work=Kaller Historical Documents|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt a meeting following the [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942, [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[John Hughes-Hallett]] (the naval commander for the Dieppe Raid) declared that if a port could not be captured, then one should be taken across the [[English Channel|Channel]]. Hughes-Hallett had the support of Churchill. The concept of Mulberry harbours began to take shape when Hughes-Hallett moved to be Naval Chief of Staff to the [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]] planners.\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, the [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Chief of Combined Operations]] Vice-Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], outlined the requirement for piers at least a mile long at which a continuous stream of supplies could be handled, including a pier head capable of handling 2,000-ton ships.\n\nIn July 1943 a committee of eminent civil engineers consisting of Colin R White (Chairman), J D C Couper, J A Cochrane, R D Gwyther and Lt. Col. Ivor Bell was established to advise on how a number of selected sites on the French coastline could be converted into sheltered harbours. The committee initially investigated the use of compressed air breakwaters before eventually deciding on blockships and caissons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf |title=Artificioal Habours |publisher=War Office |access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Trials===\nIn August and September 1943 a trial of three competing designs for the cargo-handling jetties was set up together with a test of a compressed air breakwater. The pier designs were by:\n* [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] (a civil engineer) who developed his \"Hippo\" piers and \"Crocodile\" bridge spans;\n* Ronald Hamilton (working at the [[Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]]) who devised the \"Swiss Roll\" which consisted of a floating roadway made of waterproofed canvas stiffened with slats and tensioned by cables;\n* Lieutenant Colonel William T Everall and [[Allan Beckett|Major Allan Beckett]] (of the War Office's 'Transportation 5 Department' (Tn5)) who designed a floating bridge linked to a pier head (the latter had integral 'spud' legs that were raised and lowered with the tide).\n\nPrototypes of each of the designs were built and tested at Rigg Bay on the [[Solway Firth]]. The tests revealed various problems (the \"Swiss Roll\" would only take a maximum of a 7-ton truck in the Atlantic swell). However the final choice of design was determined by a storm during which the \"Hippos\" were undermined causing the \"Crocodile\" bridge spans to fail and the Swiss Roll was washed away. Tn5's design proved the most successful and Beckett's floating roadway (subsequently codenamed 'Whale') survived undamaged; the design was adopted and {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of Whale roadway were manufactured under the management of [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]] and [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Bruce White]], the Director of Ports and Inland Water Transport at the War Office.\n\n==Harbour elements and code names==\n\nBelow are listed brief details of the major elements of the harbours together with their associated [[Code name|military code names]].\n\n===Mulberry===\n[[File:Arromanches Mulberry-Harbour Phoenix-Elements 1 90.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the harbour off Arromanches in 1990]]\nMulberry was the codename for all the various different structures that would create the artificial harbours. These were the \"Gooseberries\" which metamorphosed into fully fledged harbours. There were two harbours, Mulberry \"A\" and Mulberry \"B\". The \"Mulberry\" harbours consisted of a floating outer breakwater called \"[[Bombardon breakwater|Bombardons]]\", a static breakwater consisting of \"Corncobs\" and reinforced concrete caissons called \"Phoenix\", floating piers or roadways codenamed \"Whales\" and \"Beetles\" and pier heads codenamed \"Spuds\". These harbours were both of a similar size to [[Dover#History|Dover harbour]]. In the planning of [[Operation Neptune]] the term Mulberry \"B\" was defined as, \"An artificial harbour to be built in England and towed to the British beaches at Arromanches.\"{{sfn|Crawford|1944|p=1}}\n\n====Mulberry \"A\"====\nThe Mulberry harbour assembled on [[Omaha Beach]] at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] was for use by the American invasion forces.  Mulberry \"A\" (American) was not securely anchored to the sea bed as Mulberry \"B\" had been by the British, resulting in such severe damage during the Channel storms of late June 1944 that it was considered to be irreparable and its further assembly ceased.<ref>{{cite web|title=Omaha Beach Mulberry Harbor|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/project/d-day-1944/results-discussion/omaha-beach-mulberry-harbor|publisher=Centre for Coastal and Ocean Mapping|access-date=17 December 2015|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> It was commanded by [[Augustus Dayton Clark]].\n\n====Mulberry \"B\"====\nMulberry \"B\" (British) was the harbour assembled on [[Gold Beach]] at Arromanches for use by the British and Canadian invasion forces. The harbour was unofficially named \"Port Winston\"<ref>{{cite web|title='Port Winston' Mulberry harbour built off Normandy after D-Day is uncovered on the seabed 69 years later|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2297365/Port-Winston-harbour-built-Normandy-D-Day-uncovered-seabed-69-years-on.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=17 December 2015|first=Martin|last=Robinson|date=22 March 2013}}</ref> and was decommissioned six months after D-Day as allied forces were able to use the recently captured [[port of Antwerp]] to offload troops and supplies. Mulberry 'B' was operated by 20 Port Group, Royal Engineers under the command of Lt. Col. G C B Shaddick.\n\n===Breakwaters===\n====Corncobs and Gooseberries (breakwater ships)====\n''Corncobs'' were ships that crossed the [[English Channel]] (either under their own steam or towed) and were then [[scuttling|scuttled]] to act as breakwaters and create sheltered water at the five landing beaches. Once in position the ''Corncobs'' created the sheltered waters known as ''Gooseberries''.\n\nThe ships used for each beach were:\n* [[Utah Beach]] (Gooseberry 1): {{SS|Benjamin Contee||2}}, ''David O.

There were six different sizes of caisson (with [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]]s of approximately 2,000 tons to 6,000 tons each<ref>{{cite web|title=Caisson (Phoenix) Breakwater|url=http://worldwar2headquarters.com/HTML/normandy/mulberries/phoenix-breakwater.html|publisher=worldwar2heritage.com|accessdate=28 July 2018|author=|date=}}</ref>) and each unit was towed to Normandy by two [[Type V ship|tugs]] at around three knots. The caissons were initially sunk awaiting D-Day and then engineers refloated (\"resurrected\", hence the name) the Phoenixes and US Navy Captain (later Rear Admiral) [[Edward Ellsberg]], already well known for quickly refloating [[Scuttling|scuttled]] ships at [[Massawa]] and [[Oran]], was brought in to accomplish the task, though not without obtaining Churchill's intervention in taking the task away from the Royal Engineers and giving it to the Royal Navy. The Phoenixes, once refloated, were towed across the channel to form the \"Mulberry\" harbour breakwaters together with the \"Gooseberry\" block ships. Ellsberg rode one of the concrete caissons to Normandy; once there he helped unsnarl wrecked landing craft and vehicles on the beach.\n\n====Bombardons====\n{{main|Bombardon breakwater}}\nThe ''Bombardons'' were large {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} cross-shaped floating breakwaters fabricated in steel that were anchored outside the main breakwaters that consisted of Gooseberries (scuttled ships) and Phoenixes (concrete caissons). 24 bombardon units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, would create a {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} breakwater. During the storms at the end of June 1944 some Bombardons broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage to the harbours than the storm itself. The design of the Bombardons was the responsibility of the Royal Navy while the Royal Engineers were responsible for the design of the rest of the Mulberry harbour equipment.\n\n===Roadways===\n====Whales====\n[[Image:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A Whale floating roadway leading to a Spud pier at Mulberry A off [[Omaha Beach]] ]]\nThe dock piers were code named ''Whales''. These piers were the floating roadways that connected the \"Spud\" pier heads to the land. Designed by [[Allan Beckett]] the roadways were made from innovative torsionally flexible bridging units that had a span of 80&nbsp;ft., mounted on pontoon units of either steel or concrete called \"Beetles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|title=Some Aspects of the Design of Flexible Bridging Including 'Whale' Floating Roadways - A H Beckett|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707221355/http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-07}}</ref> After the war many of the \"Whale\" bridge spans from Arromanches were used to repair bombed bridges in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Such units are still visible as a bridge over the [http://www.normandythenandnow.com/a-rare-piece-of-d-day-history-in-this-sleepy-normandy-valley/ Noireau river in Normandy], [[Meuse River]] in [[Vacherauville]] ([[Meuse (department)|Meuse]]), as a bridge over the [[Moselle River]] on road D56 between [[Cattenom]] and [[K\u0153nigsmacker]] ([[Moselle]]) and in [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] ([[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]) along road D517. In 1954, some whales were also used to build for two bridges (still visible) in Cameroon along the Edea to Kribi road. In the 1960s, three Whale spans from Arromanches were used at [[Ford Dagenham]] to allow cars to be driven from the assembly line directly onto car-carrying ships. A Whale span from Mulberry B that was reused after the war at [[Pont-Farcy]] was saved from destruction in 2008 by ''Les Amis du Pont Bailey'', a group of English and French volunteers. Seeking a permanent home for the Whale span the group gifted it to the Imperial War Museum and it was returned to England in July 2015. After conservation work the span now features as part of the Land Warfare exhibition at [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]].\n\n====Beetles====\n''Beetles'' were pontoons that supported the ''Whale'' piers. They were moored in position using wires attached to \"Kite\" anchors which were also designed by [[Allan Beckett]]. These anchors had such high holding power that very few could be recovered at the end of the War. The Navy was dismissive of Beckett's claims for his anchor's holding ability so Kite anchors were not used for mooring the bombardons. An original Kite anchor is displayed in a private museum at Vierville-sur-Mer while a full size replica forms part of a memorial to Beckett in Arromanches. In October 2018 five Kite anchors were recovered from the bed of the Solent off Woodside Beach, which had been an assembly area for Whale tows prior to D Day. The anchors were taken to Mary Rose Archaeological Services in Portsmouth for conservation treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beckettrankine.com/world-war-2-kite-anchors-found-and-recovered/|title=World war 2 Kite anchors found and recovered|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Spud Piers===\nThe pier heads or landing wharves at which ships were unloaded. Each of these consisted of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide.\n\n==Deployment==\n[[Image:MulberryA - wrecked pontoon causeway after storm.jpg|thumb|Wrecked pontoon causeway of one of the \"Mulberry\" artificial harbours, following the storm of 19\u201322 June 1944.]]\n\nOn the afternoon of 6 June 1944 (D-Day) over 400 towed component parts (weighing approximately 1.5 million tons) set sail to create the two Mulberry harbours. It included all the blockships (codenamed Corncobs) to create the outer breakwater (Gooseberries) and 146 concrete caissons (Phoenixes).\n\n===Arromanches Mulberry===\nAt [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]], the first Phoenix was sunk at dawn on 9 June 1944. By 15 June a further 115 had been sunk to create a five-mile-long arc between [[Tracy-sur-Mer]] in the west to [[Asnelles]] in the east. To protect the new anchorage, the superstructures of the blockships (which remained above sea-level) and the concrete caissons were festooned with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and [[barrage balloon]]s.\n\n===Omaha Mulberry===\nArriving first on D-Day itself were the Bombardons followed a day later by the first blockship. The first Phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the Gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four pier heads were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued to be used for landing vehicles and stores using [[Landing Ship Tank]]s (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the artificial port were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulberry Harbours |url=http://www.normandiememoire.com/en/content/view/id-68-mulberry-harbours |website=normandiememoire.com |access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Storm of 19 June 1944===\nBoth harbours were almost fully functional when on 19 June a large north-east storm at Force 6 to 8 blew into Normandy and devastated the Mulberry harbour at Omaha Beach. The harbours had been designed with summer weather conditions in mind but this was the worst storm to hit the Normandy coast in 40 years.\n\nThe destruction at Omaha was so bad that the entire harbour was deemed irreparable. 21 of the 28 Phoenix caissons were completely destroyed, the Bombardons were cast adrift, and the roadways and piers smashed.\n\nThe Mulberry harbour at Arromanches was more protected, and although damaged by the storm it remained intact. It came to be known as '''Port Winston'''. While the harbour at Omaha was destroyed sooner than expected, Port Winston saw heavy use for eight months, despite being designed to last only three months.

Port Winston is commonly upheld as one of the best examples of [[military engineer]]ing. Its remains are still visible today from the beaches at Arromanches.\n\n== Post-war analysis ==\nPost-war (particularly American) historians say that although it was a success, the vast resources used on the Mulberry may have been wasted, as the American forces were supplied mostly over the beaches without the use of a Mulberry right through to September 1944. By the end of 6 June, 20,000 troops and 1,700 vehicles had landed on Utah beach (the shortest beach). At Omaha and Utah, 6,614 tons of cargo was discharged in the first 3 days. A month after D-Day, Omaha and Utah were handling 9,200 tons, and after a further month, they were landing 16,000 tons per day. This increased until 56,200 tons of supplies, 20,000 vehicles, and 180,000 troops were discharged each day at those beaches. The Mulberry harbours provided less than half the total (on good weather days) to begin with.{{sfn|Godfrey|2003|p=44}} The Normandy Beaches supplied the following average daily tonnage of supplies:\n \n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | Average Daily Tonnage of Supplies Landed, Normandy 1944 {{sfn|Osmanski|1950|p=57}}\n|-\n!

After the Allies successfully held beachheads following [[D-Day]], two prefabricated harbours were taken in sections across the [[English Channel]] from UK with the invading army and assembled off [[Omaha Beach]] (Mulberry \"A\") and [[Gold Beach]] (Mulberry \"B\").\n\nThe Mulberry harbours were to be used until major French ports could be captured and brought back into use after repair of the inevitable sabotage by German defenders. The Mulberry B harbour at [[Gold Beach]] was used for 10 months after D-Day, and over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies were landed before it was fully decommissioned. The still only partially-completed Mulberry A harbour at [[Omaha Beach]] was damaged on 19 June by a violent storm that suddenly arrived from the north-east. After three days the storm finally abated and damage was found to be so severe that the harbour had to be abandoned.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Dieppe Raid]] of 1942 had shown that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] could not rely on being able to penetrate the [[Atlantic Wall]] to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed [[Draft (hull)|sufficient depth of water]] under their [[keel]]s, together with [[Crane (machine)|dockside cranes]], to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain [[Operation Overlord]]. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], [[pier]]s and roadways.\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Construction of Mulberry Harbours, Southampton, April 1944 A25792.jpg|thumb|[[Phoenix breakwater|Phoenix caissons]] under construction, Southampton 1944]]\nWith the planning of [[Operation Overlord]] at an advanced stage by the summer of 1943, it was accepted that the proposed artificial harbours would need to be prefabricated in the UK and then towed across the English Channel.\n\nThe need for two separate artificial harbours \u2013 one American and one British/Canadian \u2013 was agreed at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. An Artificial Harbours Sub-Committee was set up under the Chairmanship of the civil engineer Colin R White (Sir Bruce White's brother) to advise on the location of the harbour and the form of the breakwater; the Sub-Committee's first meeting was held at the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) on 4 August 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf|title=War Office: Artificial Harbours|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> The minutes of the Sub-Committee's meetings show that initially it was envisaged that bubble breakwaters would be used, then block ships were proposed and finally, due to an insufficient number of block ships being available, a mix of block ships and purpose made concrete caisson units.\n\nOn 2 September 1943 the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] estimated that the artificial ports (Mulberries) would need to handle 12,000 tons per day, exclusive of motor transport and in all weathers. On 4 September the go ahead was given to start work immediately on the harbours. However, infighting between the [[War Office]] and the [[Admiralty]] over responsibility was only resolved on 15 December 1943 by the intervention of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff. The decision was that the Admiralty managed the blockships, Bombardons and assembly of all constituent parts on the south coast of England. Further the Admiralty would undertake all necessary work to survey, site, tow and mark navigation.\n\nThe War Office was given the task of constructing the concrete caissons (Phoenixes), the roadways (Whales) and protection via anti-aircraft installations. Once at the site, the army was responsible for sinking the caissons and assembling all the various other units of the harbours.\n\nFor the Mulberry A at Omaha Beach, the naval Corps of Civil Engineers would construct the harbour from the prefabricated parts.\n\nThe proposed harbours called for many huge [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] of various sorts to build breakwaters and piers and connecting structures to provide the roadways. The caissons were built at a number of locations, mainly existing ship building facilities or large beaches, like Conwy Morfa, around the British coast. The works were let out to commercial construction firms including [[Wates Group|Wates Construction]] [[Balfour Beatty]], [[Henry Boot PLC|Henry Boot]], [[Lend Lease Project Management & Construction|Bovis & Co]], [[Cochrane Shipbuilders|Cochrane & Sons]], [[Costain Group|Costain]], [[Holland, Hannen & Cubitts|Cubitts]], [[W. & C. French|French]], [[Holloway Brothers (London)|Holloway Brothers]], [[John Laing Group|John Laing & Son]], [[Peter Lind & Company]], [[Sir Robert McAlpine]], [[Melville Dundas|Melville Dundas & Whitson]], [[Mowlem]], [[BAM Nuttall|Nuttall]], [[Sir Lindsay Parkinson|Parkinson]], [[Halcrow Group]], [[Pauling & Co.]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]].{{sfn|Hartcup|2011|p=94}} On completion they were towed across the English Channel by [[Tugboat|tugs]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Thames Tugs |url=http://www.thamestugs.co.uk/BRITISH-TUGS.php |title=Mulberry Harbour: British, French and Dutch tugs' |access-date=20 April 2009}}</ref> to the Normandy coast at only {{convert|4.3|kn|km/h|order=flip}}, assembled, operated and maintained by the [[Royal Engineers|Corps of Royal Engineers]], under the guidance of Reginald D. Gwyther, who was appointed CBE for his efforts. Various elements of the \"Whale\" piers were designed and constructed by a group of companies led by Braithwaite & Co, West Bromwich and Newport.\n\n===Beach surveys===\nBoth locations for the temporary harbours required detailed information concerning [[geology]], [[hydrography]] and sea conditions. To collect this data a special team of hydrographers was created in October 1943. The 712th Survey Flotilla, operated from [[Stone frigate|naval base]] [[List of Royal Navy shore establishments#S to Z|HMS ''Tormentor'']] in [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]], were detailed to collect soundings off the enemy coast. Between November 1943 and January 1944 this team used a [[LCPL|Landing Craft Personnel (Large)]], or LCP(L), to survey the Normandy coast.\n\nThe special LCP(L) was manned by a Royal Navy crew and a small group of hydrographers. The first sortie, Operation KJF, occurred on the night of 26/27 November 1943 when three LCP(L)s took measurements off the port of Arromanches, the location for Mulberry B. A follow up mission, Operation KJG, to the proposed location for Mulberry A happened on 1/2 December but a navigation failure meant the team sounded an area 2,250 yards west of the correct area.\n\nTwo attempts had to be made to take soundings off the [[Ver-sur-Mer|Point de Ver]]. The first sortie, Operation Bellpush Able, on 25/26 December had issues with their equipment and returned on 28/29 December to complete the task.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1943, a [[Combined Operations Headquarters#Operations|Combined Operations Pilotage Party]] (COPP), left Gosport for the Gold Beach area at [[Luc-sur-Mer]]. Two soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]], Major Scott-Bowden and [[Sergeant#Royal Marines and British Army|Sergeant]] Ogden-Smith, were landed on the beach at night in [[Operation Postage Able]] and took samples of the sand. These were crucial in determining whether the armoured vehicles would be able to operate on the beach or become bogged down. The final survey, Operation Bellpush Charlie, occurred on the night of 30\u201331 January but limited information was gathered due to fog and because German lookouts heard the craft. Further sorties were abandoned.{{sfn|Falconer|2013|pp=69\u201371}}\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:MulberryB - Piers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Aerial view of Mulberry harbour \"B\" at [[Arromanches]] (October 27, 1944)]]\nAn early idea for temporary harbours was sketched by [[Winston Churchill]] in a 1915 memo to [[Lloyd George]]. This memo was for artificial harbours to be created off the German islands of [[Borkum]] and [[Sylt]]. No further investigation was made and the memo was filed away.\n\nIn 1940 the civil engineer [[Guy Maunsell]] wrote to the [[War Office]] with a proposal for an artificial harbour, but the idea was not at first adopted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Maunsell_G/maunsellGuy5.asp |title=Engineering Timelines - Guy Maunsell - WWII : sea forts + harbours |website=www.engineering-timelines.com |access-date=16 March 2020 }}</ref>\nChurchill issued his memo \"Piers for use on beaches\" on 30 May 1942, apparently in some frustration at the lack of progress being made on finding a solution to the temporary harbour problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2015/02/user-requirement-document-piers-use-beaches/|title=A User Requirement Document - Piers for Use on Beaches |publisher=Think Defence|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref> Between 17 June and 6 August 1942, [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] submitted a design concept for artificial harbours to the War Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historicaldocuments.weebly.com/hughes-war-plans.html|title=Hughes War Plans - Mulberry Harbours|work=Kaller Historical Documents|access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt a meeting following the [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942, [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[John Hughes-Hallett]] (the naval commander for the Dieppe Raid) declared that if a port could not be captured, then one should be taken across the [[English Channel|Channel]]. Hughes-Hallett had the support of Churchill. The concept of Mulberry harbours began to take shape when Hughes-Hallett moved to be Naval Chief of Staff to the [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]] planners.\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, the [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Chief of Combined Operations]] Vice-Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], outlined the requirement for piers at least a mile long at which a continuous stream of supplies could be handled, including a pier head capable of handling 2,000-ton ships.\n\nIn July 1943 a committee of eminent civil engineers consisting of Colin R White (Chairman), J D C Couper, J A Cochrane, R D Gwyther and Lt. Col. Ivor Bell was established to advise on how a number of selected sites on the French coastline could be converted into sheltered harbours. The committee initially investigated the use of compressed air breakwaters before eventually deciding on blockships and caissons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mulberryharbour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.-War-Office.-Artificial-Harbours1.pdf |title=Artificioal Habours |publisher=War Office |access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Trials===\nIn August and September 1943 a trial of three competing designs for the cargo-handling jetties was set up together with a test of a compressed air breakwater. The pier designs were by:\n* [[Hugh Iorys Hughes]] (a civil engineer) who developed his \"Hippo\" piers and \"Crocodile\" bridge spans;\n* Ronald Hamilton (working at the [[Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]]) who devised the \"Swiss Roll\" which consisted of a floating roadway made of waterproofed canvas stiffened with slats and tensioned by cables;\n* Lieutenant Colonel William T Everall and [[Allan Beckett|Major Allan Beckett]] (of the War Office's 'Transportation 5 Department' (Tn5)) who designed a floating bridge linked to a pier head (the latter had integral 'spud' legs that were raised and lowered with the tide).\n\nPrototypes of each of the designs were built and tested at Rigg Bay on the [[Solway Firth]]. The tests revealed various problems (the \"Swiss Roll\" would only take a maximum of a 7-ton truck in the Atlantic swell). However the final choice of design was determined by a storm during which the \"Hippos\" were undermined causing the \"Crocodile\" bridge spans to fail and the Swiss Roll was washed away. Tn5's design proved the most successful and Beckett's floating roadway (subsequently codenamed 'Whale') survived undamaged; the design was adopted and {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of Whale roadway were manufactured under the management of [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]] and [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Bruce White]], the Director of Ports and Inland Water Transport at the War Office.\n\n==Harbour elements and code names==\n\nBelow are listed brief details of the major elements of the harbours together with their associated [[Code name|military code names]].\n\n===Mulberry===\n[[File:Arromanches Mulberry-Harbour Phoenix-Elements 1 90.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the harbour off Arromanches in 1990]]\nMulberry was the codename for all the various different structures that would create the artificial harbours. These were the \"Gooseberries\" which metamorphosed into fully fledged harbours. There were two harbours, Mulberry \"A\" and Mulberry \"B\". The \"Mulberry\" harbours consisted of a floating outer breakwater called \"[[Bombardon breakwater|Bombardons]]\", a static breakwater consisting of \"Corncobs\" and reinforced concrete caissons called \"Phoenix\", floating piers or roadways codenamed \"Whales\" and \"Beetles\" and pier heads codenamed \"Spuds\". These harbours were both of a similar size to [[Dover#History|Dover harbour]]. In the planning of [[Operation Neptune]] the term Mulberry \"B\" was defined as, \"An artificial harbour to be built in England and towed to the British beaches at Arromanches.\"{{sfn|Crawford|1944|p=1}}\n\n====Mulberry \"A\"====\nThe Mulberry harbour assembled on [[Omaha Beach]] at [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] was for use by the American invasion forces.  Mulberry \"A\" (American) was not securely anchored to the sea bed as Mulberry \"B\" had been by the British, resulting in such severe damage during the Channel storms of late June 1944 that it was considered to be irreparable and its further assembly ceased.<ref>{{cite web|title=Omaha Beach Mulberry Harbor|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/project/d-day-1944/results-discussion/omaha-beach-mulberry-harbor|publisher=Centre for Coastal and Ocean Mapping|access-date=17 December 2015|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> It was commanded by [[Augustus Dayton Clark]].\n\n====Mulberry \"B\"====\nMulberry \"B\" (British) was the harbour assembled on [[Gold Beach]] at Arromanches for use by the British and Canadian invasion forces. The harbour was unofficially named \"Port Winston\"<ref>{{cite web|title='Port Winston' Mulberry harbour built off Normandy after D-Day is uncovered on the seabed 69 years later|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2297365/Port-Winston-harbour-built-Normandy-D-Day-uncovered-seabed-69-years-on.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=17 December 2015|first=Martin|last=Robinson|date=22 March 2013}}</ref> and was decommissioned six months after D-Day as allied forces were able to use the recently captured [[port of Antwerp]] to offload troops and supplies. Mulberry 'B' was operated by 20 Port Group, Royal Engineers under the command of Lt. Col. G C B Shaddick.\n\n===Breakwaters===\n====Corncobs and Gooseberries (breakwater ships)====\n''Corncobs'' were ships that crossed the [[English Channel]] (either under their own steam or towed) and were then [[scuttling|scuttled]] to act as breakwaters and create sheltered water at the five landing beaches. Once in position the ''Corncobs'' created the sheltered waters known as ''Gooseberries''.\n\nThe ships used for each beach were:\n* [[Utah Beach]] (Gooseberry 1): ''Benjamin Contee'', ''David O.

There were six different sizes of caisson (with [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]]s of approximately 2,000 tons to 6,000 tons each<ref>{{cite web|title=Caisson (Phoenix) Breakwater|url=http://worldwar2headquarters.com/HTML/normandy/mulberries/phoenix-breakwater.html|publisher=worldwar2heritage.com|accessdate=28 July 2018|author=|date=}}</ref>) and each unit was towed to Normandy by two [[Type V ship|tugs]] at around three knots. The caissons were initially sunk awaiting D-Day and then engineers refloated (\"resurrected\", hence the name) the Phoenixes and US Navy Captain (later Rear Admiral) [[Edward Ellsberg]], already well known for quickly refloating [[Scuttling|scuttled]] ships at [[Massawa]] and [[Oran]], was brought in to accomplish the task, though not without obtaining Churchill's intervention in taking the task away from the Royal Engineers and giving it to the Royal Navy. The Phoenixes, once refloated, were towed across the channel to form the \"Mulberry\" harbour breakwaters together with the \"Gooseberry\" block ships. Ellsberg rode one of the concrete caissons to Normandy; once there he helped unsnarl wrecked landing craft and vehicles on the beach.\n\n====Bombardons====\n{{main|Bombardon breakwater}}\nThe ''Bombardons'' were large {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} cross-shaped floating breakwaters fabricated in steel that were anchored outside the main breakwaters that consisted of Gooseberries (scuttled ships) and Phoenixes (concrete caissons). 24 bombardon units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, would create a {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} breakwater. During the storms at the end of June 1944 some Bombardons broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage to the harbours than the storm itself. The design of the Bombardons was the responsibility of the Royal Navy while the Royal Engineers were responsible for the design of the rest of the Mulberry harbour equipment.\n\n===Roadways===\n====Whales====\n[[Image:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A Whale floating roadway leading to a Spud pier at Mulberry A off [[Omaha Beach]] ]]\nThe dock piers were code named ''Whales''. These piers were the floating roadways that connected the \"Spud\" pier heads to the land. Designed by [[Allan Beckett]] the roadways were made from innovative torsionally flexible bridging units that had a span of 80&nbsp;ft., mounted on pontoon units of either steel or concrete called \"Beetles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|title=Some Aspects of the Design of Flexible Bridging Including 'Whale' Floating Roadways - A H Beckett|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707221355/http://www.beckettrankine.com/downloads/mulberry01.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-07}}</ref> After the war many of the \"Whale\" bridge spans from Arromanches were used to repair bombed bridges in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Such units are still visible as a bridge over the [http://www.normandythenandnow.com/a-rare-piece-of-d-day-history-in-this-sleepy-normandy-valley/ Noireau river in Normandy], [[Meuse River]] in [[Vacherauville]] ([[Meuse (department)|Meuse]]), as a bridge over the [[Moselle River]] on road D56 between [[Cattenom]] and [[K\u0153nigsmacker]] ([[Moselle]]) and in [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] ([[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]) along road D517. In 1954, some whales were also used to build for two bridges (still visible) in Cameroon along the Edea to Kribi road. In the 1960s, three Whale spans from Arromanches were used at [[Ford Dagenham]] to allow cars to be driven from the assembly line directly onto car-carrying ships. A Whale span from Mulberry B that was reused after the war at [[Pont-Farcy]] was saved from destruction in 2008 by ''Les Amis du Pont Bailey'', a group of English and French volunteers. Seeking a permanent home for the Whale span the group gifted it to the Imperial War Museum and it was returned to England in July 2015. After conservation work the span now features as part of the Land Warfare exhibition at [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]].\n\n====Beetles====\n''Beetles'' were pontoons that supported the ''Whale'' piers. They were moored in position using wires attached to \"Kite\" anchors which were also designed by [[Allan Beckett]]. These anchors had such high holding power that very few could be recovered at the end of the War. The Navy was dismissive of Beckett's claims for his anchor's holding ability so Kite anchors were not used for mooring the bombardons. An original Kite anchor is displayed in a private museum at Vierville-sur-Mer while a full size replica forms part of a memorial to Beckett in Arromanches. In October 2018 five Kite anchors were recovered from the bed of the Solent off Woodside Beach, which had been an assembly area for Whale tows prior to D Day. The anchors were taken to Mary Rose Archaeological Services in Portsmouth for conservation treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beckettrankine.com/world-war-2-kite-anchors-found-and-recovered/|title=World war 2 Kite anchors found and recovered|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Spud Piers===\nThe pier heads or landing wharves at which ships were unloaded. Each of these consisted of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide.\n\n==Deployment==\n[[Image:MulberryA - wrecked pontoon causeway after storm.jpg|thumb|Wrecked pontoon causeway of one of the \"Mulberry\" artificial harbours, following the storm of 19\u201322 June 1944.]]\n\nOn the afternoon of 6 June 1944 (D-Day) over 400 towed component parts (weighing approximately 1.5 million tons) set sail to create the two Mulberry harbours. It included all the blockships (codenamed Corncobs) to create the outer breakwater (Gooseberries) and 146 concrete caissons (Phoenixes).\n\n===Arromanches Mulberry===\nAt [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]], the first Phoenix was sunk at dawn on 9 June 1944. By 15 June a further 115 had been sunk to create a five-mile-long arc between [[Tracy-sur-Mer]] in the west to [[Asnelles]] in the east. To protect the new anchorage, the superstructures of the blockships (which remained above sea-level) and the concrete caissons were festooned with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and [[barrage balloon]]s.\n\n===Omaha Mulberry===\nArriving first on D-Day itself were the Bombardons followed a day later by the first blockship. The first Phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the Gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four pier heads were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued to be used for landing vehicles and stores using [[Landing Ship Tank]]s (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the artificial port were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulberry Harbours |url=http://www.normandiememoire.com/en/content/view/id-68-mulberry-harbours |website=normandiememoire.com |access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Storm of 19 June 1944===\nBoth harbours were almost fully functional when on 19 June a large north-east storm at Force 6 to 8 blew into Normandy and devastated the Mulberry harbour at Omaha Beach. The harbours had been designed with summer weather conditions in mind but this was the worst storm to hit the Normandy coast in 40 years.\n\nThe destruction at Omaha was so bad that the entire harbour was deemed irreparable. 21 of the 28 Phoenix caissons were completely destroyed, the Bombardons were cast adrift, and the roadways and piers smashed.\n\nThe Mulberry harbour at Arromanches was more protected, and although damaged by the storm it remained intact. It came to be known as '''Port Winston'''. While the harbour at Omaha was destroyed sooner than expected, Port Winston saw heavy use for eight months, despite being designed to last only three months. In the 10 months after D-Day, it was used to land over 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies providing much needed reinforcements in France.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mulberry Harbour|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/mulberry_harbour.htm |website=historylearningsite.co.uk |access-date=17 December 2015}}</ref> In response to this longer than planned use the Phoenix breakwater was reinforced with the addition of specially strengthened caissons.{{sfn|Hughes|Momber|2000|pp=127\u2013128}} The [[Royal Engineers]] had built a complete Mulberry Harbour out of 600,000 tons of concrete between 33 jetties, and had {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} of floating roadways to land men and vehicles on the beach. Port Winston is commonly upheld as one of the best examples of [[military engineer]]ing. Its remains are still visible today from the beaches at Arromanches.\n\n== Post-war analysis ==\nPost-war (particularly American) historians say that although it was a success, the vast resources used on the Mulberry may have been wasted, as the American forces were supplied mostly over the beaches without the use of a Mulberry right through to September 1944. By the end of 6 June, 20,000 troops and 1,700 vehicles had landed on Utah beach (the shortest beach). At Omaha and Utah, 6,614 tons of cargo was discharged in the first 3 days. A month after D-Day, Omaha and Utah were handling 9,200 tons, and after a further month, they were landing 16,000 tons per day. This increased until 56,200 tons of supplies, 20,000 vehicles, and 180,000 troops were discharged each day at those beaches. The Mulberry harbours provided less than half the total (on good weather days) to begin with.{{sfn|Godfrey|2003|p=44}} The Normandy Beaches supplied the following average daily tonnage of supplies:\n \n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | Average Daily Tonnage of Supplies Landed, Normandy 1944 {{sfn|Osmanski|1950|p=57}}\n|-\n!

Up to September, U.S. forces were supported largely across the beaches, primarily without the use of the Mulberry.\"However, in the critical early stage of the operation, had the Allied assault ships been caught in the open without the benefit of any protection, the damage in the American sector especially could have been catastrophic to the lines of supply and communication.\"{{sfn|Antill|Bradford Case|Moore|2011|p=63}}\n\n\"Mulberry B was substantially reinforced with units salvaged from the American harbor and that the Phoenixes were pumped full of sand to give them greater stability, measures that undoubtedly explain the extended service which the British port was able to render.
