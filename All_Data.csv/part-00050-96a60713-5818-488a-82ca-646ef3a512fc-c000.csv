'''''Echo In The Canyon''''' is a 2018 film directed by Andrew Slater. The film is produced by Eric Barrett, and Andrew Slater under the banner of Mirror Films. The film stars [[Lou Adler]], [[Fiona Apple]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Beck]], Justine Bennett, [[Tom Petty]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], [[The Byrds]], [[Jade Castrinos]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[David Crosby]], [[Jakob Dylan]], [[Norah Jones]], and [[Michelle Phillips]].

It had its world premiere at the [[LA Film Festival]] on September 20, 2018. It was released in theaters May 24, 2019. An accompanying soundtrack has also been released on CD, vinyl and digitally featuring Jakob Dylan and guests such as Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Fiona Apple and Beck amongst others.

== Plot ==
''Echo In The Canyon'' celebrates the popular music that came out of L.A.’s [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] neighborhood in the mid-60s as folk went electric and The Byrds, The Beach Boys, Buffalo Springfield, and [[The Mamas and the Papas]] cemented the [[California Sound]]. It was a moment (1965 to 1967) when bands came to L.A. to emulate [[The Beatles]] and Laurel Canyon emerged as a hotbed of creativity and collaboration for a new generation of musicians who would soon put an indelible stamp on the history of American popular music.  

Hosted by [[Jakob Dylan]], the film explores the Laurel Canyon scene via never-before-heard personal details behind the bands and their songs and how that music continues to inspire today.  The songs from that era provide an entry point as Dylan and some of his fellow musicians interpret and perform many of these classic songs in concert at L.A.'s Orpheum Theatre.

''Echo in the Canyon'' contains candid conversations and performances with [[Brian Wilson]] (The Beach Boys), Michelle Phillips (Mamas & the Papas), [[Stephen Stills]] (Buffalo Springfield), David Crosby (The Byrds), [[Roger McGuinn]] (The Byrds) their contemporaries [[Ringo Starr]], Eric Clapton, [[Graham Nash]] and slightly younger followers Jackson Browne and [[Tom Petty]] (in his last film interview) as well as contemporary musicians influenced by their music such as [[Beck]], [[Fiona Apple]], [[Cat Power]], [[Regina Spektor]] and [[Norah Jones]].

{{Japanese name|Mori}}

{{nihongo|'''Jūzō Mori'''|森 拾三|Mori Jūzō|}} was a [[torpedo bomber]] pilot in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]]. He flew [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bomber from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|''Sōryū'']] during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[Indian Ocean Raid]] and the [[Battle of Midway]]. He was shot down during the [[Solomon Islands Campaign]] while flying from carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'yō|''Jun'yō'']] but survived the crash and was eventually evacuated to Japan.

==Early career==
Jūzō Mori was born in on 9 February 1917 in a small town in [[Saitama Prefecture]] to a poor farmer family. He wanted to become a teacher but the family could not afford the entrance fee for the school. He then moved to [[Tokyo]] to live with his uncle. He found him a job in the department store, while at the same time he attended a night school. However, in January 1935 his father died and he was forced to return to his home town in order to support the family. In August he noticed a navy recruiting poster and decided to join the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. He passed the entrance test in January 1936 but almost failed the physical exam as his chest measurement was to small. He enlisted the navy as a navy and in June left for [[Yokosuka]] naval base to start the basic training. In November he transferred to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] Training Naval Air Station (NAS) near [[Tokyo]] to begin pilot training. He graduated from the 38th class in 1938 and specialized for torpedo bombing.

In April 1938, Mori was assigned to the 12th Air Group based near [[Nanjing]] in [[Central China]]. He flew [[Aichi D1A]] bomber and participated in various operations along [[Yangtze River]]. In September, the unit transitioned to the new [[Nakajima B5N]] bombers. During one of the September mission on near [[Jiujiang]], Mori experienced an engine failure in the new aircraft and was forced to land in a nearby field controlled by [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. In November, while flying a mission from [[Hankou]], his B5N ran out of fuel due to a problem and he again was forced to land in a field near [[Yangtze River]]. This time he and his crew ended up in enemy territory but they were rescued the next day. He left China in December 1938 and in January 1939 he was transferred back to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] NAS to serve as an instructor. In May he was promoted to [[Petty Officer Third Class]].

In September 1941 he was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|Sōryū]]'' and started the training in preparation for the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].

==Pacific War==
During the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Petty Officer Mori was part of the first wave. As his division of [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers they reached the harbor they lined up to attack the [[United States Navy]] (USN) battleship row. However, his division leader lined them up on a cruiser instead of a battleship. Mori realized the error before relasing the torpedo and and went around for another pass. He then lined up on a battleship [[USS California (BB-44)|California]] and hit it with his torpedo.

Petty Officer Mori was not directly involved in the [[Attack on Darwin]] since he was assigned to a patrol duty in the vicinity of INJ carriers.

On the return journey from Pearl Harbor, the Second Carrier Division (consisting of carriers ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|Hiryū]]'' and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|Sōryū]]'') was detached to assist in [[Battle of Wake Island|capturing]] of [[Wake Island]]. On 22 December, Petty Officer Mori and his group of B5N level bombers attacked artillery emplacements and fortifications on the island. The next day, they flew again to support the landings on the islands. When he arrived to the island, the defence already garrison surrendered as he noticed the white flag flying above their headquarters. However, while flying around the islands, one of the rouge AA emplacements opened fire and hit his fuel tank. Infuriated about it, he considered doping the remaining bombs on their position, however, he decided not risk running out of fuel and returned to the IJN fleet instead.

In April 1942, Petty Officer Mori participated in [[Indian Ocean Raid]]. He was not directly involved in actions on 5 April as he was part of a reserve force waiting on the carriers. However, on 9 April he was part of strike against [[Trincomalee]] military harbor on [[Ceylon]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb and his division performed a low-level bombing attack on hrabor installation. On their back, they encountered a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and evaded it by hiding into a cloud before safely returning to the carrier.

During the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942, Petty Officer Mori was part of the strike force against the USN airfield and installations on [[Midway Atoll]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb for level bombing. On the way to the atoll, they were intercepted by a large group of Midway-based [[United States Marines|Marine]] fighters (six [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s and 20 [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]]s) led by Major [[Floyd B. Parks]]. His aircraft was attacked by the Marine fighters, however the escorting [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s drove them away. Mori and his division of six level bombers attacked the Midway airfield. Four bombs landed and detonated on the runway, while two of them missed and hit the forest nearby. However, those two bombs appeared to have hit AA emplacement and ammo depot, since they cause a series of secondary explosions. After the attack he headed back to IJN fleet where he witnessed the unsuccessful attack on IJN carriers by the Midway-based [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] high-altitude bombers on [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']] and [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] torpedo bombers on ''Sōryū''. He landed on ''Sōryū'', which was preparing its [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers for a strike against USN carrier detected in the North-East. However, before the preparation could be finished, ''Sōryū'' was hit and set her ablaze by three bombs dropped by dive bombers of [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']] led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Max Leslie]]. Mori was in the ready room at the time of attack and had to fight through the smoke and fire to reach the deck of the carrier. As the fires intensified, he had to jump 60 from the deck into the sea and was eventually picked up by destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Makigumo (1941)|Makigumo]].

After the Battle of Midway, Petty Officer Mori was transferred to the new carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'yō|''Jun'yō'']], which sailed from Japan to Guadalcanal in early October 1942. On 16 October, He participated in the hastily organized and ill-fated air strike to attack enemy position around [[Lunga Point]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. The strike consisted of 18 B5N bombers (equipped with 800 kilogram bombs) and 18 Zero fighters, under over all command of Lieutenant Commander [[Yoshio Shiga]]. [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiyō|''Hiyō'']] bombers were led by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Irikiin, while ''Jun'yō'' bombers were led by inexperienced Lieutenant Tadao Itō. As they approached Lunga Point, Itō broke off the bombing run of the entire ''Jun'yō'' group in order to make another attempt, which infuriated Mori. During the second attempt the group was ambushed by numerous Wildcat fighters from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. In the attack three ''Hiyō'' bombers were shot down and three were damaged, while six ''Jun'yō'' bombers were shot down and 2 were damaged. The escorting Zeros claimed several Wildcats, however ''Hiyō'' ace [[Kaname Harada]] was wounded and had to ditch at [[Rekata Bay]]. Petty Officer Mori lost his right hand and was forced to ditch his bomber in the water near [[Cape Esperance]]. He then endured starvation on [[Guadalcanal]] before being evacuated to [[Truk]] in November.

==Later life==
As a result of the injury, Mori was discharged from the navy and survived the war. He later opened a bar near [[Nishi-Ogikubo Station]] in Tokyo, where he also worked as the bartender.

During one of the September mission on near [[Jiujiang]], Mori experienced an engine failure in the new aircraft and was forced to land in a nearby field controlled by [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. In November, while flying a mission from [[Hankou]], his B5N ran out of fuel due to a problem and he again was forced to land in a field near [[Yangtze River]]. This time he and his crew ended up in enemy territory but they were rescued the next day. He left China in December 1938 and in January 1939 he was transferred back to [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] NAS to serve as an instructor. In May he was promoted to [[Petty Officer Third Class]].

In September 1941 he was transferred to carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|Sōryū]]'' and started the training in preparation for the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].

==Pacific War==
During the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Petty Officer Mori was part of the first wave. As his division of [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers they reached the harbor they lined up to attack the [[United States Navy]] (USN) battleship row. However, his division leader lined them up on a cruiser instead of a battleship. Mori realized the error before relasing the torpedo and and went around for another pass. He then lined up on a battleship [[USS California (BB-44)|California]] and hit it with his torpedo.

Petty Officer Mori was not directly involved in the [[Attack on Darwin]] since he was assigned to a patrol duty in the vicinity of INJ carriers.

On the return journey from Pearl Harbor, the Second Carrier Division (consisting of carriers ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|Hiryū]]'' and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|Sōryū]]'') was detached to assist in [[Battle of Wake Island|capturing]] of [[Wake Island]]. On 22 December, Petty Officer Mori and his group of B5N level bombers attacked artillery emplacements and fortifications on the island. The next day, they flew again to support the landings on the islands. When he arrived to the island, the defence already garrison surrendered as he noticed the white flag flying above their headquarters. However, while flying around the islands, one of the rouge AA emplacements opened fire and hit his fuel tank. Infuriated about it, he considered doping the remaining bombs on their position, however, he decided not risk running out of fuel and returned to the IJN fleet instead.

In April 1942, Petty Officer Mori participated in [[Indian Ocean Raid]]. He was not directly involved in actions on 5 April as he was part of a reserve force waiting on the carriers. However, on 9 April he was part of strike against [[Trincomalee]] military harbor on [[Ceylon]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb and his division performed a low-level bombing attack on hrabor installation. On their back, they encountered a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and evaded it by hiding into a cloud before safely returning to the carrier.

During the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942, Petty Officer Mori was part of the strike force against the USN airfield and installations on [[Midway Atoll]]. His B5N was equipped with a 800 kilogram bomb for level bombing. On the way to the atoll, they were intercepted by a large group of Midway-based [[United States Marines|Marine]] fighters (six [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s and 20 [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]]s) led by Major [[Floyd B. Parks]]. His aircraft was attacked by the Marine fighters, however the escorting [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s drove them away. Mori and his division of six level bombers attacked the Midway airfield. Four bombs landed and detonated on the runway, while two of them missed and hit the forest nearby. However, those two bombs appeared to have hit AA emplacement and ammo depot, since they cause a series of secondary explosions. After the attack he headed back to IJN fleet where he witnessed the unsuccessful attack on IJN carriers by the Midway-based [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] high-altitude bombers on [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']] and [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] torpedo bombers on ''Sōryū''. He landed on ''Sōryū'', which was preparing its [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers for a strike against USN carrier detected in the North-East. However, before the preparation could be finished, ''Sōryū'' was hit and set her ablaze by three bombs dropped by dive bombers of [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']] led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Max Leslie]]. Mori was in the ready room at the time of attack and had to fight through the smoke and fire to reach the deck of the carrier. As the fires intensified, he had to jump 60 from the deck into the sea and was eventually picked up by destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Makigumo (1941)|Makigumo]].

After the Battle of Midway, Petty Officer Mori was transferred to the new carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'yō|''Jun'yō'']], which sailed from Japan to Guadalcanal in early October 1942. On 16 October, He participated in the hastily organized and ill-fated air strike to attack enemy position around [[Lunga Point]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. The strike consisted of 18 B5N bombers (equipped with 800 kilogram bombs) and 18 Zero fighters, under over all command of Lieutenant Commander [[Yoshio Shiga]]. [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiyō|''Hiyō'']] bombers were led by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Irikiin, while ''Jun'yō'' bombers were led by inexperienced Lieutenant Tadao Itō. As they approached Lunga Point, Itō broke off the bombing run of the entire ''Jun'yō'' group in order to make another attempt, which infuriated Mori. During the second attempt the group was ambushed by numerous Wildcat fighters from [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]. In the attack three ''Hiyō'' bombers were shot down and three were damaged, while six ''Jun'yō'' bombers were shot down and 2 were damaged. The escorting Zeros claimed several Wildcats, however ''Hiyō'' ace [[Kaname Harada]] was wounded and had to ditch at [[Rekata Bay]]. Petty Officer Mori lost his right hand and was forced to ditch his bomber in the water near [[Cape Esperance]]. He then endured starvation on [[Guadalcanal]] before being evacuated to [[Truk]] in November.

==Later life==
As a result of the injury, Mori was discharged from the navy and survived the war. He later opened a bar near [[Nishi-Ogikubo Station]] in Tokyo, where he also worked as the bartender.

The '''Gotthard Tunnel''' ({{lang-de|Gotthardtunnel}}, {{lang-fr|Tunnel du Saint-Gothard}}, {{lang-it|Galleria del San Gottardo}}, {{lang-rm|Tunnel dal Son Gottard}}), is an approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|sigfig=2|adj=mid|-long}} railway [[tunnel]] and forms the summit of the [[Gotthard Railway]] in Switzerland. It connects [[Göschenen]] with [[Airolo]] and was the first tunnel through the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif]] in order to bypass the [[St Gotthard Pass]]. It is built as one double-track, standard gauge tunnel.<ref name=saw-34>{{cite book | title = Eisenbahnatlas Schweiz | year = 2012 | publisher = Verlag Schweers + Wall GmbH | isbn=978-3-89494-130-7 | page = 34}}</ref> When opened in 1882, the Gotthard Tunnel was the longest tunnel in the world.

The tunnel rises from the northern portal at Göschenen ({{convert|1106|m|abbr=on}}) and the highest point ({{convert|1151|m|abbr=on}}) is reached after approximately {{convert|8|km}}. After two more kilometers, the border between the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] and [[Canton of Ticino|Ticino]] is passed; after another {{convert|5|km}}, the tunnel ends at the southern portal near to Airolo ({{convert|1142|m|abbr=on}}). The journey through the tunnel takes about seven to eight minutes by train. Services are operated by the [[Swiss Federal Railways]].

==Financing==
The [[Gotthard Railway Company]] was founded in 1871 under the stewardship of the Swiss industrialist [[Alfred Escher]], who had created the [[Credit Suisse|Schweizerische Kreditanstalt]] in 1856. Despite initial difficulties to finance the project, and resulting costs of about 11% over budget, the financing was shared among private and public investors from [[Switzerland]] (20M CHF), [[Italy]] (45M CHF) and the [[German Empire]] (20M CHF). The bidding war between an engineering company from [[Geneva]] and Italy was fought, and finally, the Swiss engineer [[Louis Favre]] won the project with an estimated cost of 2830 Swiss francs per meter. Because of his low bid, and the extra costs during construction, Favre increasingly found himself at odds with Swiss politicians and investors alike.<ref>Tebart A (2013). [http://www.ingenieur.de/Panorama/Am-Rande/Tunnelblick-150-Jahre-St-Gotthard Tunnelblick: 150 Jahre St. Gotthard] ''Ingenieur.de (Technikgeschichte)''. Retrieved January 19, 2015.</ref>

==Construction==
The tunnel was built from 1872 to 1881 and marked the first large-scale use of [[dynamite]] which had been patented in 1867. Construction was supervised by the Swiss engineer [[Louis Favre]], who suffered a fatal heart attack inside the tunnel in 1879. Construction was difficult due to financial, technical and geological issues, the latter of which led to the death of around 200 workers (the exact number is not known) mainly due to water inrushes; many were also killed by the [[Compressed-air vehicle|compressed air-driven trains]] carrying excavated material out of the tunnel. There were also serious health issues caused by an epidemic of [[hookworm]] infection (''[[Ancylostoma duodenale]]'').<ref>E. Bugnion, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2263460 \"On the epidemic caused by Ankylostomum among the workmen in the St. Gothard Tunnel\"], ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', volume 1, page 382, 1881.</ref><ref name=Peduzzi/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924014533818/cu31924014533818_djvu.txt Bibliography of Hookworm Disease]</ref> Medical investigations led to \"major advances in [[parasitology]], by way of research into the aetiology, epidemiology and treatment of [[ancylostomiasis]]\".<ref name=Peduzzi>R.

A memorial for the dead workers was erected in 1932 near the station building at Airolo. The memorial contains a relief by [[Vincenzo Vela]] from 1882/1883, titled \"Vittime del lavoro\" (Victims of labour).

==Operation==
[[File:Grafischer Fahrplan 1899.jpg|thumb|Timetable of Gotthard Railway showing the traffic leading through the tunnel in 1899]]
The tunnel was opened for traffic in 1882, operated by the private railway company Gotthardbahn, which ran from [[Lucerne]] to [[Chiasso]] at the Italian border. The Gotthardbahn was integrated into the [[Swiss Federal Railways]] in 1909. In 1920, the first [[Electric locomotive|electric trains]] were run through the Gotthard Tunnel. Initially the voltage had to be reduced from the desired {{nowrap|15 kilovolts}} to {{nowrap|7.5 kV}}, because the grime deposited on the insulators by the [[steam locomotive]]s encouraged excessive [[arcing]]. However, in May the next year, steam was replaced entirely by electric traction, and the problem of soot and grime was eliminated.<ref name=\"bahndurch\">Book: \"Die Bahn durch den Gotthard\"</ref>

Until the opening of the [[Gotthard Road Tunnel]] in 1980, the Swiss Federal Railways offered [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback]] services for cars and trucks through the Gotthard Tunnel. Today, that service exists as the [[rolling highway]] from the German to the Italian border and aims to reduce truck traffic on Swiss expressways. An improvisational piggyback service from Göschenen to Airolo was offered during the two-month closure of the Gotthard Road Tunnel in 2001.

The adjacent ramps include several turn tunnels (see [[Table of turn tunnels]]). The nearby [[Gotthard Road Tunnel]] was opened in 1980.

The '''California Space Authority (CSA)''' was a nonprofit corporation representing the commercial, civil, and national defense/homeland security interests of California's diverse space enterprise community in four domains: Industry, Government, [[Academia]], and [[Workforce]].  CSA was also a participating member in the [[Coalition for Space Exploration]]. It officially ceased operations on June 10, 2011.

== Overview ==

Former schoolteacher, Assemblywoman and Congresswoman [[Andrea Seastrand]] served as the Executive Director of CSA, which was governed by a statewide board of directors, composed of twelve members elected by the CSA Membership.  Four directors were selected from each of CSA's three regions (Northern, Central, and Southern California) during elections that are held in the Fall in which each director was elected to a 3-year term.  The terms of office were staggered such that half of the seats on the board are up for election each year.  The Board would also fill additional 1-year seats with CSA members to ensure adequate representation was met across CSA's constituent types (industry, government, academia, large, small, etc.).

Designated as California's [[Spaceport]] Authority, CSA was tasked by the state of California to operate as a member-based \"enterprise\" association that worked closely with individual, corporate, state and local government and academic stakeholders throughout the state.  The main purpose of CSA was to facilitate California's competitiveness within the aerospace industry.  In this capacity, CSA was also authorized to facilitate development of California-based spaceports.

Including space-related companies, individual entrepreneurs, [[government agencies]], non-profit organizations and College and University research programs, California's space enterprise provides or supports the delivery of hundreds of space-related products and services to the state and the nation.  The total [[economic impact]] of California's space enterprise (Commercial, Civil, National Security) was estimated to be in excess of $120 billion.  Representing 24% of the global space market, California space enterprise impacts over 251,000 jobs statewide.

Some of the CSA's major responsibilities were to:<ref>{{cite web|title=California Space Authority|url=http://www.californiaspaceauthority.org/|work=Website|publisher=California Space Authority|accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref>

* Serve as the official voice of the State of California on space technology issues to the federal government, other state governments, local governments and the private sector;
* Act as the official policy advisor to the Governor and State Legislature on space-related matters;
* Link statewide resources and capital to California space and technology enterprises;
* Promote California as an international center of space technology;
* Coordinate the development of the California Strategic Space Plan, and;
* Design and administer a competitive grant program.

== History ==

The predecessor organization to the California Space Authority (CSA) was the California Space and Technology Alliance (CSTA).  The first CSA Board of Directors was seated in January 2001.

The California Space and Technology Alliance was established in 1996 as a [[501(c)(6)]] non-profit organization to foster development of space industry and was officially recognized by the state when Governor [[Pete Wilson]] signed Assembly [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] 1475 into law in October 1997.  AB 1475, co-sponsored by state Senator [[John Vasconcellos]] and Assemblymembers [[Jim Cunneen]], [[Elaine K. Alquist]] and [[Liz Figueroa]] created the CSTA ''\"to foster the development of specified activities in California related to space flight.\"'' The vision of the CSTA was that ''\"California leads the world in space education, research, technology, manufacturing, services and transportation.\"''

The bill also authorized the CSTA to function as the California Spaceport Authority (one of five spaceport authorities in the nation) and set forth the duties of the CSTA.  One such duty was to administer the Space Flight Competitive Grant Program.

Prior to enactment of AB 1475, California, which had been a leader in the space industry, did not have a coordinated, statewide voice on space issues.  By creating the CSTA, AB 1475 provided a vehicle for such a unified voice.  The CSTA served as the official policy advisor to the Governor and the Legislature on space-related matters, while acting as an advocate for the state on space technology issues (CA Government Code 15333.3).

Governed by a statewide board of directors, the space authority was a private nonprofit group whose headline members included [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Boeing]], [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Raytheon]]. However, it had managed more than $16 million in taxpayer funds since the 1990s.

Over the past decade, the group's major focus was the California Space Center, a proposed {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|adj=on|disp=flip}} complex envisioned as providing education, entertainment, cultural activities and office space just outside the only spaceport on the West Coast at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[Santa Barbara County]].

In January 2011, the CSA was within months of signing a final lease with the Air Force and breaking ground. However, just two months later in March, CSA leadership halted those plans. The space authority said it had determined the California Space Center would have had to navigate Santa Barbara County's strict environmental review process, which would have added three to five years of hearings and approvals before construction could start.<ref>{{cite news|last=Report|first=Staff|title=California Space Authority to dissolve|url=http://www.lompocrecord.com/news/local/military/vandenberg/article_2b703680-9397-11e0-8493-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=June 10, 2011|newspaper=Lompoc Record|date=June 10, 2011}}</ref> CSA had signaled its intent to move the center within the city limits of Lompoc, where city leaders welcomed the project.

On June 10, 2011, officials announced the CSA Board of Directors had agreed the previous Monday to begin the dissolution process, with members voting in favor of breaking up the organization. According to Janice Dunn, former deputy director, a lack of funding led to the decision. In the past few months, the organization learned an expected $5 million in federal money wouldn't be coming through, due in large part to the [[economic recession]].

'''Papyrus 66''' (also referred to as <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>66</sup>) is a near complete [[codex]] of the [[Gospel of John]], and part of the collection known as the [[Bodmer Papyri]].

==Description==
[[File:Papyrus 66 (GA).jpg|thumb|The first page of the papyrus, showing John 1:1-13 and the opening words of v.14]]
The manuscript contains John 1:1–6:11, 6:35b–14:26, 29–30; 15:2–26; 16:2–4, 6–7; 16:10–20:20, 22–23; 20:25–21:9, 12, 17. It is one of the oldest well-preserved [[New Testament]] [[manuscript]]s known to exist. Its original editor assigned the codex to the early third century, or around AD 200, on the basis of its style of handwriting.<ref>Victor Martin, ''Papyrus Bodmer II: Evangile de Jean chap. 1–14'' (Cologny-Geneva: Bibliotheca Bodmeriana, 1956), 15-18.</ref>  Herbert Hunger later claimed that the handwriting should be dated to an earlier period in the middle or early part of the second century.<ref>Herbert Hunger. \"Zur Datierung des Papyrus Bodmer II (P66),\" ''Anzeiger der Österreichischen Akademie
der Wissenschaften philosophisch-historische Klasse'' 97 (1961) 12–23.</ref> More recently, Brent Nongbri has produced a broader study of the codex and argued that when one takes into consideration the format, construction techniques, and provenance of the codex along with the handwriting, it is more reasonable to conclude that the codex was produced \"in the early or middle part of the fourth century.\" <ref>Brent Nongbri. \"The Limits of Palaeographic Dating of Literary Papyri: Some Observations on the Date and Provenance of P.Bodmer II (P66),\" ''Museum Helveticum'' 71 (2014), 1–35.</ref>

In common with both the other surviving early papyri of John's Gospel – [[Papyrus 45|P<sup>45</sup>]] (apparently), [[Papyrus 75|P<sup>75</sup>]], and most New Testament [[List of New Testament uncials|uncial]]s – Papyrus 66 does not include the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|pericope of the adulteress]] (7:53-8:11),<ref name=\"Comfort and Barrett\">Philip Comfort and David Barrett. ''Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek manuscripts'' (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1999.) p. 376.</ref> demonstrating the absence of this passage in all the surviving early witnesses of the [[Gospel of John]]. The manuscript also contains, consistently, the use of [[Nomina Sacra]].

Studies done by Karyn Berner<ref>Karyn Berner. ''Papyrus Bodmer II, <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>66</sup>: A re-evaluation of the Correctors and corrections'' (MA thesis, 1993)</ref> and Philip Comfort<ref>Philip W. Comfort. ''The Scribe as Interpreter: A new Look at New Testament Textual Criticism according to Reader-Reception Theory'' (1996)</ref> contended that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>66</sup> had the work of three individuals on it: the original, professional scribe, a thoroughgoing corrector, and a minor corrector.  But more recently James Royse argues that, with the possible exception of John 13:19, the corrections are all by the hand of the original copyist.<ref>Royse, pp. 409–21.</ref>

The [[staurogram]] appears in at least ten places in the papyrus (corresponding to chapter 19 of the Gospel).<ref>Hurtado, Larry W., in ''New Testament Manuscripts: Their Text and Their World'', ed. Thomas J. Kraus and Tobias Nicklas, Leiden: Brill 2006, pp. 207–226 at p. 212</ref>

In John 1:15 ο οπισω ] ο πισω, the reading is supported by [[Codex Sangallensis 48|Sangallensis]] and [[Minuscule 1646|1646]];<ref>UBS3, p. 321</ref>

It is currently housed at the Cologny-Geneva, Switzerland: Bibliotheca Bodmeriana. The Papyrus contains 39 folios – that is 78 leaves, 156 pages – at a size of 14.2&nbsp;cm x 16.2&nbsp;cm for each leaf with roughly 15-25 lines per page.

'''Papyrus 66''' (also referred to as <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>66</sup>) is a near complete [[codex]] of the [[Gospel of John]], and part of the collection known as the [[Bodmer Papyri]].

==Description==
[[File:Papyrus 66 (GA).jpg|thumb|The first page of the papyrus, showing John 1:1-13 and the opening words of v.14]]
The manuscript contains John 1:1–6:11, 6:35b–14:26, 29–30; 15:2–26; 16:2–4, 6–7; 16:10–20:20, 22–23; 20:25–21:9, 12, 17. It is one of the oldest well-preserved [[New Testament]] [[manuscript]]s known to exist. Its original editor assigned the codex to the early third century, or around AD 200, on the basis of its style of handwriting.<ref>Victor Martin, ''Papyrus Bodmer II: Evangile de Jean chap. 1–14'' (Cologny-Geneva: Bibliotheca Bodmeriana, 1956), 15-18.</ref>  Herbert Hunger later claimed that the handwriting should be dated to an earlier period in the middle or early part of the second century.<ref>Herbert Hunger. \"Zur Datierung des Papyrus Bodmer II (P66),\" ''Anzeiger der Österreichischen Akademie
der Wissenschaften philosophisch-historische Klasse'' 97 (1961) 12–23.</ref> More recently, Brent Nongbri has produced a broader study of the codex and argued that when one takes into consideration the format, construction techniques, and provenance of the codex along with the handwriting, it is more reasonable to conclude that the codex was produced \"in the early or middle part of the fourth century.\" <ref>Brent Nongbri. \"The Limits of Palaeographic Dating of Literary Papyri: Some Observations on the Date and Provenance of P.Bodmer II (P66),\" ''Museum Helveticum'' 71 (2014), 1–35.</ref>

In common with both the other surviving early papyri of John's Gospel – [[Papyrus 45|P<sup>45</sup>]] (apparently), [[Papyrus 75|P<sup>75</sup>]], and most New Testament [[List of New Testament uncials|uncial]]s – Papyrus 66 does not include the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|pericope of the adulteress]] (7:53-8:11),<ref name=\"Comfort and Barrett\">Philip Comfort and David Barrett. ''Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek manuscripts'' (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1999.) p. 376.</ref> demonstrating the absence of this passage in all the surviving early witnesses of the [[Gospel of John]]. The manuscript also contains, consistently, the use of [[Nomina Sacra]].

Studies done by Karyn Berner<ref>Karyn Berner. ''Papyrus Bodmer II, <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>66</sup>: A re-evaluation of the Correctors and corrections'' (MA thesis, 1993)</ref> and Philip Comfort<ref>Philip W. Comfort. ''The Scribe as Interpreter: A new Look at New Testament Textual Criticism according to Reader-Reception Theory'' (1996)</ref> contended that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>66</sup> had the work of three individuals on it: the original, professional scribe, a thoroughgoing corrector, and a minor corrector.  But more recently James Royse argues that, with the possible exception of John 13:19, the corrections are all by the hand of the original copyist.<ref>Royse, pp. 409–21.</ref>

The [[staurogram]] appears in at least ten places in the papyrus (corresponding to chapter 19 of the Gospel).<ref>Hurtado, Larry W., in ''New Testament Manuscripts: Their Text and Their World'', ed. Thomas J. Kraus and Tobias Nicklas, Leiden: Brill 2006, pp. 207–226 at p. 212</ref>

It was published in 1956 and it was the most important New Testament manuscript publication since the Chester Beatty Papyri in 1933–1934.<ref>Floyd V. Filson, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3209339 ''A New Papyrus Manuscript of the Gospel of John''], The Biblical Archeologist (Vol. XX), p. 54.</ref>

It is currently housed at the Cologny-Geneva, Switzerland: Bibliotheca Bodmeriana. The Papyrus contains 39 folios – that is 78 leaves, 156 pages – at a size of 14.2&nbsp;cm x 16.2&nbsp;cm for each leaf with roughly 15-25 lines per page.

==Early life==

Dhammalok (alternative names: Bhikkhu Dhammalok Mahathero, Dharmaloka) was born Das Ratna [[Tuladhar]] at [[Asan, Kathmandu|Asan]] Dhalasikwa, [[Kathmandu]] to a trading family. His father was Kesh Sundar and his mother Bekha Laxmi Tuladhar. Das Ratna engaged in business in [[Tibet]] during his early years and was known by the nickname Baran Sahu (बारां साहु).<ref>Aniruddha, Bhikshu (July 2004). ''Mahosadha Mahajataka.'' Taipei: The Corporate Body of the Buddha Educational Foundation. Page 3.</ref>

He was married to Dibya Laxmi with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Grief at the death of his wife and his association with Mahapandit [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] of India drew him towards religion.<ref>Sudarshan, Bhikshu (1970). ''Lumankebahapin'' (\"Memorable Figures\"). Kathmandu: Chwasapasa. Pages 75-84.</ref> His elder son Gaja Ratna too became a Buddhist monk, taking up the name [[Aniruddha Mahathera]].

==Imprisonment and ordination==

In 1929, Das Ratna went to Sri Lanka for religious study. Returning to Nepal, he lived at the monastery of [[Kindo Baha]] near [[Swayambhu]] where he conducted regular prayer meetings and distributed pamphlets written in Nepal Bhasa appealing for donations. On 6 November 1931, he was arrested and imprisoned for seven days as it was illegal to write in Nepal Bhasa<ref>{{cite book| last = Lienhard| first = Siegfried| title = Nevārīgītīmañjarī| year = 1992| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| isbn = 978-81-208-0963-5| page = 4 }}</ref> or propagate Buddhism. Subsequently, Das Ratna went to Rangoon, Burma (now [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]]) where he lived a year. Returning from Burma, he went to [[Kusinagar]] where he became a novice monk and took the name Dhammalok in 1933.<ref>Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). ''A Pilgrimage in China.'' Kathmandu: Bhikkhu Aniruddha Mahasthavir. Page 17.</ref>

Dhammalok returned to Kindo Baha, where he began writing a series of books in Nepal Bhasa that challenged traditional thinking. ''Lokay Kuchal Kubyabahar Sudhar'' (\"Reforming Ill Practices and Customs in Society\") and ''Dharmaya Namay Pap'' (\"Sinning in the Name of Religion\") published from [[Varanasi]], India are some of his well-known works. Dhammalok has also translated ''Buddha Charita'', a biography of the Buddha by Asva Ghosh, into Nepal Bhasa from the Sanskrit.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kloppenborg|first=Ria|title=Theravada Buddhism in Nepal|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/kailash/kailash_05_04_03.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2011|newspaper=Kailash|publisher= |date=}} Page 305.</ref> Among his notable books, the travelogue ''Mahachin Yatra'' (\"A Journey to Great China\") was published from [[Kalimpong]] in 1950.

==Into exile==

In 1943, Dhammalok established Ananda Kuti Vihar, the first Theravada monastery in modern Nepal, at Swayambhu. It became the center for the Theravada community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lumbini.org.uk/bd_n_thera_t.html|title=Theravada Buddhism in Modern Nepal|publisher=Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK)|accessdate=13 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804160554/http://www.lumbini.org.uk/bd_n_thera_t.html|archive-date=4 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The government declared that the activities of the Theravada monks of spreading Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa were illegal, and on 30 July 1944, eight monks including Dhammalok, [[Pragyananda Mahasthavir]] and [[Kumar Kashyap Mahasthavir]] were expelled from Nepal for refusing to sign a pledge to stop doing so.<ref>Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999).

==Prevalence==
According to a study on [[vagina]]l practices by the [[World Health Organization]] published in 2011, one of the ways in which women practice vaginal care is by \"Vaginal steaming or smoking: the 'steaming' or 'smoking' of the vagina, by sitting above a source of heat (fire, coals, hot rocks) on which water, herbs, or oils are placed to create steam or smoke\".<ref name=jwh/> For that study, over 4,000 women in  Tete (Mozambique), KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), Yogyakarta (Indonesia), and Chonburi (Thailand) were asked about their vaginal care. When it came to vaginal steaming/smoking, very different results were obtained, and very different reasons were given: in Chonburi, 67% of women reported having performed vaginal steaming or smoking, \"which they associated with  maintaining  wellness  and  feminine  identity\", especially after [[Postpartum period|having given birth]] (85.5%). In Tete, only 10% of women practiced steaming or smoking, \"mostly intended to enhance male sexual pleasure by causing vaginal tightening (64.1% of users) and drying (22.9%)\". In the two African locations, 37–38% of women said they practiced it to enhance \"male sexual pleasure\"; in the two Asian ones, 0% gave that answer. Conversely, of the Asian women 26% reported their \"feminine identity\" was a reason, compared to 0% of the African women.<ref name=jwh/>

analyzed \"90 online items related to vaginal steaming\", including from newspapers and magazines, blogs, and providers of the practice. They identified a general theme, that of the \"self-improving woman\", which they argue fits in perfectly with modern constructions of what scholarship has called the \"neoliberal\" woman, a woman who, free of outside influences, seeks to optimize herself and her health (see [[Healthism]]). Within that theme, they found four attitudes that promote healthist practices such as vaginal steaming:
# The female body is inherently defective and dirty, and deteriorates with age: \"the female body [is] situated within this biologically-determinist narrative of inevitable decline\" which can be resisted.{{r|VB|p=475}}
# Western medicine and bodily care (including tampon use, for instance) make the female genitalia unnaturally full of toxins, a process that can be reversed by the natural practice of vaginal steaming (the authors note that such accounts are themselves littered with language derived from Western medicine—\"symptoms\", \"decline\", \"ailments\").{{r|VB|p=476}}
# Health enhancement, and the optimization of the body, specifically fertility and sexual pleasure, with much of the language used by advertisers of spas focusing on \"maintenance\" and \"restoration\", reinforcing both healthism and the fetishization of youth; vaginal steaming, it is claimed, improves marriages and the male libido. According to the authors, \"the sexual and reproductive enhancement focus mirrors the two modes through which Western societies have traditionally valued women: sexual availability for men (within marriage) and childbearing\".{{r|VB|p=478}}
# The pampering of the self-assured woman, a luxury as well as a right that they have earned, with advertising playing on the \"reawakening\" of the \"inner goddess\": \"To awaken your inner goddess, please call us at...\" The idea is that the practice allows a woman to reach her true potential, her true self.{{r|VB|p=479}}

The authors conclude that vaginal steaming is one of many practices that fit \"neoliberal, postfeminist and healthist ideologies, colliding with pervasive sociocultural understandings of the female reproductive body both as core of womanhood and as 'embodied pathology{{'\"}}.{{r|VB|p=480}}

'''Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel''' (28 June 1736 – 1 May 1809) was a French-German writer and translator from the [[Pfeffel family]]. His texts were put to music by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. He is sometimes also known as '''Amédée''' or '''Théophile''' Conrad Pfeffel, which is the French translation of Gottlieb (\"Godlove\").

==Biography==
Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel was born in [[Colmar]].  His father, Johann Konrad Pfeffel, was the mayor of Colmar and a legal consultant of the French king, but died when Gottlieb was only two years old.  He was raised by his brother [[Christian Friedrich Pfeffel]], who was ten years older. He went in 1751 to the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]] to study Law, with the intention of becoming a diplomat. There, he was a student of the philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. In 1752, he translated [[Johann Joachim Spalding]]'s ''Gedanken über den Werth der Gefühle in dem Christenthum'' in French. In 1754, he went to Dresden for treatment of an eye problem; there, he met the poet [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]]. His eye condition deteriorated, and in 1758, after an operation, he became completely blind and had to abandon his studies.<ref name=Spiegel>{{cite web|title=Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel|url= http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/autor/460| publisher = Der Spiegel|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=Bautz>{{cite web|title=Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon|publisher=Traugott Bautz| language = German|year=2007}}</ref>

In February 1759, he married Margaretha Cleophe Divoux, a merchant's daughter from [[Strasbourg]]. They had thirteen children together, of whom 7 died before adulthood. He started to establish himself as a writer and translator.  In 1762, he translated [[Magnus Gottfried Lichtwer]]'s ''Fabeln'' in French.  He also worked on a translation into German of [[Claude Fleury]]'s ''Histoire ecclésiastique''. He opened a military academy for aristocratic Protestants in 1773, since these boys were not allowed at the military academy of Paris.  He joined the [[Helvetic Society]] in 1776, and in 1782 became a citizen of the city of [[Biel]] (Bienne) in Switzerland, and became an honorary member of the city council in 1783. The [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] made him an honorary member in 1788.<ref name=Spiegel/><ref name=Bautz/>

After the French Revolution, he lost the military academy and his fortune, and found jobs with the educational board of Colmar, with the publisher Tübingen-[[Johann Friedrich Cotta|Cotta]], and as a translator, until [[Napoleon I]] granted him an annual pension in 1806. He wrote many articles for the magazine ''Flora''. In 1808 he became an honorary member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. He died the next year.<ref name=Spiegel/><ref name=Bautz/>

His poem ''Der freie Mann'' was put to music by Ludwig van Beethoven (catalogue number [[WoO (Beethoven)|WoO]] 117) in 1794 or 1795.<ref>{{cite web|last=van Beethoven |first=Ludwig |title=Vocal Music (Stolte, Schreier, Olbertz) |url=http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/preview/catalogueinfo.asp?catID=0020842BC&path=1 |publisher=Naxos |accessdate=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008064401/http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/preview/catalogueinfo.asp?catID=0020842BC&path=1 |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}</ref> Franz Schubert made a [[lied]] of his text ''Der Vatermörder'' ([[Otto Erich Deutsch|D]]10),<ref>{{cite web|last=Schubert |first=Friedrich |title=Lied - Settings of Various Poets |edition=29 |url=http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/preview/catalogueinfo.asp?catID=8.570838&path=1 |publisher=Naxos |accessdate=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008064606/http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/preview/catalogueinfo.asp?catID=8.570838&path=1 |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}</ref> and [[Leopold Kozeluch]] put music to his [[cantata]] for the blind Austrian singer [[Maria Theresia von Paradis]].<ref>{{cite journal| title= An account of Mademoiselle Theresa Paradis| journal= [[The London Magazine]] | year= 1785| volume= 4}}</ref> In 1773, his ''Philemon und Baucis: Ein Schauspiel in Versen von einem Aufzuge'', a play in verse in one act, was turned into a [[Singspiel]] for a [[marionette]] theater by [[Joseph Haydn]] with the new title ''Philemon und Baucis oder Jupiters Reise auf die Erde'' (''Philemon and Baucis or Jupiter's Travels to the Earth'').  It was changed into a regular opera in 1776.<ref>{{cite web | title = Philemon und Baucis |url=http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/465715.html#tvf=tracks&tv=about |publisher=Classicalarchives.com |accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>

Pfeffel was a friend or acquaintance of many well-known persons of his period, including [[Voltaire]], [[Vittorio Alfieri]] and the Swiss poet [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]], which whom he corresponded for many years. In 1839, his niece [[:ru:Пфеффель, Эрнестина|Ernestine von Pfeffel]] (1810-94) married [[Fyodor Tyutchev]], one of the most famous Russian poets.

A statue of Pfeffel by [[André Friedrich]] was placed in the [[Unterlinden Museum]] in 1859, and a copy of that statue was placed on the Grand Rue in Colmar in 1927.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monument dedicated to Pfeffel|url=http://www.ot-colmar.fr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16809&Itemid=215&lang=en|publisher=Office de Tourisme de Colmar|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>

'''Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel''' (28 June 1736 – 1 May 1809) was a French-German writer and translator, whose texts were put to music by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. He is sometimes also known as '''Amédée''' or '''Théophile''' Conrad Pfeffel, which is the French translation of Gottlieb (\"Godlove\").

==Biography==
Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel was born in [[Colmar]].  His father, Johann Konrad Pfeffel, was the mayor of Colmar and a legal consultant of the French king, but died when Gottlieb was only two years old.  He was raised by his brother [[Christian Friedrich Pfeffel]], who was ten years older. He went in 1751 to the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]] to study Law, with the intention of becoming a diplomat. There, he was a student of the philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. In 1752, he translated [[Johann Joachim Spalding]]'s ''Gedanken über den Werth der Gefühle in dem Christenthum'' in French. In 1754, he went to Dresden for treatment of an eye problem; there, he met the poet [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]]. His eye condition deteriorated, and in 1758, after an operation, he became completely blind and had to abandon his studies.<ref name=Spiegel>{{cite web|title=Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel|url= http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/autor/460| publisher = Der Spiegel|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=Bautz>{{cite web|title=Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon|publisher=Traugott Bautz| language = German|year=2007}}</ref>

In February 1759, he married Margaretha Cleophe Divoux, a merchant's daughter from [[Strasbourg]]. They had thirteen children together, of whom 7 died before adulthood. He started to establish himself as a writer and translator.  In 1762, he translated [[Magnus Gottfried Lichtwer]]'s ''Fabeln'' in French.  He also worked on a translation into German of [[Claude Fleury]]'s ''Histoire ecclésiastique''. He opened a military academy for aristocratic Protestants in 1773, since these boys were not allowed at the military academy of Paris.  He joined the [[Helvetic Society]] in 1776, and in 1782 became a citizen of the city of [[Biel]] (Bienne) in Switzerland, and became an honorary member of the city council in 1783. The [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] made him an honorary member in 1788.<ref name=Spiegel/><ref name=Bautz/>

After the French Revolution, he lost the military academy and his fortune, and found jobs with the educational board of Colmar, with the publisher Tübingen-[[Johann Friedrich Cotta|Cotta]], and as a translator, until [[Napoleon I]] granted him an annual pension in 1806. He wrote many articles for the magazine ''Flora''. In 1808 he became an honorary member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. He died the next year.<ref name=Spiegel/><ref name=Bautz/>

His poem ''Der freie Mann'' was put to music by Ludwig van Beethoven (catalogue number [[WoO (Beethoven)|WoO]] 117) in 1794 or 1795.<ref>{{cite web|last=van Beethoven |first=Ludwig |title=Vocal Music (Stolte, Schreier, Olbertz) |url=http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/preview/catalogueinfo.asp?catID=0020842BC&path=1 |publisher=Naxos |accessdate=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008064401/http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/preview/catalogueinfo.asp?catID=0020842BC&path=1 |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}</ref> Franz Schubert made a [[lied]] of his text ''Der Vatermörder'' ([[Otto Erich Deutsch|D]]10),<ref>{{cite web|last=Schubert |first=Friedrich |title=Lied - Settings of Various Poets |edition=29 |url=http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/preview/catalogueinfo.asp?catID=8.570838&path=1 |publisher=Naxos |accessdate=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008064606/http://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/preview/catalogueinfo.asp?catID=8.570838&path=1 |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}</ref> and [[Leopold Kozeluch]] put music to his [[cantata]] for the blind Austrian singer [[Maria Theresia von Paradis]].<ref>{{cite journal| title= An account of Mademoiselle Theresa Paradis| journal= [[The London Magazine]] | year= 1785| volume= 4}}</ref> In 1773, his ''Philemon und Baucis: Ein Schauspiel in Versen von einem Aufzuge'', a play in verse in one act, was turned into a [[Singspiel]] for a [[marionette]] theater by [[Joseph Haydn]] with the new title ''Philemon und Baucis oder Jupiters Reise auf die Erde'' (''Philemon and Baucis or Jupiter's Travels to the Earth'').  It was changed into a regular opera in 1776.<ref>{{cite web | title = Philemon und Baucis |url=http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/465715.html#tvf=tracks&tv=about |publisher=Classicalarchives.com |accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>

Pfeffel was a friend or acquaintance of many well-known persons of his period, including [[Voltaire]], [[Vittorio Alfieri]] and the Swiss poet [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]], which whom he corresponded for many years. In 1839, his niece [[:ru:Пфеффель, Эрнестина|Ernestine von Pfeffel]] (1810-94) married [[Fyodor Tyutchev]], one of the most famous Russian poets.

A statue of Pfeffel by [[André Friedrich]] was placed in the [[Unterlinden Museum]] in 1859, and a copy of that statue was placed on the Grand Rue in Colmar in 1927.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monument dedicated to Pfeffel|url=http://www.ot-colmar.fr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16809&Itemid=215&lang=en|publisher=Office de Tourisme de Colmar|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>

'''''Come Home with Me''''' is the third [[studio album]] by [[Harlem]] rapper [[Cam'ron]], it is also his debut on [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. The album was released on May 14, 2002, by Roc-A-Fella Records, [[Diplomat Records]] and [[Def Jam Recordings]]. It served as an introduction of the Cam'ron-fronted rap group, [[The Diplomats]], to the general public. There are featured guest appearances from [[The Diplomats]], [[DJ Kay Slay]], [[Daz Dillinger]], Tiffany, [[Jay-Z]], McGruff, [[Memphis Bleek]], and [[Beanie Sigel]]. To date, it is his most commercially successful album, it peaked at number 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 226,000 copies and eventually sold over one million copies in the United States, being certified Platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1423291/ludacris-lights-up-no-1-with-red-light |title=Ludacris Lights Up No. 1 With 'Red Light' |magazine=Billboard |date=2004-12-15 |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - May 24, 2014 |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>

Its two singles were \"[[Oh Boy (Cam'ron song)|Oh Boy]]\" (featuring [[Juelz Santana]]) and \"[[Hey Ma (Cam'ron song)|Hey Ma]]\" (featuring Juelz Santana, [[Freekey Zekey]], and [[DJ Kay Slay]]). \"[[Oh Boy (Cam'ron song)|Oh Boy]]\" held the number one spot on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles for five straight weeks, the number one spot on the [[Hot Rap Tracks]] and peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second hit was \"Hey Ma\", which reached number three on the Hot 100 and number eight on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming his biggest hit. \"Daydreaming\" was a later single released in 2003 but failed to duplicate the success from his earlier singles.

[[AllMusic]]'s Jason Birchmeier praised Cam's presence throughout the record and Just Blaze supplying him with beats that strengthen him on \"Oh Boy\" and \"The Roc (Just Fire)\", concluding that \"Overall, Cam'ron couldn't return with a stronger comeback album than this: he's affiliated with one of the industry's most successful labels, graced with a hot producer, and armed with a dynamite single.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Steve 'Flash' Juon of ''RapReviews'' felt the pairing of Cam with Roc-A-Fella's team of featured artists and producers helped utilize his rap flow to its potential by crafting quality tracks with a \"slamming assembly of b-boy beats\" despite a few duds in \"Live My Life\" and the title track, concluding that \"For the beats though, and for some of Cam'Ron's best rhymes to date, ''Come Home With Me'' will be a summer anthem album for Harlemites and Roc-A-Fella Records ryders alike.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> [[Jon Caramanica]], writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', commended Cam's unique lyrical abilities but felt the stories he delivered about drugs and women were half-hearted and lacked charisma, and only partially worked when the production gave them \"the substance and emotional center they otherwise lack.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/>

The second hit was \"Hey Ma\", which reached number three on the Hot 100 and number eight on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming his biggest hit. \"Daydreaming\" was a later single released in 2003 but failed to duplicate the success from his earlier singles.

[[AllMusic]]'s Jason Birchmeier praised Cam's presence throughout the record and Just Blaze supplying him with beats that strengthen him on \"Oh Boy\" and \"The Roc (Just Fire)\", concluding that \"Overall, Cam'ron couldn't return with a stronger comeback album than this: he's affiliated with one of the industry's most successful labels, graced with a hot producer, and armed with a dynamite single.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Steve 'Flash' Juon of ''RapReviews'' felt the pairing of Cam with Roc-A-Fella's team of featured artists and producers helped utilize his rap flow to its potential by crafting quality tracks with a \"slamming assembly of b-boy beats\" despite a few duds in \"Live My Life\" and the title track, concluding that \"For the beats though, and for some of Cam'Ron's best rhymes to date, ''Come Home With Me'' will be a summer anthem album for Harlemites and Roc-A-Fella Records ryders alike.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> [[Jon Caramanica]], writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', commended Cam's unique lyrical abilities but felt the stories he delivered about drugs and women were half-hearted and lacked charisma, and only partially worked when the production gave them \"the substance and emotional center they otherwise lack.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/>

'''Pier Vellinga''' (April 17, 1950) is one of the Netherlands' experts on the impacts of [[climate change]].

==Position in 2009==

Vellinga is the chairman of the Knowledge for Climate research program and vice chairman of the Climate Changes Spatial Planning program. These programs support the Dutch government and companies with operational knowledge required for investment decisions related to [[climate change adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]]. He has a chair in Climate and Water at [[Wageningen University]] (WUR), where he is director of the Wageningen University climate program, and has a part-time chair in Societal Impacts of Climate Change at the Institute of Environmental Studies of the [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]].

==Career==

He was among the first scientists to publish on climate change and its implications regarding water and energy in the eighties. His education and training includes a Fulbright scholarship in the USA in 1967-68, an Msc (1976) and doctors degree at [[Delft University]] of Technology (1984).

His 1986 PhD on Beach Erosion and Dune Erosion During Storm provided the basis for the coastal safety evaluation (the [[Dutch Delta Plan]]).

In 1988, in a newly created position, he became advisor to the [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] on the issue of Climate Change and the development of international CO2 policies. In this role he was key negotiator during the Netherlands EU-presidency of 1988. He was also one of the experts of the [[Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases]]. For this advisory body he also chaired with [[Peter Gleick]] the “Targets and Indicators of Climatic Change” working group.

In 1991 Professor Vellinga published an article<ref>The greenhouse marathon: A proposal for a global strategy [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00142501?LI=true], Climatic Change - January 1991, Volume 18, Issue 1, pp vii-xii</ref> with Robert Swart that became a cornerstone in the definition of the 2&nbsp;°C target, than adopted by UNFCCC [[COP 15]] in Copenhagen  in 2009. This article also proposed for the first time a traffic-light visualization - based on red, yellow, green colours - that since then has been largely employed in [[risk management]] and [[climate communication|climate change communication]]. In 1991/1992 he was one of the architects of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and in 1989 was actively involved in setting up the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]] as vice chairman in its first bureau. He was as an author of various IPCC chapters (the work of the IPCC, including the contributions of many scientists, was recognised by the joint award of the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize]]).

From 1995 to 1998 he combined his work as director of the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] Amsterdam (a position which he held from 1991 to 2001) with a part-time position at the [[World Bank]], [[United Nations Environmental Program]] (UNEP) and [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) as Chairman of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) of the [[Global Environmental Facility]] (GEF). From 1991 to 2006 he has been a professor of earth sciences at the [[Vrije Universiteit]]. Joyeeta Gupta, [[Richard Tol]], Robert Swart and Hasse Goosen were among his first PhD students. He is Professor in Climate Change and Water Safety at [[Wageningen University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ess.wur.nl/NR/rdonlyres/161D7EEC-5EC4-4C4D-8941-7553FE72353C/110377/MiniCVVellinga.pdf |title=Mini CV Pier Vellinga |publisher=[[Wageningen University]] |accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>

In 2009 he initiated the international Delta Alliance, a collaboration among low-lying coastal areas in the world vulnerable to climate change. This initiative is still going on.

==Other activities==

In 2003 he presented the Erasmus Liga Lecture on Climate Change and the safety of the Netherlands. This triggered national debate on the vulnerability of the Netherlands with regard to flooding and the need to update the Delta Plan. He was advisor to the second Delta Committee (2008) on [[sea level rise]] and [[coastal protection]].

He is a member of the “Uffizio di Piano”, a high level committee of scientists and policy makers charged by the Italian prime minister to supervise the high water protection and lagoon rehabilitation works in Venice. He is also a member of the supervisory board of the FMO-Bank (finance and development)

At a national level he is chairman of the board of the Royal Dutch Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) and a member of the Energy Transition - Creative Energy platform. Lastly he is a member of the board of [[Urgenda]].

Pier Vellinga gives many lectures in the field of climate change and related energy and water issues. He has published 18 scientific papers, of which the citations add up to an [[h-index]] of 5.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In addition, he has more than 100 articles as author or co-author in books, scientific reports and proceedings of a more general nature. He has frequently appeared in news media and participated in several interviews and scientific documentaries made by national and international broadcasting cooperation's including BBC, ABC, CNN and Discovery. In August 2009, the Dutch weekly Elsevier choose him as the no. 1 climate alarmist of the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resource.wur.nl/wetenschap/detail/vellinga_niet_blij_met_titel_alarmist/ |title=<nowiki>Vellinga niet blij met title 'alarmist' [Vellinga not happy with 'alarmist' title]</nowiki> |work=Resource |language=Dutch |date=27 August 2009 |publisher=[[Wageningen University]]|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>

==Views on Climate Change==
Vellinga's views on climate change are set out in his SID-lecture from 2008 and his 2008 inaugural lecture \"Hoogtij in de Delta\" at Wageningen UR.

Kobra Khan is a fictional character in the [[Masters of the Universe]] franchise. Kobra Khan is a member of the [[The Snake Men (Masters of The Universe)|Snakemen]] and soldier in [[King Hiss]]'s army.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rbmvDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA421&dq=kobra+khan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwicn_O7kuToAhUBTxUIHbxMC4AQ6AEIOjAC#v=onepage&q=kobra+khan&f=false|title=He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: A Character Guide and World Compendium Volume 1|date=May 23, 2017|publisher=Dark Horse Comics|via=Google Books}}</ref> He is a member of the Evil Warriors, and a cross between a man and a [[cobra]], who has the power to spray a 'sleep mist' from his hood which immediately renders his opponent unconscious (in some later incarnations he instead sprays poisonous venom). Although generally recognized as a member of [[Skeletor]]'s Evil Warriors, in many media he serves a dual allegiance to both Skeletor and the later introduced [[King Hiss]] of the [[Snake Men (Masters of the Universe)|Snake Men]].

==Character history==
===Original figure===
Kobra Khan was introduced into the [[Masters of the Universe]] toy line in 1984, as part of the line's third wave of figures. 
The figure's special feature is to spray [[water]]. The figure's [[head]] is removable and the hollow [[torso]] can be filled with water, so that when the head is back in place, it can be pushed down to spray water from its [[mouth]]. The figure came with an orange version of the laser pistol that first came with the [[Zodac]] figure. 

The figure was originally released with the tag-line \"Evil Master of Snakes\". Later on in the line, when the [[The Snake Men (Masters of The Universe)|Snake Men]] were introduced, later releases of Kobra Khan packaged him with the Snake Men logo, changing his tag to \"Evil Snake Men Henchman\". He was generally portrayed as a go-between between Skeletor and King Hiss. His exact loyalties sometimes varied in different versions of the franchise, but generally he was portrayed as being more aligned to Skeletor's warriors (although changing sides as it suited him). 

===Filmation animated series===
As with a number of third wave figures, Kobra Khan is incorporated into the accomanying [[Filmation]] [[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe|cartoon]] when it returned for a second season. Whereas many of the Evil Warriors were portrayed as bumbling henchmen in the Filmation version, Kobra Khan is generally portrayed in a darker, more serious manner. 

He is usually paired with [[Webstor]] (another third wave figure introduced into the cartoon series around the same time) and the two of them are often seen to work as a duo. They are first paired in the episode \"Disappearing Dragons\" which portrays Khan as the leader of the two. He is portrayed as a sly, scheming and sullen character, capable of taking on numerous opponents at once with his sleep mist. [[Lou Scheimer]] voiced him with a low, whisper-like, hissing [[human voice|voice]]. 

In the episode \"The Good Shall Survive\" he demonstrates the power to elongate his arms to grasp his opponent before spraying them. This ability was never mentioned before nor since, be it in the Filmation cartoon or in any other incarnation of the franchise, although to note is that a later Snake Man character, [[Sssqueeze]], had stretchable arms with which he trapped victims. Although the Snake Men were produced by Mattel too late to appear in the cartoon series (although a couple were later adapted as members of [[Evil Horde|The Horde]] for the spin-off series ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]''), it is possible that the producers of the ''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' cartoon were aware of the forthcoming Sssqueeze figure and adapted the ability for Kobra Khan.

The final produced episode of the series, \"The Cold Zone\", focuses exclusively on Kobra Khan and his race, the Reptons. We learn in this episode that the Reptons inhabit a quiet underground [[monarchy|kingdom]] beneath a [[rock (geology)|stone]] [[pyramid]], and are a peaceful race who regard Khan as a [[traitor]] since he left them to join Skeletor's forces. The plot features Khan seeking the help of [[He-Man]] and his companions in relighting the [[furnace]] that heats the Reptons' kingdom, which has been extinguished by an unknown intruder. As the plot unfolds, it turns out that it was in fact Khan who extinguished the flame, and the Repton's ruler, King Pythos, has offered to grant the [[monarchy|crown]] of the Reptons to whoever can expose the guilty party. Therefore, Khan has concocted an elaborate scheme to frame He-Man for the crime so that he can become ruler of the Reptons upon exposing He-Man as guilty. 

Other members of the Reptons seen in this episode are King Pythos, an unnamed Chancellor, and the court jester, Scales, who reveals Khan as the true [[criminal]]. Althoguh this episode was made before the idea of the Snake Men was conceived by [[Mattel]], it can arguably be considered that the Reptons are a sub-division of the Snake Men who were permitted to remain on [[Eternia]] after defecting from the side of King Hiss.

===2002 series===

Kobra Khan was re-used in the 2002 relaunch of the Masters of the Universe toy line and cartoon series. A major change to his character is that his fangs spit acidic [[Venom (poison)|venom]] instead of sleep mist, and his figure was packaged as 'Venom Spitting Khan'. Khan seems able to vary the intensity of his venom as he sees fit; from a painful [[Irritation|irritant]], blinding opponents eyes without inflicting permanent damage, to a powerful [[acid]] that is able to instantly melt metal.

He is introduced in the episode \"Snake Pit\", in which he is presented as a dangerous criminal who escapes from the Royal Palace [[dungeon]]s after years of [[imprisonment]]. He flees to [[Snake Mountain (Masters of the Universe)|Snake Mountain]] where he pledges allegiance to Skeletor, but his real plan is to delve deep beneath Snake Mountain to find the Snake Pit, the portal to the void in which his [[ancestor]]s, King Hiss and the Snake Men, are imprisoned. His scheme is foiled by He-Man and Zodak before he can succeed, but he does manage to free General [[Rattlor]], and the two of them resurface in the final episode of the show's first season, \"Council of Evil\" Part 2 in which Khan makes a deal with [[Evil-Lyn]] that he will free her and the other Evil Warriors from the Masters' jail providing she assists him and Rattlor in freeing King Hiss. She keeps her part of the bargain, and in the episode \"Rise of the Snake Men part 1\" the Snake Men are finally released. While Khan is accepted by the Snake Men in their new conquest of Eternia, he is constantly treated with contempt by the leaders, purely because he is a [[kinship|descendant]] and not one of their original army, and also because of his smaller size. King Hiss however does seem to take a shine to Khan and seems to be quite impressed by his loyalty. 

Khan's personality is largely different from his 1980s incarnation. Although he still retains a portion of his independent and scheming nature, he is presented with a more youthful personality. Khan is also rather squeamish, especially at the thought of eating victims whole like the other Snake Men, and acts like a groveling bootlicker to King Hiss, doing his best to win favor in his King's eyes and outdo his rival, General Rattlor.

Nonetheless, Khan appears to be a better fighter than Rattlor against the cosmic warrior, Zodak. While Rattlor is easily defeated by Zodak, Khan swiftly overpowers the cosmic warrior. Also in the episode \"Snake Pit\" he proves himself an extremely effective fighter against He-Man and the Masters.

''The Bravery'' garnered positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s who praised their interpretation of the new wave revival movement. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 66, based on 24 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>

Steve Sutherland of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' gave high praise to the new wave revivalist production and the band's musicianship resembling that of their inspirations, in terms of vocals and instrumentals, concluding that, \"This album is already one of the debuts of the year. All hail The Bravery and their new bold dream.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/> MacKenzie Wilson of [[AllMusic]] praised the band for taking their influences and making them their own with catchability and upbeat optimism, saying that, \"''The Bravery'' isn't sonically mind-blowing, but the new millennium new wave revival remains intriguing. This New York five-piece makes an interesting effort without it coming off contrived and dishonest.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>

While finding Endicott's vocal delivery mediocre at best, Nicholas Taylor of ''[[PopMatters]]'' praised the danceable production and devil-may-care lyrics for giving the band a nice platform to start from, concluding with, \"This debut is certainly promising, and I look forward to seeing whether the Bravery can begin to carve out a more concrete and distinctive image and place for themselves.\"<ref name=\"PM\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] graded the album as a \"dud\",<ref name=\"Christgau\"/> indicating \"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|year=2000|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php|title=Key to Icons|website=RobertChristgau.com|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' writer Adam Moerder criticized the band's unremarkable take on '80s new wave with lacklustre instrumentals and Endicott's vocals sounding too close to [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] and [[Simon Le Bon]]. He gave praise to the tracks \"An Honest Mistake\" and \"Tyrant\" for their intricacies in terms of synth and vocal choices, concluding that \"Despite these highlights, though, this is still rock made on an assembly line— predictable, economically efficient, and about as dynamic as a Model T.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>

''The Bravery'' garnered positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s who praised their interpretation of the new wave revival movement. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 66, based on 24 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>

Steve Sutherland of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' gave high praise to the new wave revivalist production and the band's musicianship resembling that of their inspirations, in terms of vocals and instrumentals, concluding that, \"This album is already one of the debuts of the year. All hail The Bravery and their new bold dream.\"<ref name=\"Uncut\"/> MacKenzie Wilson of [[AllMusic]] praised the band for taking their influences and making them their own with catchability and upbeat optimism, saying that, \"''The Bravery'' isn't sonically mind-blowing, but the new millennium new wave revival remains intriguing. This New York five-piece makes an interesting effort without it coming off contrived and dishonest.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>

While finding Endicott's vocal delivery mediocre at best, Nicholas Taylor of ''[[PopMatters]]'' praised the danceable production and devil-may-care lyrics for giving the band a nice platform to start from, concluding with, \"This debut is certainly promising, and I look forward to seeing whether the Bravery can begin to carve out a more concrete and distinctive image and place for themselves.\"<ref name=\"PM\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] graded the album as a \"dud\",<ref name=\"Christgau\"/> indicating \"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|year=2000|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php|title=Key to Icons|website=RobertChristgau.com|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' writer Adam Moerder criticized the band's unremarkable take on '80s new wave with lacklustre instrumentals and Endicott's vocals sounding too close to [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] and [[Simon Le Bon]]. He gave praise to the tracks \"An Honest Mistake\" and \"Tyrant\" for their intricacies in terms of synth and vocal choices, concluding that \"Despite these highlights, though, this is still rock made on an assembly line— predictable, economically efficient, and about as dynamic as a Model T.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>

'''Alberta Christine Williams King''' (September 13, 1904&nbsp;– June 30, 1974) was [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s mother and the wife of [[Martin Luther King, Sr.]] She played a significant role in the affairs of the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site|Ebenezer Baptist Church]].

==Life and career==
[[File:King elkins at ebeneezer 1962.png|left|thumb|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (left), [[Henry Elkins]] (centered), and Alberta Williams King (right) at Ebeneezer in 1962.]]
Alberta Christine Williams was born on September 13, 1904, to Reverend Adam Daniel Williams, at the time preacher of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, and Jennie Celeste (Parks) Williams.<ref>[http://www.wargs.com/other/kingml.html Ancestry of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Alberta Williams graduated from high school at the [[Spelman Seminary]], and earned a teaching certificate at the [[Hampton University |Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute]] (now [[Hampton University]]) in 1924.

Williams met Martin L. King (then known as Michael King), whose sister Woodie was boarding with her parents, shortly before she left for Hampton. After graduating, she announced her engagement to King at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. She taught for a short time before their [[Thanksgiving]] Day 1926 wedding, but she had to quit because married female teachers were not then allowed.

Their first child, daughter [[Willie Christine King]], was born on September 11, 1927. Michael Luther King Jr. followed on January 15, 1929, then [[Alfred Daniel Williams King|Alfred Daniel Williams King I]], named after his grandfather, on July 30, 1930. About this time, Michael King changed his name to [[Martin Luther King, Sr.]]

Alberta King worked hard to instil self-respect into her children. In an essay he wrote at [[Crozer Theological Seminary |Crozer Seminary]], Martin Luther King Jr., who was always close to her, wrote that she \"was behind the scenes setting forth those motherly cares, the lack of which leaves a missing link in life.\"

Alberta King's mother died on May 18, 1941, of a [[heart attack]]. The King family later moved to a large yellow brick house three blocks away. Alberta would serve as the organizer and president of the Ebenezer Women's Committee from 1950 to 1962. She was also a talented musician who served as the choir organist and director at Ebenezer, which may have contributed to the respect her son had for the music.<ref>Lewis V. Baldwin, The Voice of Conscience: The Church in the Mind of Martin Luther King, Jr (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010, 27)</ref>  By the end of this period, Martin Luther King Sr. and Jr. were joint pastors of the church.

==Family tragedies, 1968–1974==
Martin Luther King, Jr. was [[Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination|assassinated]] on April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of the [[Lorraine Motel]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. King was in Memphis to lead a march in support of the local sanitation workers' union. He was pronounced dead one hour later. Mrs. King, a source of strength after her son's assassination, faced fresh tragedy the next year when her younger son and last-born child, [[Alfred Daniel Williams King]], who had become the assistant pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, drowned in his pool.

==Assassination==
Alberta King was shot and killed on June 30, 1974, at age 69, by Marcus Wayne Chenault, a 23-year-old black man from Ohio who had adopted an extremist version of the theology of the [[Black Hebrew Israelites]].<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=24581284&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjg0NjA1MzMzLCJpYXQiOjE1NzU0ODE1NjcsImV4cCI6MTU3NTU2Nzk2N30.-OSDmCOtOwJCJeJZByA_mqnuANSalZHgJX4uMMYyhFc \"Slaying of Mrs. Martin Luther King Sr.\" The Decatur Daily Review, July 3, 1974, p.6]</ref> Chenault's mentor, Rev. Hananiah E. Israel of Cincinnati, castigated black civil rights activists and black church leaders as being evil and deceptive, but claimed in interviews not to have advocated violence.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=24634518&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjQwNTI1NTA2OCwiaWF0IjoxNTc1NTAxODI2LCJleHAiOjE1NzU1ODgyMjZ9.gZo4ijmrOUX1sbmioKPTJ5457j5oMenExhht0BBBeYY \"I Gave Marcus the Key\" Dayton Daily News, July 3, 1974, pp.1, 15]</ref> Chenault did not draw any such distinction, and actually first decided to assassinate Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]] in Chicago, but canceled the plan at the last minute. Two weeks later he set out for Atlanta, where he shot Alberta King with two handguns as she sat at the organ of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Chenault said that he shot King because \"all Christians are my enemies,\" and claimed that he had decided that black ministers were a menace to black people. He said his original target had been Martin Luther King, Sr., but he had decided to shoot his wife instead because she was near him. He also killed one of the church's deacons, Edward Boykin, in the attack, and wounded another woman. 

===Assassin's conviction===
Chenault was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The sentence was upheld on appeal, but he was later resentenced to life in prison, partially as a result of the King family's opposition to the [[death penalty in the United States|death penalty]]. On August 3, 1995, he suffered a stroke, and was taken to a hospital, where he died at age 44 of complications from his stroke on August 19.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002766432_jdl29.html ''The Seattle Times'': Living: Martin King 3rd: living up to society's expectations<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|title=M.

==Burial==
Alberta King was interred at the South View Cemetery in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Martin Luther King, Sr., died of a heart attack on November 11, 1984, at age 84 and was interred next to her.

'''Blomberg''' is a town in the [[Lippe]] district of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], with c. 15,200 inhabitants (2018).

== Geography ==
Blomberg is 45&nbsp;km south east of [[Bielefeld]], 20&nbsp;km east of [[Detmold]] and 17&nbsp;km south west towards [[Bad Pyrmont]]. The district is located in the southern foothills of the Lippe mountain range and in the area of Blomberger and Schwalenberger Heights.

The core city is located in the center of the so-called Blomberger basin, which lies about 150 m above sea level and clearly separates itself from the surrounding area. The hem of the basin to the north and east are the approximately 400 m high wooded ridges of Barntruper and Blomberger Stadtwald with the Dicker, Becker and Winterberg. To the west are the Hörntruper Berg, the Meierberg, the Mossenberg (228 m) and the Püllenberg (261 m), while the border in the south of Nessenberg (235 m), Spielberg (239 m) and Steinberg (342 m) is formed. The drainage of the eastern part of the Blomberger basin is made by the Diestel, a left tributary of the Emmer. Between the districts Istrup and Großenmarpe a watershed has formed. For this reason, the western part of the Blomberg basin is drained via the Marpe and its tributaries towards Bega / Werre. The lowest point of the municipality is at 139 m, the highest is the summit of the winter mountain at 429 m.

== Geology ==
The municipality is located on the southern flank of the Pyrmont-Piesberger axis, there are almost exclusively rocks of the Middle (Km) and Upper Keupers (Ko) open-minded. The rock strata, which were once stored horizontally in the Middle Ages, were raised in the Tertiary around 30 million years ago and formed the Blomberger Sattel.

By erosion in the center of the saddle the older gray and red marl of the Middle Keuper (Km1) were uncovered, which is also called Gipskeuper because of switched-on layers of gypsum. The result was the clearly recognizable pelvic structure, this phenomenon is called relief reversal. The reed sandstone (Km2) then forms a first striking terrain level. The city itself is located on the western edge of this steep step. The reed sandstone was obtained in small quarries as quarry stone for construction purposes. The marls of the so-called Red Wall (Km3) are susceptible to weathering, only the following harder stone marls (Km4) give rise to another stage in the terrain. The outermost edge of the basin structure consists of harder rock layers of the Upper Keuper (Ko) Rätkeuper.

In the Tertiary it came in the inner basin edges consisting of gypsum Keuper to the dissolution of plaster layers. Through this process, also called subrosion, formed hollows. These were backfilled with the weathering marls from the immediate area. Because of their high clay content, these sediments formed the raw material basis for some brickworks. In the basin itself, loess has deposited in the course of the last ice age and weathered to loess clay. The amount of deposits is up to 150&nbsp;cm and is responsible for the good to very good quality of arable land.

The old Kleinstadt, classified district, covers an area of 99.12&nbsp;km². The municipality has a maximum extent in east-west direction of about 12½ km and in north-south direction of about 15½ km.

The vast majority of the land is used by agriculture, in the area of wet creek lowlands mainly as grassland and pastures. The forest on the surrounding mountains consists of three quarters of deciduous trees, mostly beech, while on the Rätkeuper spruce cultures thrive. In comparison to the NRW state average of 49.4%, the agricultural area in Blomberg is 60%, while the forest area is 25.4% (NRW) and 26.5% (Blomberg).

Extensive areas of the Blomberg urban area are good to very good for the use of geothermal heat sources using geothermal probes and heat generated by heat pump. In the central and southern urban area, however, the suitability is rather mediocre, and in some cases poor (see the adjacent map).

'''Blomberg''' is a town in the [[Lippe]] district of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], with c. 15,300 inhabitants (2013)

== Geography ==
Blomberg is 45&nbsp;km south east of [[Bielefeld]], 20&nbsp;km east of [[Detmold]] and 17&nbsp;km south west towards [[Bad Pyrmont]]. The district is located in the southern foothills of the Lippe mountain range and in the area of Blomberger and Schwalenberger Heights.

The core city is located in the center of the so-called Blomberger basin, which lies about 150 m above sea level and clearly separates itself from the surrounding area. The hem of the basin to the north and east are the approximately 400 m high wooded ridges of Barntruper and Blomberger Stadtwald with the Dicker, Becker and Winterberg. To the west are the Hörntruper Berg, the Meierberg, the Mossenberg (228 m) and the Püllenberg (261 m), while the border in the south of Nessenberg (235 m), Spielberg (239 m) and Steinberg (342 m) is formed. The drainage of the eastern part of the Blomberger basin is made by the Diestel, a left tributary of the Emmer. Between the districts Istrup and Großenmarpe a watershed has formed. For this reason, the western part of the Blomberg basin is drained via the Marpe and its tributaries towards Bega / Werre. The lowest point of the municipality is at 139 m, the highest is the summit of the winter mountain at 429 m.

== Geology ==
The municipality is located on the southern flank of the Pyrmont-Piesberger axis, there are almost exclusively rocks of the Middle (Km) and Upper Keupers (Ko) open-minded. The rock strata, which were once stored horizontally in the Middle Ages, were raised in the Tertiary around 30 million years ago and formed the Blomberger Sattel.

By erosion in the center of the saddle the older gray and red marl of the Middle Keuper (Km1) were uncovered, which is also called Gipskeuper because of switched-on layers of gypsum. The result was the clearly recognizable pelvic structure, this phenomenon is called relief reversal. The reed sandstone (Km2) then forms a first striking terrain level. The city itself is located on the western edge of this steep step. The reed sandstone was obtained in small quarries as quarry stone for construction purposes. The marls of the so-called Red Wall (Km3) are susceptible to weathering, only the following harder stone marls (Km4) give rise to another stage in the terrain. The outermost edge of the basin structure consists of harder rock layers of the Upper Keuper (Ko) Rätkeuper.

In the Tertiary it came in the inner basin edges consisting of gypsum Keuper to the dissolution of plaster layers. Through this process, also called subrosion, formed hollows. These were backfilled with the weathering marls from the immediate area. Because of their high clay content, these sediments formed the raw material basis for some brickworks. In the basin itself, loess has deposited in the course of the last ice age and weathered to loess clay. The amount of deposits is up to 150&nbsp;cm and is responsible for the good to very good quality of arable land.

The old Kleinstadt, classified district, covers an area of 99.12&nbsp;km². The municipality has a maximum extent in east-west direction of about 12½ km and in north-south direction of about 15½ km.

The vast majority of the land is used by agriculture, in the area of wet creek lowlands mainly as grassland and pastures. The forest on the surrounding mountains consists of three quarters of deciduous trees, mostly beech, while on the Rätkeuper spruce cultures thrive. In comparison to the NRW state average of 49.4%, the agricultural area in Blomberg is 60%, while the forest area is 25.4% (NRW) and 26.5% (Blomberg).

Extensive areas of the Blomberg urban area are good to very good for the use of geothermal heat sources using geothermal probes and heat generated by heat pump. In the central and southern urban area, however, the suitability is rather mediocre, and in some cases poor (see the adjacent map).

== Biography==
'''Christina Knight''' was born in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] to a British father, Michael Knight and a Swedish mother, Eva Knight, born Hansen.

She studied Natural sciences in Sweden and then moved to the UK to attend the [[University of Sussex]], near Brighton. She graduated from Sussex with a 2:1 Bachelor of Arts Honour's degree in American studies: Literature and film. Her studies also included a year at the [[[[University of California, San Diego]]]], where she also studied Spanish and Women's Studies. From 1983 to 1985, Christina Knight was a Sales Director at EF Language Schools in Stockholm, before starting her studies at [https://www.berghs.se/ Berghs School of Communication] where she graduated in 1986 as Copywrite Student of the Year. After reading ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' by [[John Steinbeck]] when she was sixteen years old she was inspired to become a copywriter.<ref name=\"marcommnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://marcommnews.com/marcomms-star-parade-meet-christina-knight/|title=MarComm’s Star Parade: Meet Christina Knight – Marketing Communication News|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>

Her first job as a Copywriter was at the then renowned Swedish agency, {{ill|Hall & Cederquist|sv|Hall_%26_Cederquist|vertical-align=sup}}, later acquired by [[Young & Rubicam]]. Christina worked at Hall & Cederquist as the agency's first female creative ever and stayed until 1991, when she founded her own agency, [[Knight & Day]] in Stockholm together with the Art Director, Helena Sundelin. The agency ran successfully for nine years before the owners decided to fold and Christina proceeded to freelance as a Copywriter.

Consequently, she has worked at Discovery in London and at several agencies; Trampolin, DRAFT/FCB, Lowe Brindfors, [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]] and [[INGO]] - Ogilvy & Grey in Stockholm, Sweden; between the years 1985-2004 as a Copywriter and since 2004 as a Creative Director, one of the rare female CD:s in the industry. In 2005, while working at [[DraftFCB]] Stockholm, Knight won a Lion at the Cannes Lions Advertising Award Festival for her work on a campaign called “Hello Period” which was a tampon ad campaign aimed at educating young girls about periods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/directmarketing/tampons-and-information-on-menstruation-hello-period-6061505/|title=coloribus.com Ad Archives \"HELLO, PERIOD! Tampons And Information On Menstruation\"|date=March 10, 2018|website=coloribus.com}}</ref> She has won several domestic and international advertising awards and been a jury member of most advertising award juries around the world.

=== ''Mad Women'' ===
On March 8 of 2013, on International Women's Day, Her book \"[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17735532-mad-women Mad Women] - A ''Herstory'' of Advertising\" (OLIKA) was published out of Christina's personal frustration over the ad industry's lack of women, especially in creatives and leading positions. The book features stories from and about prominent female leaders in the advertising industry such as [[Rochelle Lazarus|Shelly Lazarus]], [[Cilla Snowball]], [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], Susan Hoffman, Nunu Ntshingila, Stefanie Wurst, and several others. With 10 American ad women and 4 women from around the world, the book hosts a diverse cast of potential role models.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://madwomen.info/thebook|title=MadWoman Book Info|date=March 10, 2018}}</ref> As a consequence, Christina has lectured all over the world about the importance of balance and diversity for the communications industry. In 2015, she left her position as Creative Director at INGO to found her own company, UKNIGHT, to fully focus on supporting the industry's development into a more representative and diverse industry. She works as a Copywriter and Creative Director as well as a consultant in the industry, lectures and also teaches at Berghs School of Communication in Stockholm, among other media schools. She is also a member of the board of WaterAid Sweden, of Fredrika Bremer Förbundet and the [[International Alliance of Women]].

With Christina Knight going on to lecture about women and marketing she has even spoke as a TEDxSSE speaker in April 2014. She spoke from experience, talking about how awkward it was for her to campaign women sanitary protection to men in a client meeting. She gives us a look into the marketing field that is prominently men, because in her own words only 3% of creative directors are women in the U.S.A. She spoke about the term 'the pink ghetto', a term that was coined in 1983 to described the portion of the labor market that is predominantly female professions. But in the advertising industry, the term is used more for when the women who are in the field are placed in areas where it is deemed as typically female, example is Christina Knights campaigning for women's sanitary protection, although she was able to get herself in other assignments such as telecom, cars and ventilation technology. Throughout her talk, she makes a point that there has been a lack of women. There were few women to look up to in that industry, and she has traveled to find women in the field to show the younger generations more role models. In her own words and findings she shows a list of percentages during her talk, Women account for 80% of all consumer purchases, 55% of all home electronic purchases, 89% of all financial purchases, 92% of all holiday trips decisions, and 90% of all care purchases (by influence). She shows this because she was making the point that in the advertising industry, if women are not being brought to the forefront in this field could be a lost in money. That marketing to women could be beneficial, but that doesn't mean just make it pink.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.adwomen.org/2009/05/interview-to-christina-knight/|title=Interview to Christina Knight – Clio 2009 jury member {{!}} AdWomen|website=www.adwomen.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-09}}</ref>

Her arguments are not about having more women, or having women take control of the workforce, but rather to have more equality in men dominated field so that there would be more balance. She believed with more equality comes more perspectives. In her interview for AdWomen in 2009, when the prospect of there ever being a segregation between whats being marketed for women and what's being marketed for men, she completely disagreed with that line of thinking. She argues that you need more women, not a separation. Even when something is more for women or more for men, in her experience, both sides listen but the difference is that both sides have different experiences and with that, opinions as well of course. So when a product that is more towards one gender is being made, then it could be easier to target that gender more successfully. When asked about how to target women and key factors to reached them, she denied there being a definite answer because that would generalize them. She spoke about role models and there importance to younger generations. How that while she was still in school she didn't have any female teachers. So she's made it a point to write about an essay on the subject and has become a role model herself as she holds lectures in that school now that she has rose the ranks herself to inspire the women there now because she acknowledges that there are talented men and women.<ref name=\":0\" />

<blockquote>''\"When I lecture I always get questions on what it is like to be a woman in advertising and how I have been able to stay on for so long. Young women who I mentor ask me where they can find the experiences and stories of advertising women. It is obvious that there is a lack of visible, inspiring women role models. The time was quite simply right for this book.” - Christina Knight (2013)''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://madwomen.info/|title=Mad Women – A Herstory of Advertising|date=March 10, 2018|website=madwomen.info/|access-date=March 10, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

In a GoSee interview, she stated that her book, Mad Women, was a prominently women centered publication it didn't mean that she didn't want men to read it. Why, the opposite is true, she hoped that men would read it and that a conversation could happened so that balance could be achieved that could better represent society today. With her book, she traveled to different parts of the world to find more women in the industry and interviewed them about their experience because that was the one thing these women had in common. The goal of the book was to share their stories, give advice to help improve the industry, but predominantly provide role models for up and coming ad women.

After ''Mad Women'', Knight left to start her own business, ''UKnight'', with the intention to work more focused on changing the structures and norms of society<ref name=\"marcommnews.com\"/>

== Biography==
'''Christina Knight''' was born in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] to a British father, Michael Knight and a Swedish mother, Eva Knight, born Hansen.

She studied Natural sciences in Sweden and then moved to the UK to attend the [[University of Sussex]], near Brighton. She graduated from Sussex with a 2:1 Bachelor of Arts Honour's degree in American studies: Literature and film. Her studies also included a year at the [[[[University of California, San Diego]]]], where she also studied Spanish and Women's Studies. From 1983 to 1985, Christina Knight was a Sales Director at EF Language Schools in Stockholm, before starting her studies at [https://www.berghs.se/ Berghs School of Communication] where she graduated in 1986 as Copywrite Student of the Year. After reading the''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' by [[John Steinbeck]] when she was sixteen years old she was inspired to become a copywriter.<ref name=\"marcommnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://marcommnews.com/marcomms-star-parade-meet-christina-knight/|title=MarComm’s Star Parade: Meet Christina Knight – Marketing Communication News|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>

Her first job as a Copywriter was at the then renowned Swedish agency, {{ill|Hall & Cederquist|sv|Hall_%26_Cederquist|vertical-align=sup}}, later acquired by [[Young & Rubicam]]. Christina worked at Hall & Cederquist as the agency's first female creative ever and stayed until 1991, when she founded her own agency, [[Knight & Day]] in Stockholm together with the Art Director, Helena Sundelin. The agency ran successfully for nine years before the owners decided to fold and Christina proceeded to freelance as a Copywriter.

Consequently, she has worked at Discovery in London and at several agencies; Trampolin, DRAFT/FCB, Lowe Brindfors, [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]] and [[INGO]] - Ogilvy & Grey in Stockholm, Sweden; between the years 1985-2004 as a Copywriter and since 2004 as a Creative Director, one of the rare female CD:s in the industry. In 2005, while working at [[DraftFCB]] Stockholm, Knight won a Lion at the Cannes Lions Advertising Award Festival for her work on a campaign called “Hello Period” which was a tampon ad campaign aimed at educating young girls about periods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/directmarketing/tampons-and-information-on-menstruation-hello-period-6061505/|title=coloribus.com Ad Archives \"HELLO, PERIOD! Tampons And Information On Menstruation\"|date=March 10, 2018|website=coloribus.com}}</ref> She has won several domestic and international advertising awards and been a jury member of most advertising award juries around the world.

=== ''Mad Women'' ===
On March 8 of 2013, on International Women's Day, Her book \"[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17735532-mad-women Mad Women] - A ''Herstory'' of Advertising\" (OLIKA) was published out of Christina's personal frustration over the ad industry's lack of women, especially in creatives and leading positions. The book features stories from and about prominent female leaders in the advertising industry such as [[Rochelle Lazarus|Shelly Lazarus]], [[Cilla Snowball]], [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], Susan Hoffman, Nunu Ntshingila, Stefanie Wurst, and several others. With 10 American ad women and 4 women from around the world, the book hosts a diverse cast of potential role models.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://madwomen.info/thebook|title=MadWoman Book Info|date=March 10, 2018}}</ref> As a consequence, Christina has lectured all over the world about the importance of balance and diversity for the communications industry. In 2015, she left her position as Creative Director at INGO to found her own company, UKNIGHT, to fully focus on supporting the industry's development into a more representative and diverse industry. She works as a Copywriter and Creative Director as well as a consultant in the industry, lectures and also teaches at Berghs School of Communication in Stockholm, among other media schools. She is also a member of the board of WaterAid Sweden, of Fredrika Bremer Förbundet and the [[International Alliance of Women]].

With Christina Knight going on to lecture about women and marketing she has even spoke as a TEDxSSE speaker in April 2014. She spoke from experience, talking about how awkward it was for her to campaign women sanitary protection to men in a client meeting. She gives us a look into the marketing field that is prominently men, because in her own words only 3% of creative directors are women in the U.S.A. She spoke about the term 'the pink ghetto', a term that was coined in 1983 to described the portion of the labor market that is predominantly female professions. But in the advertising industry, the term is used more for when the women who are in the field are placed in areas where it is deemed as typically female, example is Christina Knights campaigning for women's sanitary protection, although she was able to get herself in other assignments such as telecom, cars and ventilation technology. Throughout her talk, she makes a point that there has been a lack of women. There were few women to look up to in that industry, and she has traveled to find women in the field to show the younger generations more role models. In her own words and findings she shows a list of percentages during her talk, Women account for 80% of all consumer purchases, 55% of all home electronic purchases, 89% of all financial purchases, 92% of all holiday trips decisions, and 90% of all care purchases (by influence). She shows this because she was making the point that in the advertising industry, if women are not being brought to the forefront in this field could be a lost in money. That marketing to women could be beneficial, but that doesn't mean just make it pink.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.adwomen.org/2009/05/interview-to-christina-knight/|title=Interview to Christina Knight – Clio 2009 jury member {{!}} AdWomen|website=www.adwomen.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-09}}</ref>

Her arguments are not about having more women, or having women take control of the workforce, but rather to have more equality in men dominated field so that there would be more balance. She believed with more equality comes more perspectives. In her interview for AdWomen in 2009, when the prospect of there ever being a segregation between whats being marketed for women and what's being marketed for men, she completely disagreed with that line of thinking. She argues that you need more women, not a separation. Even when something is more for women or more for men, in her experience, both sides listen but the difference is that both sides have different experiences and with that, opinions as well of course. So when a product that is more towards one gender is being made, then it could be easier to target that gender more successfully. When asked about how to target women and key factors to reached them, she denied there being a definite answer because that would generalize them. She spoke about role models and there importance to younger generations. How that while she was still in school she didn't have any female teachers. So she's made it a point to write about an essay on the subject and has become a role model herself as she holds lectures in that school now that she has rose the ranks herself to inspire the women there now because she acknowledges that there are talented men and women.<ref name=\":0\" />

<blockquote>''\"When I lecture I always get questions on what it is like to be a woman in advertising and how I have been able to stay on for so long. Young women who I mentor ask me where they can find the experiences and stories of advertising women. It is obvious that there is a lack of visible, inspiring women role models. The time was quite simply right for this book.” - Christina Knight (2013)''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://madwomen.info/|title=Mad Women – A Herstory of Advertising|date=March 10, 2018|website=madwomen.info/|access-date=March 10, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

In a GoSee interview, she stated that her book, Mad Women, was a prominently women centered publication it didn't mean that she didn't want men to read it. Why, the opposite is true, she hoped that men would read it and that a conversation could happened so that balance could be achieved that could better represent society today. With her book, she traveled to different parts of the world to find more women in the industry and interviewed them about their experience because that was the one thing these women had in common. The goal of the book was to share their stories, give advice to help improve the industry, but predominantly provide role models for up and coming ad women.

After ''Mad Women'', Knight left to start her own business, ''UKnight'', with the intention to work more focused on changing the structures and norms of society<ref name=\"marcommnews.com\"/>

'''Dover Grammar School for Boys''' is a highly selective, expensive [[Grammar school|selective]] [[secondary school]] located in [[Dover]], United Kingdom catering to posh bits. The school is situated next to [[Astor College]], a non-selective school.

==School History==
Founded in 1904 as '''County School for Boys and Girls''', the school was originally mixed-sex but moved into the present building in 1934 from Frith Road, now the home of [[Dover Grammar School for Girls]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dover in the Great War|last=Wynn|first=Stephen|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2017|isbn=9781473827936|location=|pages=168}}</ref>

Despite the severe economic circumstances of the depression, the founder and first headmaster of the school, Frederick Whitehouse persuaded the authorities to provide the funds for a new building in Astor Avenue.

Whitehouse believed in the maxim often attributed to [[Winston Churchill]] that \"we shape our buildings and our buildings shape us\" and, architecturally, the school mixes both gothic and classical influences.

Opened by the Duke of York, the future King [[George VI of the United Kingdom]], DGSB is one of few state school in Britain to have a working organ, which is housed in the Great Hall and leaves for [[Hamburg]] every 25 years for expert care and maintenance.

During World War II, the school building was requisitioned and used by the [[Royal Navy]] as a station for [[Women's Royal Naval Service|WRNS]] with pupils and staff evacuated to [[Ebbw Vale]] in south Wales.

A notable feature of the school building is a large stained glass window showing [[St. George]] and bearing the names of past students of the school who fell in World War Two with a separate memorial to students in World War One.

===Post-War Developments===
Following funding cost pressures, in 1991, the school established a joint 6th form with [[Dover Grammar School for Girls]] (DGSG) which continues to this day.

In 1994, the school became [[Grant Maintained]] after warding off a series of reorganisation proposals from [[Kent County Council]] including a relocation to the ex-Castlemount School Site in 1990<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tutthill|first=Graham|date=3 March 1990|title=Anger over Merger Bid|url=|journal=East Kent Mercury|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> as well as the amalgamation of the 2 grammar schools to a new modern construct in Whitfield in 1993.

In 2000, a second tower was erected that differed from the design of the existing tower (known as the Old Tower to pupils) to provide additional access to IT rooms built over the school workshops.

In 2006, as a result of its specialist status as a [[Business and Enterprise College]], the school received additional funding from the government, part of which was invested into a new Business & Enterprise suite.

In 2008 there were new proposals to move the school to Whitfield to be housed in a new building under the Labour government's [[Building Schools for the Future]] programme<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zendera|first=Yamurai|date=30 October 2008|title=Plans to relocate grammar schools|url=|journal=Dover Express|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> but this was cancelled after the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]] by Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]].

Students also witnessed the opening of the Brian Haines Suite, formally known as L7 (and previously room 17). This was to commemorate the exceptional amount of time that Brian Haines had served the school, from 1971 to 2009. It was decided that Brian Haines' dedication to the school earned this honour.

In 2019, plans have been drawn to demolish the existing buildings and erect a new modern school on the adjacent playing fields with completion set for 2022.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Plans to demolish and replace 1930s Dover Grammar School for Boys building, involving Department for Education|last=Lennon|first=Sam|date=27 February 2019|work=Kent Online|access-date=}}</ref>

== Athletics ==
The school has a strong sporting rivalry with Astor College and [[Sir Roger Manwood's School]], a selective Grammar school in [[Sandwich, Kent]].  With the arrival to the teaching staff of Major RA Hoeren, USAF Rtd in the early 1970s, American football and softball were particularly popular amongst the student population.

== Combined Cadet Force ==
The school also has a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) which is open to anyone from Year 8 upwards.

== Admissions ==
The school is selective and, in order to gain entry, the prospective student must first pass the 11+ examination, informally known as the \"Kent Test\".

==Murders==
In 1939, Cianciulli learned that her eldest son and favourite child, Giuseppe, was going to join the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] in preparation for [[World War II]]. She was determined to protect him at all costs, and came to the conclusion that his safety required [[human sacrifice]]s. Cianciulli found her victims in three middle-aged women, all neighbours.

===Faustina Setti===
The first of Cianciulli's victims, Faustina Setti, was a lifelong [[spinster]] who had come to her for help in finding a husband. Cianciulli told her of a suitable partner in [[Pula|Pola]], but asked her to tell no one of the news. She also persuaded Setti to write letters and postcards to relatives and friends. They were to be mailed when she reached Pola, to tell them that everything was fine. Preparing for her departure, Setti came to visit Cianciulli one last time. Cianciulli offered Setti a glass of drugged wine, then killed her with an axe and dragged the body into a closet. There she cut it into nine parts, gathering the blood into a basin. Cianciulli described what happened next in her official statement:

<blockquote> I threw the pieces into a pot, added seven kilos of caustic soda, which I had bought to make soap, and stirred the mixture until the pieces dissolved in a thick, dark mush that I poured into several buckets and emptied in a nearby septic tank. As for the blood in the basin, I waited until it had coagulated, dried it in the oven, ground it and mixed it with flour, sugar, chocolate, milk and eggs, as well as a bit of margarine, kneading all the ingredients together. I made lots of crunchy tea cakes and served them to the ladies who came to visit, though Giuseppe and I also ate them.<ref name=museocriminologico/></blockquote>

Some sources also record that Cianciulli apparently received Setti's life savings, 30,000 [[Italian lira|lire]], as payment for her services.<ref name=time>{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852845,00.html |title= Foreign News: A Copper Ladle |date= 24 June 1946 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>

===Francesca Soavi===
Francesca Soavi was the second victim. Cianciulli claimed to have found her a job at a school for girls in [[Piacenza]]. Like Setti, Soavi was persuaded to write postcards to be sent to friends, this time from Correggio, detailing her plans. Also like Setti, Soavi came to visit with Cianciulli before her departure. She too was given drugged wine and then killed with an axe. The murder occurred on 5 September 1940. Soavi's body was given the same treatment as Setti's, and Cianciulli is said to have obtained 3,000 lire<ref name=time/> from her second victim.

===Virginia Cacioppo===
Cianciulli's third and final victim was Virginia Cacioppo, a former [[soprano]] said to have sung at [[La Scala]]. For her, Cianciulli claimed to have found work as the secretary for a mysterious [[impresario]] in [[Florence]]. As with the other two women, she was instructed not to tell a single person where she was going. Cacioppo agreed, and on 30 September 1940, came for a last visit to Cianciulli. The pattern to the murder was the same as the first two. However, unlike the first two victims, Cacioppo's body was melted to make soap. According to Cianciulli's statement:

<blockquote>She ended up in the pot, like the other two...her flesh was fat and white, when it had melted I added a bottle of cologne, and after a long time on the boil I was able to make some most acceptable creamy soap. I gave bars to neighbours and acquaintances. The cakes, too, were better: that woman was really sweet.<ref name=museocriminologico/></blockquote>

From Cacioppo, Cianciulli reportedly received 50,000 lire, assorted jewels<ref name=time/> and public bonds. She even sold all the victims' clothing and shoes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://horroresrevelados.wordpress.com/2017/03/20/leonarda-cianciulli-creaba-jabones-con-humanos/|title=Leonarda Cianciulli: Creaba jabones con humanos|last=|first=|date=2017-03-20|website=Horrores Revelados|language=es-ES|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref>

==Discovery and trial==
Cacioppo's sister grew suspicious of her sudden disappearance, and had last seen her entering Cianciulli's house. She reported her fears to the superintendent of police in [[Reggio Emilia]], who opened an investigation and soon arrested Cianciulli. Cianciulli did not confess to the murders until they believed that her son, Giuseppe Pansardi, was involved in the crime. She confessed to the murders, providing detailed accounts of what she had done to save her son from any blame.

Cianciulli was tried for murder in Reggio Emilia in 1946. She remained unrepentant, going so far as to correct the official account while on the stand:

<blockquote>At her trial in Reggio Emilia last week Poetess Leonarda gripped the witness-stand rail with oddly delicate hands and calmly set the prosecutor right on certain details. Her deep-set dark eyes gleamed with a wild inner pride as she concluded: \"I gave the copper ladle, which I used to skim the fat off the kettles, to my country, which was so badly in need of metal during the last days of the war....\"<ref name=time/></blockquote>

She was found guilty of her crimes and sentenced to thirty years in prison and three years in a criminal asylum.<ref>http://leonardacianciulli.weebly.com/assessment.html</ref>

Cianciulli died of [[Cerebral hemorrhage|cerebral apoplexy]] in the women's criminal asylum in [[Pozzuoli]] on 15 October 1970. A number of artifacts from the case, including the pot in which the victims were boiled, are on display at the [[Criminological Museum]] in [[Rome]].<ref name=museocriminologico/>

A darkly comic play about Cianciulli, ''Love and Magic in Mama's Kitchen'', was first produced by [[Lina Wertmuller]] at the [[Spoleto Festival]] in 1979.

'''Leonarda Cianciulli''' (18 April 1894 – 15 October 1970) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[serial killer]]. Better known as the '''\"Soap-Maker of Correggio\"''' (Italian: ''la Saponificatrice di Correggio''),<ref name=bbc>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27257822 |title= Sodium: Getting rid of dirt - and murder victims |date= 3 May 2014 |publisher= [[BBC News]]}}</ref> she murdered three women in the town of [[Correggio, Italy|Correggio]], [[Province of Reggio Emilia|Reggio Emilia]], between 1939 and 1940, and turned their bodies into soap and teacakes.

==Early life==
Leonarda Cianciulli was born in [[Montella]], [[Province of Avellino|Avellino]]. While still a young girl, she attempted [[suicide]] twice. In 1917, Cianciulli married a [[Civil registry|registry office]] [[clerk (position)|clerk]], Raffaele Pansardi. Her parents did not approve of the marriage, as they had planned to marry her to another man. Cianciulli claimed that on this occasion her mother cursed them. In 1921, the couple moved to Pansardi's native town of [[Lauria]], [[Province of Potenza|Potenza]], where Cianciulli was sentenced and imprisoned for [[fraud]] in 1927. When released, the couple moved to [[Lacedonia|Lacedonia, Avellino]]. After their home was destroyed in the [[1930 Irpinia earthquake]], they moved once more to [[Correggio, Italy|Correggio]], [[Province of Reggio Emilia|Reggio Emilia]], where Cianciulli opened a small shop. She was very popular and well-respected within her neighborhood.<ref name=bbc/>

Cianciulli had seventeen pregnancies during her marriage, but lost three of the children to [[miscarriage]]. Ten more died in their youth. Consequently, she was heavily protective of the four surviving children. Her fears were fueled by a warning she had received some time earlier from a [[fortune teller]], who said that she would marry and have children, but that all of the children would die young. Reportedly, Cianciulli also visited a [[Romani people|Romani]] who practiced [[palm reading]], and who told her, \"In your right hand I see prison, in your left a criminal [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]].\"<ref name=museocriminologico>{{cite web|url=http://www.museocriminologico.it/correggio_uk.htm |title=The Correggio soap-maker |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912155116/http://www.museocriminologico.it/correggio_uk.htm |archivedate=2006-09-12 }} Exhibit at Rome's Criminological Museum.</ref>

'''Paulo Jorge Rebelo Duarte''' (born 6 April 1969) is a Portuguese retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], and a current [[Manager (association football)|manager]].

During a 17-year senior career, he amassed [[Primeira Liga]] totals of 238 matches and eight goals over 12 seasons, representing mainly [[U.D. Leiria|União de Leiria]]. He became a manager in 2006, also working with that club and later being in charge of the [[Burkina Faso national football team|Burkina Faso]] and [[Gabon national football team|Gabon national teams]].

==Playing career==
Duarte was born in [[Massarelos]], [[Porto District]]. After playing youth football for local [[Boavista F.C.]] and starting out as a senior at [[C.F. União de Coimbra]], he signed for [[U.D. Leiria]] in 1988, also in the [[Segunda Liga|second division]].

Duarte then played two seasons apiece for [[S.C. Salgueiros]] and [[C.S. Marítimo]], making his [[Primeira Liga]] debut with the former and appearing in a total of 84 league games the two clubs combined. Subsequently, he returned to Leiria who now competed in the [[Portuguese football league system|Portuguese top flight]], retiring after almost one decade at the age of 34 and acting as first-choice in four of those campaigns (in [[2001–02 Primeira Liga|2001–02]], as the team [[2002 UEFA Intertoto Cup|qualified]] for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], he was managed by young [[José Mourinho]]).

==Coaching career==
After his retirement, Duarte immediately began his managerial career, staying with his last club Leiria as assistant. In the tenth round of [[2006–07 Primeira Liga|2006–07's top division]] he was named coach of the first team, eventually helping them finish seventh.

In late 2007, Duarte left Leiria<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=613521.html Paulo Duarte leaves Leiria]; UEFA, 5 November 2007</ref> and, a couple of months later, was appointed manager of [[Burkina Faso national football team|Burkina Faso]]. On 2 June 2009, however, he was signed by France's [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans Union Club 72]] on a two-year contract while still working with the national side.<ref>[http://goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2009/06/02/1301254/le-mans-appoint-burkina-faso-coach-paulo-duarte-as-new Le Mans appoint Burkina Faso coach Paulo Duarte as new trainer]; [[Goal (website)|Goal]], 2 June 2009</ref>

Duarte was fired by Le Mans on 8 December 2009, becoming the first [[Ligue 1]] manager casualty in [[2009–10 Ligue 1|the season]],<ref>
[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=710598&cc=5739 Le Mans sack coach Duarte]; [[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]], 10 December 2009</ref> but still was on the bench for Burkina Faso's [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]] campaign, exiting in the group stage after one draw and one loss (the team was in [[Togo national football team|Togo]]'s group). On 17 February 2012, following three matches and as many losses at the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations]], he was dismissed.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17075218 Burkina Faso coach gets the boot]; [[BBC Sport]], 17 February 2012</ref>

'''Paulo Jorge Rebelo Duarte''' (born 6 April 1969) is a Portuguese retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], and a [[Manager (association football)|manager]].

During a 17-year senior career, he amassed [[Primeira Liga]] totals of 238 matches and eight goals over 12 seasons, representing mainly [[U.D. Leiria|União de Leiria]]. He became a manager in 2006, also working with that club and later being in charge of the [[Burkina Faso national football team|Burkina Faso]] and [[Gabon national football team|Gabon national teams]].

==Playing career==
Duarte was born in [[Massarelos]], [[Porto District]]. After playing youth football for local [[Boavista F.C.]] and starting out as a senior at [[C.F. União de Coimbra]], he signed for [[U.D. Leiria]] in 1988, also in the [[Segunda Liga|second division]].

Duarte then played two seasons apiece for [[S.C. Salgueiros]] and [[C.S. Marítimo]], making his [[Primeira Liga]] debut with the former and appearing in a total of 84 league games the two clubs combined. Subsequently, he returned to Leiria who now competed in the [[Portuguese football league system|Portuguese top flight]], retiring after almost one decade at the age of 34 and acting as first-choice in four of those campaigns (in [[2001–02 Primeira Liga|2001–02]], as the team [[2002 UEFA Intertoto Cup|qualified]] for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], he was managed by young [[José Mourinho]]).

==Coaching career==
After his retirement, Duarte immediately began his managerial career, staying with his last club Leiria as assistant. In the tenth round of [[2006–07 Primeira Liga|2006–07's top division]] he was named coach of the first team, eventually helping them finish seventh.

In late 2007, Duarte left Leiria<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=613521.html Paulo Duarte leaves Leiria]; UEFA, 5 November 2007</ref> and, a couple of months later, was appointed manager of [[Burkina Faso national football team|Burkina Faso]]. On 2 June 2009, however, he was signed by France's [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans Union Club 72]] on a two-year contract while still working with the national side.<ref>[http://goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2009/06/02/1301254/le-mans-appoint-burkina-faso-coach-paulo-duarte-as-new Le Mans appoint Burkina Faso coach Paulo Duarte as new trainer]; [[Goal (website)|Goal]], 2 June 2009</ref>

Duarte was fired by Le Mans on 8 December 2009, becoming the first [[Ligue 1]] manager casualty in [[2009–10 Ligue 1|the season]],<ref>
[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=710598&cc=5739 Le Mans sack coach Duarte]; [[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]], 10 December 2009</ref> but still was on the bench for Burkina Faso's [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]] campaign, exiting in the group stage after one draw and one loss (the team was in [[Togo national football team|Togo]]'s group). On 17 February 2012, following three matches and as many losses at the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations]], he was dismissed.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17075218 Burkina Faso coach gets the boot]; [[BBC Sport]], 17 February 2012</ref>

On 29 April 2012, Duarte was appointed interim coach of the [[Gabon national football team|Gabon national team]]. He was sacked on 23 September of the following year, after failing to qualify the country for both the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualification#Second round|2013 Africa Cup of Nations]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – CAF Second Round#Group E|2014 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=2179701.html Paulo Duarte fired by Gabon]; FIFA, 23 September 2013</ref>

'''Mike and Ike''' is a brand of fruit-flavored [[Candy|candies]] that were first introduced in 1942 by the company [[Just Born]], Inc. The origin of the candy's name remains unknown, but there are many conjectures. Mike and Ikes were originally all fruit flavored but now come in several different varieties which have been introduced over the years.

==History==
The Mike and Ike brand was first introduced in 1940 by Just Born, Inc., which is located in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4jIOEZ5F9fAC&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=%22Mike+and+Ike%22+%22just+born%22+1940&source=bl&ots=xEV3rueYeK&sig=SDnejSqosHoEEv2eRSyXXiBXBic&hl=en&ei=vEicTPvjHcLflgfLldjBCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=%22Mike%20and%20Ike%22%20%22just%20born%22%201940&f=false|author=Andrew F. Smith |title=Encyclopedia of junk food and fast food |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}</ref> Its origin uncertain, the name may have come from the comic strip [[Mike and Ike (They Look Alike)]], which, however, had ended by the 1940s. Or the name may have referred to the [[Matina Brothers]], two of whom, nicknamed \"Mike\" & \"Ike,\" were billed as circus midgets and had roles as [[Munchkin]]s in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''; the author [[Dean Jensen]] wrote without cited evidence that the two became so popular in America that a boxed candy was named after them.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJAvsvanFwMC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=Matina+midget+candy&source=bl&ots=6iGSO3eu6M&sig=6qkKU-aFhkEDs1CUZ9aMkiOjzVo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7vJD6psfTAhXH4yYKHSuCAqgQ6AEINzAH#v=onepage&q=Matina%20midget%20candy&f=false|title=The Lives and Loves of Daisy and Violet Hilton: A True Story of Conjoined Twins|author=Dean Jensen|publisher=Ten Speed Press|page=53|ISBN=978-1580087582|date=September 1, 2006|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref>  Other proposals include a company-wide contest, a [[vaudeville]] song titled “Mike and Ike”, and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], whose nickname was \"Ike.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oldtimecandy.com/walk-the-candy-aisle/mike-ike|title=Mike & Ike History|work=Old Time Candy|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref> Just Born acquired the ''Rodda Candy Company'' in 1953 and produced new flavors of the candy, such as cotton candy. Additional flavors such as Root Beer came in the 1960s, and others have been introduced on and off since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/69293/10-sweet-and-colorful-facts-about-mike-and-ike|title=10 Sweet and Colorful Facts About Mike and Ike|author=Jeff Wells|work=Mental Floss|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Candy==
Mike and Ike are oblong fruit-flavored chewy candies that come in several colors and varieties, including cherry, orange, lime, lemon, and strawberry. Popular varieties are Tropical Typhoon, Berry Blast and Jolly Joes. Each candy has 7 calories, 0 grams of fat, and approximately 1 gram of sugar.  The candy is [[kosher]] and [[gluten-free]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/justborn/33812/docs/33812-M&I_Fun_Facts.7.2.08pdf.pdf |title=Fruity Facts about Mike and Ike |publisher=Just Born |date= |accessdate=September 24, 2010}}</ref>

They are similar to [[Hot Tamales]], another candy introduced by the same manufacturer in 1950, though they are not spicy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&pg=PT365&dq=%22Mike+and+Ike%22+%22just+born%22+1940&hl=en&ei=vkecTIffCoGKlweruZ2PCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Mike%20and%20Ike%22%20%22just%20born%22%201940&f=false|author=Andrew F.

==Media==
In April 2012, the company ran an ad campaign based on the premise that Mike and Ike were \"breaking up\" due to \"creative differences\"; the packaging showed one or the other name scratched out. The campaign was intended to capture the interest of younger consumers.<ref>{{cite news | first = Maryclaire | last = Dale | title = Mike and Ike announce split in cheeky ad campaign | date = April 13, 2012 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-04/D9U4ADMG1.htm | agency = [[Associated Press]] |work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | accessdate = May 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Dave | last = Bangert | title = A culture war in the candy aisle | date = April 28, 2012 | url = http://www.jconline.com/article/20120429/COLUMNISTS30/120428023/Bangert-A-culture-war-in-the-candy-aisle-?odyssey=tab/mostpopular/text/FRONTPAGE | work = [[Journal & Courier]] | accessdate = May 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Ana Marie | last = Cox | title = Same-sex marriage amendments: bigotry's last gasp | date = May 8, 2012 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/08/same-sex-marriage-amendments | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = May 15, 2012}}</ref> In 2013 the company announced Mike and Ike would reunite. In addition to a re-designed packaging and juicier tasting candy, a trailer for a movie was released, entitled, ''The Return of Mike and Ike.''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/mike-and-ikes-breakup-lifted-sales-and-social-148183 | title=Mike and Ike's 'Breakup' Lifted Sales and Social | publisher=ADWEEK | date=2013-03-27 | accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref>

'''Mike and Ike''' is a brand of fruit-flavored [[Candy|candies]] that were first introduced in 1942 by the company [[Just Born]], Inc. The origin of the candy's name remains unknown, but there are many conjectures. Mike and Ikes were originally all fruit flavored but now come in several different varieties which have been introduced over the years.

==History==
The Mike and Ike brand was first introduced in 1940 by Just Born, Inc., which is located in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4jIOEZ5F9fAC&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=%22Mike+and+Ike%22+%22just+born%22+1940&source=bl&ots=xEV3rueYeK&sig=SDnejSqosHoEEv2eRSyXXiBXBic&hl=en&ei=vEicTPvjHcLflgfLldjBCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=%22Mike%20and%20Ike%22%20%22just%20born%22%201940&f=false|author=Andrew F. Smith |title=Encyclopedia of junk food and fast food |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}</ref> Its origin uncertain, the name may have come from the comic strip [[Mike and Ike (They Look Alike)]], which, however, had ended by the 1940s. Or the name may have referred to the [[Matina Brothers]], two of whom, nicknamed \"Mike\" & \"Ike,\" were billed as circus midgets and had roles as [[Munchkin]]s in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''; the author [[Dean Jensen]] wrote without cited evidence that the two became so popular in America that a boxed candy was named after them.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJAvsvanFwMC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=Matina+midget+candy&source=bl&ots=6iGSO3eu6M&sig=6qkKU-aFhkEDs1CUZ9aMkiOjzVo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7vJD6psfTAhXH4yYKHSuCAqgQ6AEINzAH#v=onepage&q=Matina%20midget%20candy&f=false|title=The Lives and Loves of Daisy and Violet Hilton: A True Story of Conjoined Twins|author=Dean Jensen|publisher=Ten Speed Press|page=53|ISBN=978-1580087582|date=September 1, 2006|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref> . Other proposals include a company-wide contest, a [[vaudeville]] song titled “Mike and Ike”, and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], whose nickname was \"Ike.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oldtimecandy.com/walk-the-candy-aisle/mike-ike|title=Mike & Ike History|work=Old Time Candy|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref> Just Born acquired the ''Rodda Candy Company'' in 1953 and produced new flavors of the candy, such as cotton candy. Additional flavors such as Root Beer came in the 1960s, and others have been introduced on and off since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/69293/10-sweet-and-colorful-facts-about-mike-and-ike|title=10 Sweet and Colorful Facts About Mike and Ike|author=Jeff Wells|work=Mental Floss|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Candy==
Mike and Ike are oblong fruit-flavored chewy candies that come in several colors and varieties, including cherry, orange, lime, lemon, and strawberry. Popular varieties are Tropical Typhoon, Berry Blast and Jolly Joes. Each candy has 7 calories, 0 grams of fat, and approximately 1 gram of sugar.  The candy is [[kosher]] and [[gluten-free]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/justborn/33812/docs/33812-M&I_Fun_Facts.7.2.08pdf.pdf |title=Fruity Facts about Mike and Ike |publisher=Just Born |date= |accessdate=September 24, 2010}}</ref>

They are similar to [[Hot Tamales]], another candy introduced by the same manufacturer in 1950, though they are not spicy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&pg=PT365&dq=%22Mike+and+Ike%22+%22just+born%22+1940&hl=en&ei=vkecTIffCoGKlweruZ2PCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Mike%20and%20Ike%22%20%22just%20born%22%201940&f=false|author=Andrew F.

==Media==
In April 2012, the company ran an ad campaign based on the premise that Mike and Ike were \"breaking up\" due to \"creative differences\"; the packaging showed one or the other name scratched out. The campaign was intended to capture the interest of younger consumers.<ref>{{cite news | first = Maryclaire | last = Dale | title = Mike and Ike announce split in cheeky ad campaign | date = April 13, 2012 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-04/D9U4ADMG1.htm | agency = [[Associated Press]] |work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | accessdate = May 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Dave | last = Bangert | title = A culture war in the candy aisle | date = April 28, 2012 | url = http://www.jconline.com/article/20120429/COLUMNISTS30/120428023/Bangert-A-culture-war-in-the-candy-aisle-?odyssey=tab/mostpopular/text/FRONTPAGE | work = [[Journal & Courier]] | accessdate = May 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Ana Marie | last = Cox | title = Same-sex marriage amendments: bigotry's last gasp | date = May 8, 2012 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/08/same-sex-marriage-amendments | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = May 15, 2012}}</ref> In 2013 the company announced Mike and Ike would reunite. In addition to a re-designed packaging and juicier tasting candy, a trailer for a movie was released, entitled, ''The Return of Mike and Ike.''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/mike-and-ikes-breakup-lifted-sales-and-social-148183 | title=Mike and Ike's 'Breakup' Lifted Sales and Social | publisher=ADWEEK | date=2013-03-27 | accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref>

The song \"Summer Moon\" started out as a different title, \"Surfer Moon\" which was previously recorded by [[Bob Norberg (musician)|Bob Norberg]] & Sheri Pomeroy. On May 1963, Brian Wilson got together with some top [[Los Angeles]] session musicians who would later become [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]]. This time Norberg recorded it with a local singer and future actress [[Victoria Hale (actress)|Victoria Hale]], the song was recorded at [[United Western Recorders|United Recorders]]. Jan Berry took care of the string arrangements.<ref>The Second Disc, December 17, 2013 - [https://theseconddisc.com/2013/12/17/the-beatles-and-the-beach-boys-beat-the-boots-on-the-big-beat-1963-and-bootleg-recordings/ NEWS, The Beatles and The Beach Boys Beat The Boots On “The Big Beat 1963” and “Bootleg Recordings” By Joe Marchese]</ref><ref>Casting Networks Inc. - [https://cni.castingnetworks.com/talent/profile/17240 VICTORIA HALE]</ref><ref>''The Words and Music of Brian Wilson'', By Christian Matijas-Mecca - {{ISBN|1440838984}} - [https://books.google.com/books?id=wmphDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=%22Bob+%26+Sheri%22Surfer+Moon%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Bob%20&f=false Pages 6 - 7 '''Hits''']</ref> Victoria Hale was known as Vickie Kocher back then. Having already rehearsed their vocals at Norberg's Crenshaw Park apartment, they recorded the song at the Western Studio. Brian Wilson's vocals were also added to the recording.  A three track recording was done and Wilson had made a rough dub was made. Wilson also gave Kocher an acetate to have as a keepsake.<ref>''Becoming the Beach Boys, 1961-1963'', By James B.

There is no [[evidence]] that Vaginal Steaming has any benefits,<ref name=HarvardHealth>https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/what-is-vaginal-steaming</ref> and can be dangerous and can lead to [[Vaginal Yeast Infection]] by leading to an influx of [[bacteria]].<ref name=HarvardHealth />

==Prevalence==
According to a study on [[vagina]]l practices by the [[World Health Organization]] published in 2011, one of the ways in which women practice vaginal care is by \"Vaginal steaming or smoking: the 'steaming' or 'smoking' of the vagina, by sitting above a source of heat (fire, coals, hot rocks) on which water, herbs, or oils are placed to create steam or smoke\".<ref name=jwh/> For that study, over 4,000 women in  Tete (Mozambique), KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), Yogyakarta (Indonesia), and Chonburi (Thailand) were asked about their vaginal care. When it came to vaginal steaming/smoking, very different results were obtained, and very different reasons were given: in Chonburi, 67% of women reported having performed vaginal steaming or smoking, \"which they associated with  maintaining  wellness  and  feminine  identity\", especially after [[Postpartum period|having given birth]] (85.5%). In Tete, only 10% of women practiced steaming or smoking, \"mostly intended to enhance male sexual pleasure by causing vaginal tightening (64.1% of users) and drying (22.9%)\". In the two African locations, 37–38% of women said they practiced it to enhance \"male sexual pleasure\"; in the two Asian ones, 0% gave that answer. Conversely, of the Asian women 26% reported their \"feminine identity\" was a reason, compared to 0% of the African women.<ref name=jwh/>

analyzed \"90 online items related to vaginal steaming\", including from newspapers and magazines, blogs, and providers of the practice. They identified a general theme, that of the \"self-improving woman\", which they argue fits in perfectly with modern constructions of what scholarship has called the \"neoliberal\" woman, a woman who, free of outside influences, seeks to optimize herself and her health (see [[Healthism]]). Within that theme, they found four attitudes that promote healthist practices such as vaginal steaming:
# The female body is inherently defective and dirty, and deteriorates with age: \"the female body [is] situated within this biologically-determinist narrative of inevitable decline\" which can be resisted.{{r|VB|p=475}}
# Western medicine and bodily care (including tampon use, for instance) make the female genitalia unnaturally full of toxins, a process that can be reversed by the natural practice of vaginal steaming (the authors note that such accounts are themselves littered with language derived from Western medicine—\"symptoms\", \"decline\", \"ailments\").{{r|VB|p=476}}
# Health enhancement, and the optimization of the body, specifically fertility and sexual pleasure, with much of the language used by advertisers of spas focusing on \"maintenance\" and \"restoration\", reinforcing both healthism and the fetishization of youth; vaginal steaming, it is claimed, improves marriages and the male libido. According to the authors, \"the sexual and reproductive enhancement focus mirrors the two modes through which Western societies have traditionally valued women: sexual availability for men (within marriage) and childbearing\".{{r|VB|p=478}}
# The pampering of the self-assured woman, a luxury as well as a right that they have earned, with advertising playing on the \"reawakening\" of the \"inner goddess\": \"To awaken your inner goddess, please call us at...\" The idea is that the practice allows a woman to reach her true potential, her true self.{{r|VB|p=479}}

The authors conclude that vaginal steaming is one of many practices that fit \"neoliberal, postfeminist and healthist ideologies, colliding with pervasive sociocultural understandings of the female reproductive body both as core of womanhood and as 'embodied pathology{{'\"}}.{{r|VB|p=480}}

# Health enhancement, and the optimization of the body, specifically fertility and sexual pleasure, with much of the language used by advertisers of spas focusing on \"maintenance\" and \"restoration\", reinforcing both healthism and the fetishization of youth; vaginal steaming, it is claimed, improves marriages and the male libido. According to the authors, \"the sexual and reproductive enhancement focus mirrors the two modes through which Western societies have traditionally valued women: sexual availability for men (within marriage) and childbearing\".{{r|VB|p=478}}
# The pampering of the self-assured woman, a luxury as well as a right that they have earned, with advertising playing on the \"reawakening\" of the \"inner goddess\": \"To awaken your inner goddess, please call us at...\" The idea is that the practice allows a woman to reach her true potential, her true self.{{r|VB|p=479}}

The authors conclude that vaginal steaming is one of many practices that fit \"neoliberal, postfeminist and healthist ideologies, colliding with pervasive sociocultural understandings of the female reproductive body both as core of womanhood and as 'embodied pathology{{'\"}}.{{r|VB|p=480}}

Zarak Khan ([[Victor Mature]]) is the son of a chief, who is caught embracing one of his father's wives Salma ([[Anita Ekberg]]).

==The real Zarak Khan==
The film is based on a 1950 book, written by A.J. Bevan, which contained a foreword by Field Marshal [[William Slim]].<ref>War-Time Enterprises and Escapes: AN OCEAN WITHOUT SHORES
Jennings, C O; Bentwich, Norman; Bevan, A J. The Scotsman (1921-1950) [Edinburgh, Scotland] 20 July 1950: 9</ref> According to Bevan, the real Zarak Khan was an Afghan who spent most of his life fighting the British in the northwest frontier in the 1920s and 1930s. Among his crimes was the murder of a holy man. He eventually gave himself up and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the [[Andaman Islands]]. However, when the Japanese occupied the islands he stayed in his cell.

Khan was eventually given a suspended sentence and decided to work for the British in Burma. In 1943 he was leading a patrol when its British officer was killed in an ambush. He watched another British patrol be attacked by the Japanese and sent messengers to summon a [[Gurkha]] force. To stop the Japanese from escaping with their prisoners before the Gurkhas arrived, he attacked them single-handed, and killed or wounded six soldiers before being overpowered. He refused to be beheaded and insisted on being [[flayed alive]] to buy time to enable the Gurkhas to arrive.<ref>{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Don |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52798775 |title=Bravest of them all! |newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]] |location=Launceston, Tasmania |date=16 December 1950 |accessdate=10 June 2016 |page=1, Magazine section}} At [[Trove]], [[National Library of Australia]]</ref>

Dan LeRoy from [[AllMusic]] found the album \"overlong and musically malnourished\" with its track listing and overuse of lazy sampling but gave credit to Romeo's charm on songs like \"True Love\" and \"2-Way\", concluding that he should follow in the footsteps of [[Will Smith]] and go into acting instead.<ref name=\"AM\"/> [[Jon Caramanica]], writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', said that ''Game Time'' \"doesn't have much to recommend it, but if nothing else, Romeo has got his target demo on lock.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> Robert Ford of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt throughout the album that \"an overabundance of samples and fluff, not to mention unskilled flow, proves Romeo is still lil’ league.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/>

Dan LeRoy from [[AllMusic]] found the album \"overlong and musically malnourished\" with its track listing and overuse of lazy sampling but gave credit to Romeo's charm on songs like \"True Love\" and \"2-Way\", concluding that he should follow in the footsteps of [[Will Smith]] and go into acting instead.<ref name=\"AM\"/> [[Jon Caramanica]], writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', said that ''Game Time'' \"doesn't have much to recommend it, but if nothing else, Romeo has got his target demo on lock.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> Robert Ford of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt throughout the album that \"an overabundance of samples and fluff, not to mention unskilled flow, proves Romeo is still lil’ league.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/>

'''Warren Brown''' (August 11, 1836 – September 19, 1919) was an American politician, historian, gentleman farmer, businessman, and author from [[Hampton Falls, New Hampshire]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Warren Brown was born in [[Hampton Falls, New Hampshire]], the only child of John Berry and Sarah March Leavitt Brown.  He was educated in the North School in Hampton Falls, the old Rockingham Academy in [[Hampton, New Hampshire|Hampton]], and [[Phillips Academy|Phillips-Andover Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]].<ref>Brown, Warren. ''History of Hampton Falls N.H. Vol. II''. 1918. Rumford Press. [[Concord, New Hampshire]]</ref>

===Later life===
Brown married [[Sarah Gertrude Norris]] on January 1, 1867.<ref name=WB75>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48627344/hon-warren-brown-is-75/ |title=Hon.

She subsequently moved to Hampton, where she taught in the public schools until her marriage. Warren and Sarah had five children:

** [[Dorothy Swain|Dorothy Gertrude]] (June 30, 1918 – February 17, 2011)

Sarah Brown died on January 24, 1917, after celebrating the couple's Golden Wedding anniversary on January 1 of that year. She was eulogized by her husband as being a \"person of great executive ability and force of character.\"

Brown had a lifelong interest in agricultural matters. He managed and worked one of the largest and most productive farms in [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham County]]. His farm included orchards, salt marsh, dairy cattle, sheep and gardens sufficient to maintain his family and the employees for whom he provided room and board.

Brown was president of the [[New Hampshire State Agricultural Society]] for eleven years, treasurer of the [[New England Agricultural Society]] for twenty-five years, trustee of the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] for 24 years, including four years served as Chairman of the Board.

In addition to agricultural interests, Brown was active in state politics. He was a state senator in 1872–73, a member of the state's [[Executive Council of New Hampshire|Executive Council]] from 1879 to 1881 during the term of [[Nathaniel Head|Natt Head]] as Governor, and a delegate to [[1884 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref name=WB75/> He was a state representative in 1887, and a presidential elector in [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]]. He was also a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].<ref name=WB75/> Brown was a stockholder and active promoter of the electric railways in southern New Hampshire,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48628773/stockholders-elected-at-portsmouth/ |title=Stockholders Elected at Portsmouth |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=12 |date=November 26, 1900 |accessdate=April 13, 2020 |via=newspapers.com}}</ref> and owned and operated a sawmill on his estate.

Brown was a true native son, descended from many of the original settlers of the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|New Hampshire Seacoast Region]], and very interested in his town's history. He wrote a two-volume history of Hampton Falls: ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume I'' and ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume II''. Volume I spans from 1640 to 1900, while Volume II spans from 1900 to 1917.

===Death===
Brown died September 19, 1919.  He was buried in the family lot in the Westview Cemetery of Hampton Falls. He was predeceased by his wife Sarah, his daughter Gertrude and his son Harry.

==Residence==
[[File:Sunnyside_residence_of_Warren_Brown_(politician).png|thumb|right|Brown's residence, Sunnyside, as published in his ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H.'']]
Brown owned and operated a highly successful farm on family land purchased by his father in 1812. On this property, in 1880, he built a [[Victorian house|Victorian style home]] which replaced his parents' center-chimney [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] house. This new home, called Sunnyside, was designed by his beloved wife Sarah Gertrude; architectural plans were drawn for her by a Mr. Bruce of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].  The house remained in the family until the 1960s.  Its unique presence in a town of mainly colonial styled architecture, its resemblance to [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'']] house and the years between owners when it was vacant, have perhaps helped to make it the source of speculation by locals and newcomers alike.

For many years, a rumor circulated stating that Brown made an unsuccessful run for [[Governor of New Hampshire]] and that his Victorian style house was built in anticipation of its being \"the Governor's mansion\", a name it became known by. In truth, his wife Sarah, a woman of innovation and industry, designed Sunnyside to be a practical and beautiful home where the couple could entertain in style and operate their large estate with efficiently. After numerous experiences, the current owners have brought in many paranormal teams to prove spectral activity on this property and had it investigated in 2012 by [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] ( T.A.P.S.) for the [[Syfy]] television series [[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|''Ghost Hunters'']].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20160414/NEWS/160419448 |title=‘Haunted in New England’ to film at Hampton Falls mansion |first=Max |last=Sullivan |website=seacoastonline.com |date=April 14, 2016 |accessdate=April 12, 2020 |quote=The home was built around 1880 by Warren Brown, a prominent New Hampshire politician.}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Brown Road, abutting his former property in Hampton Falls, is named for Warren Brown.

On April 17, 2006, a group of Hampton Falls people formed the Warren Brown Foundation and created a website. The Foundation was dedicated to \"discovering the Brown family's past and improving what is left.\" The group has since been discontinued as it was the act of uninformed newcomers who discovered the family had not disappeared into obscurity.  Many of Warren and Sarah Brown's descendants still live in the greater Hampton Falls area and take umbrage at the rewriting of their family's history.

Sarah Brown died on January 24, 1917, after celebrating the couple's Golden Wedding anniversary on January 1 of that year. She was eulogized by her husband as being a \"person of great executive ability and force of character.\"

Brown had a lifelong interest in agricultural matters. He managed and worked one of the largest and most productive farms in [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham County]]. His farm included orchards, salt marsh, dairy cattle, sheep and gardens sufficient to maintain his family and the employees for whom he provided room and board.

Brown was president of the [[New Hampshire State Agricultural Society]] for eleven years, treasurer of the [[New England Agricultural Society]] for twenty-five years, trustee of the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] for 24 years, including four years served as Chairman of the Board.

In addition to agricultural interests, Brown was active in state politics. He was a state senator in 1872–73, a member of the state's [[Executive Council of New Hampshire|Executive Council]] from 1879 to 1881 during the term of [[Nathaniel Head|Natt Head]] as Governor, and a delegate to [[1884 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref name=WB75/> He was a state representative in 1887, and a presidential elector in [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]]. He was also a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].<ref name=WB75/> Brown was a stock holder and active promoter of the electric railways in southern New Hampshire and owned and operated a sawmill on his estate.

Brown was a true native son, descended from many of the original settlers of the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|New Hampshire Seacoast Region]], and very interested in his town's history. He wrote a two-volume history of Hampton Falls: ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume I'' and ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume II''. Volume I spans from 1640 to 1900, while Volume II spans from 1900 to 1917.

===Death===
Brown died September 19, 1919.  He was buried in the family lot in the Westview Cemetery of Hampton Falls. He was predeceased by his wife Sarah, his daughter Gertrude and his son Harry.

==Residence==
[[File:Sunnyside_residence_of_Warren_Brown_(politician).png|thumb|right|Brown's residence, Sunnyside, as published in his ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H.'']]
Brown owned and operated a highly successful farm on family land purchased by his father in 1812. On this property, in 1880, he built a [[Victorian house|Victorian style home]] which replaced his parents' center-chimney [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] house. This new home, called Sunnyside, was designed by his beloved wife Sarah Gertrude; architectural plans were drawn for her by a Mr. Bruce of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].  The house remained in the family until the 1960s.  Its unique presence in a town of mainly colonial styled architecture, its resemblance to [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'']] house and the years between owners when it was vacant, have perhaps helped to make it the source of speculation by locals and newcomers alike.

For many years, a rumor circulated stating that Brown made an unsuccessful run for [[Governor of New Hampshire]] and that his Victorian style house was built in anticipation of its being \"the Governor's mansion\", a name it became known by. In truth, his wife Sarah, a woman of innovation and industry, designed Sunnyside to be a practical and beautiful home where the couple could entertain in style and operate their large estate with efficiently. After numerous experiences, the current owners have brought in many paranormal teams to prove spectral activity on this property and had it investigated in 2012 by [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] ( T.A.P.S.) for the [[Syfy]] television series [[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|''Ghost Hunters'']].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20160414/NEWS/160419448 |title=‘Haunted in New England’ to film at Hampton Falls mansion |first=Max |last=Sullivan |website=seacoastonline.com |date=April 14, 2016 |accessdate=April 12, 2020 |quote=The home was built around 1880 by Warren Brown, a prominent New Hampshire politician.}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Brown Road, abutting his former property in Hampton Falls, is named for Warren Brown.

On April 17, 2006, a group of Hampton Falls people formed the Warren Brown Foundation and created a website. The Foundation was dedicated to \"discovering the Brown family's past and improving what is left.\" The group has since been discontinued as it was the act of uninformed newcomers who discovered the family had not disappeared into obscurity.  Many of Warren and Sarah Brown's descendants still live in the greater Hampton Falls area and take umbrage at the rewriting of their family's history.
