He was one of the first photographers to produce images of Egypt and documented the Suez Canal project with extensive photographs and a publication.\n\n==Life and career==\nVery little is known about this photographer, other than that he was active in the Nile Valley from about 1869 through to at least 1890. His place and date of birth are unknown, but he is known to have been French. Similarly, his place and date of death are unknown, as is his final resting place. <ref>Hannavy, J., ''Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography,'' Routledge, 2013, p. 73; It may be worth noting that some scholars suggest that Arnoux was in Egypt at the earlier date of 1860 or 1865, see for instance, Um, N., \"Bridging the Mediterranean and Gujarat with the Turn of a Page: Picturing the Dimensions of Maritime Travel in an Extra-Illustrated Nineteenth-Century Book about India,\" ''Getty Research Journal,'' 2016, p. 242</ref>\n \nBy the 1850s, tourist travel to Egypt created strong demand for photographs as souvenirs. A small group of early photographers, mostly of French origin, made their way to Cairo and the Nile Valley to capitalise on this demand. These pioneering photographers included [[F\u00e9lix Bonfils]] (1831-1885); [[Gustave Le Gray]] (1820-1884), brothers Henri and Emile Bechard; the British-Italian brothers [[Antonio Beato]] (c. 1832\u20131906) and [[Felice Beato]] and the Greek [[Adelphoi Zangaki|Zangaki brothers]]. <ref>Jacobson, K.,  ''Odalisques and Arabesques: Orientalist Photography, 1839-1925,'' London,  Bernard Quaritch, 2007, p. 277.</ref> Although it is unclear when Arnoux first travelled to Egypt, he appears to have been in Egypt around the same time as this group of pioneering photographers. Some evidence points to a collaboration between Arnoux and the Zangaki Brothers, but the precise nature of any such relationship is unclear. <ref>Irini Apostolou, \"Photographes Fran\u00e7ais et Locaux en Orient M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en au XXIX si\u00e8cle: Quelques cas de collaboration,\" ''Bulletin du Centre de Recherche Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 J\u00e9rusalem,'' Vol. 24, 2013 (translated from French)</ref> \n\nArnoux is known to have established a studio in Place de Consuls in Port Said in the 1860s, and later a different studio at Place Ferdinand de Lesseps also in Port Said. <ref>Hannavy, J., ''Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography,'' Routledge, 2013, p. 73; It may be worth noting that the Zangaki Bros were also operating their studio at Port Said. </ref> He also operated a floating darkroom in Port Said in the 1860s and 70s, of which a photograph survives. <ref>Um, N., \"Bridging the Mediterranean and Gujarat with the Turn of a Page: Picturing the Dimensions of Maritime Travel in an Extra-Illustrated Nineteenth-Century Book about India,\" ''Getty Research Journal,'' 2016, p. 242</ref> He may have been the official photographer, appointed by the [[Suez Canal Company|Universal Company of the Suez Canal]], to document the work on the canal.
