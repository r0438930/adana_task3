West from this [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest, which is buried beneath the [[Dallas]]&ndash;[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]&ndash;[[Austin, Texas|Austin]]&ndash;[[San Antonio]] trend, the sediments are [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] in age. [[Petroleum|Oil]] is found in the Cretaceous sediments in the east, the Permian sediments in the west, and along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas [[continental shelf]]. A few exposures of [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s are found in the central and western parts of the state, and [[Oligocene]] [[volcanic]] rocks are found in far west Texas, in the [[Big Bend, Texas|Big Bend]] area. A blanket of [[Miocene]] sediments known as the [[Ogallala formation]] in the western high plains region is an important [[aquifer]]. Texas has no active or dormant volcanoes and few earthquakes, being situated far from an active [[plate tectonic]] boundary. The Big Bend area is the most seismically active; however, the area is sparsely populated and suffers minimal damages and injuries, and no known fatalities have been attributed to a Texas earthquake.\n\n==Resources==\nWith a large supply of [[natural resource]]s, Texas is a major [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] state, producing oil, cattle, sheep, and cotton.

West from this [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest, which is buried beneath the [[Dallas]]&ndash;[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]&ndash;[[Austin, Texas|Austin]]&ndash;[[San Antonio]] trend, the sediments are [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] in age. [[Petroleum|Oil]] is found in the Cretaceous sediments in the east, the Permian sediments in the west, and along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas [[continental shelf]]. A few exposures of [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s are found in the central and western parts of the state, and [[Oligocene]] [[volcanic]] rocks are found in far west Texas, in the [[Big Bend, Texas|Big Bend]] area. A blanket of [[Miocene]] sediments known as the [[Ogallala formation]] in the western high plains region is an important [[aquifer]]. Texas has no active or dormant volcanoes and few earthquakes, being situated far from an active [[plate tectonic]] boundary. The Big Bend area is the most seismically active; however, the area is sparsely populated and suffers minimal damages and injuries, and no known fatalities have been attributed to a Texas earthquake.\n\n==Resources==\nWith a large supply of [[natural resource]]s, Texas is a major [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] state, producing oil, cattle, sheep, and cotton.
