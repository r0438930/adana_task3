The upper {{convert|350|ft|m|1}} of the walls, constructed during the second phase 1880\u20131884, are composed of finished marble surface stones, half of which project into the walls, partially backed by finished [[granite]] stones.<ref name=Torres/>\n\nThe interior is occupied by iron stairs that spiral up the walls, with an elevator in the center, each supported by four iron columns, which do not support the stone structure. The stairs contain fifty sections, most on the north and south walls, with many long landings stretching between them along the east and west walls. These landings allowed many inscribed memorial stones of various materials and sizes to be easily viewed while the stairs were accessible (until 1976), plus one memorial stone between stairs that is difficult to view.

After his December 1799 death, the [[United States Congress]] authorized a suitable memorial in the planned national capital then under construction since 1791, but the decision was reversed when the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] (Jeffersonian Republicans) took control of Congress in 1801 after the pivotal [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 Election]], with the first change of power between opposing political parties.<ref>Sheldon S.

They also blocked his image on coins or the celebration of his birthday. Further political squabbling, along with the North\u2013South division on the Civil War, blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century. By that time, Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South, and memorials to him were no longer controversial.<ref>Kirk Savage, ''Monument Wars: Washington, D.C., the National Mall, and the Transformation of the Memorial Landscape'' (2009) pp 32\u201345</ref>\n\nAs early as 1783, the old [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]] (successors after 1781 to the earlier [[Second Continental Congress]]) had resolved \"That an equestrian statue of George Washington be erected at the place where the residence of Congress shall be established.\" The proposal called for engraving on the statue which explained it had been erected \"in honor of George Washington, the illustrious [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Armies of the United States of America during the war which vindicated and secured their liberty, sovereignty, and independence.\"<ref>George Cochrane Hazelton, ''The national capitol: its architecture, art and history'' (1902) p. 288.</ref> Currently, there are two equestrian statues of President Washington in the national capital city of Washington, D.C.

[[John Marshall]] (1755\u20131835), a [[United States Representative|Representative]] from Virginia (who later became [[Chief Justice of the United States]], 1801\u20131835) proposed that a tomb be erected within the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and it was designed later to place such a crypt sepluchar below the rotunda of the great dome.

Even though slave labor is not explicitly mentioned by Louis Torres or any other source, it would have been needed to augment the small paid labor force of skilled and unskilled workers totaling, for example, only 57 in 1849,<ref name=Torres/>{{rp|18}} compared to the peak total of 170 paid workers during the second phase of construction (1879\u20131884).<ref name=Torres/>{{rp|66}} Washington Monument Historian John Steele Gordon stated \"I can't say for certain, but the stonemasonry was pretty highly skilled, so it's unlikely that slaves would've been doing it. The stones were cut by stonecutters, which is highly skilled work; and the stones were hoisted by means of steam engines, so you'd need a skilled engineer and foreman for stuff like that. Tending the steam engine, building the cast-iron staircase inside\u2014that wasn't grunt work. ... The early quarries were in Maryland, so slave labor was undoubtedly used to quarry and haul the stone\"<ref name=Riesman>{{cite web |last=Riesman |first=Abraham |url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/07/was-the-washington-monument-built-by-slaves.html |title=So, Was the Washington Monument Built by Slaves |date=July 10, 2017 |work=Slate |access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> Abraham Riesman, who quoted Gordon, states \"there were plenty of people who worked as skilled laborers while enslaved in antebellum America. Indeed, there were enslaved people who worked as stonemasons. So the possibility remains that there were slaves who performed some of the necessary skilled labor for the monument.\"<ref name=Riesman/> According to historian Jesse Holland, it is very likely that African-American slaves were among the construction workers, given that slavery prevailed in Washington and its surrounding states at that time, and slaves were commonly used in public and private construction.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jesus|first1=Austin Elias-de|title=Spider-Man: Homecoming Says the Washington Monument Was Built by Slaves.

This includes the iron staircase which was constructed 1885\u201386. That the stonecutters in the quarry were slaves is confirmed because all quarry workers were slaves during the construction of the [[United States Capitol]] during the 1790s.<ref name=slaves>{{citation |last=Allen |first=William C. |title=History of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United States Capital |url=https://emancipation.dc.gov/publication/history-slave-laborers-construction-us-capitol |date=June 1, 2005 |publisher=Office of the Architect of the Capitol}}</ref>{{rp|5\u20136}} However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase because most of its construction only required unskilled manual labor. No information survives concerning the method used to lift stones that weighed several tons each during the first phase, whether by a manual winch or a steam engine.<ref name=Torres/>{{rp|17\u201323}} The surviving information concerning slaves that built the core of the United States Capitol during the 1790s is not much help. At the time, the [[District of Columbia (until 1871)|District of Columbia]] outside of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] was sparsely populated so the federal government rented slaves from their owners who were paid a fee for their slaves' normal daily labor. Any overtime for Sundays, holidays, and nights was paid directly to the slaves which they could use for daily needs or to save to buy their freedom.<ref name=slaves/>{{rp|9}} Conversely, the first phase of the monument was constructed by a private entity, the Washington National Monument Society, which may not have been as magnanimous as the federal government, but most information was lost during the 1850s while two Societies vied for control of the monument. Useful information concerning the use of slaves during the major expansion of the Capitol during the 1850s, nearly contemporaneous with the monument's first phase, does not exist.\n\nOnly a small number of stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of [[rubble]] held together by a large amount of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at [[#Walls|Walls]] in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The [[#Foundation|original foundation]] below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the upper [[Potomac River]] Valley. Almost all the marble stones of the first and second phases came from two Maryland quarries about {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}} north of downtown Baltimore in rural [[Baltimore County]] where stone for their first Washington Monument was obtained.\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4, 1848, the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], the same organization to which Washington belonged, laid the cornerstone (symbolically, not physically).<ref name=Harvey/>{{rp|45, 136\u2013143}} According to [[Joseph R.

At that time a memorial stone that was contributed by [[Pope Pius IX]], called the Pope's Stone, was destroyed by members of the [[anti-Catholic]], [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] American Party, better known as the \"[[Know-Nothings]]\", during the early morning hours of {{nowrap|March 6, 1854}} (a priest replaced it in 1982 using the Latin phrase \"A Roma Americae\" instead of the original stone's English phrase \"Rome to America\").

Congress immediately tabled its expected contribution of $200,000 to the Society, effectively halting the Federal appropriation. During its tenure, the Know-Nothing Society added only two courses of masonry, or four feet, to the monument using rejected masonry it found on site, increasing the height of the shaft to 156 feet. The original Society refused to recognize the takeover, so the two rival Societies existed side by side until 1858. With the Know-Nothing Party disintegrating and unable to secure contributions for the monument, it surrendered its possession of the monument to the original Society three and a half years later on {{nowrap|October 20, 1858}}.

Engineers studied the foundation several times to determine if it was strong enough. In 1876, the [[United States Centennial|American Centennial]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Congress agreed to appropriate another $200,000 to finally resume construction.<ref name=\"reeves413\">{{cite book| last = Reeves| first = Thomas C.| title = Gentleman Boss| url = https://archive.org/details/gentlemanbosslif00reev| url-access = registration| date = February 1975| publisher = Alfred A.

Many people thought a simple obelisk, one without the colonnade, would be too bare. Architect Mills was reputed to have said omitting the colonnade would make the monument look like \"a stalk of [[asparagus]]\"; another critic said it offered \"little&nbsp;... to be proud of.\"<ref name=\"wash\" />\n\n[[File:Washington-Monument-1885.png|thumb|upright|Monument plans and timeline of construction]]\nThis attitude led people to submit alternative designs. Both the Washington National Monument Society and Congress held discussions about how the monument should be finished. The Society considered five new designs, concluding that the one by [[William Wetmore Story]] (1819\u20131895), seemed \"vastly superior in artistic taste and beauty.\" Congress deliberated over those five as well as Mills's original. While it was deciding, it ordered work on the obelisk to continue. Finally, the members of the society agreed to abandon the colonnade and alter the obelisk so it conformed to classical Egyptian proportions.<ref name=nps3 />\n\n====Resumption====\nConstruction resumed in 1879 under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel [[Thomas Lincoln Casey Sr.|Thomas Lincoln Casey]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]. Casey redesigned the foundation, strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40,000 tons. The first stone atop the unfinished stump was laid August 7, 1880 in a small ceremony attended by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], Casey and a few others. The president placed a small coin on which he had scratched his initials and the date in the bed of wet cement at the 150-foot level before the first stone was laid on top of it.<ref name=Torres/>{{rp|76}} Casey found 92 memorial stones (\"presented stones\") already inlaid into the interior walls of the first phase of construction. Before construction continued he temporarily removed eight stones at the 150-foot level so that the walls at that level could be sloped outward, producing thinner second-phase walls. He inserted those stones and most of the remaining memorial stones stored in the lapidarium into the interior walls during 1885\u20131889.<ref name=Jacob/>{{rp|11\u201317}} The bottom third of the monument is a slightly lighter shade than the rest of the construction because the marble was obtained from different quarries.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc72.htm | title=Washington Monument | work=National Park Service | accessdate=March 10, 2015 | quote=The walls of the monument range in thickness from 15' at the base to 18' at the upper shaft.

The slab was {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|1}} thick, with an outer perimeter {{convert|126|ft|5+1/2|in|m|2}} square, an inner perimeter {{convert|44|ft|m|1}} square, with undisturbed loam inside the inner perimeter except for the water well. The area at the base of the second phase foundation is {{convert|15992|sqft|m2|1}}. The strengthened foundation (old foundation and concrete slab) has a total depth of {{convert|36|ft|10|in|1}} below the bottom of the lowest course of marble blocks (now below ground), and {{convert|38|ft|m|1}} below the entry lobby floor. Casey reported that nowhere did the load exceed {{convert|9|LT/sqft|psi kPa}} and did not exceed {{convert|3|LT/sqft|psi kPa}} near the outer perimeter.<ref name=Casey1884/> To properly distribute the load from the shaft to slab, about half by volume of the outer periphery of the old rubble foundation below its top step was removed. A continuous sloping unreinforced concrete buttress encircles what remains. The buttress is {{convert|100|ft|4|in|m|1}} square at its base, {{convert|64|ft|6|in|m|1}} square at its top, and {{convert|20|ft|5|in|m|1}} high. The perimeter of the original top step of the old rubble foundation rests on the larger top of the concrete buttress. Its slope (lower external angle from the vertical) is 49\u00b0. This buttress rests in a depression (triangular cross-section) on the top surface of the concrete slab. The slab was constructed by digging pairs of {{convert|4|ft|m|1|adj=on}} wide [[drift mining|drift]]s on opposite sides of the monument's center line to keep the monument properly balanced. The drifts were filled with unreinforced concrete with depressions or dowel stones on their sides to interlock the sections.<ref name=HSR/>{{rp|3{{hyphen}}3{{ndash}}3{{hyphen}}5, figs 3.1{{ndash}}3.6, 3.9, 3.13, 4.11}}<ref name=Torres/>{{rp|39, 47{{ndash}}48, 67{{ndash}}73}} An earthen terrace {{convert|60|ft|m|0}} wide with its top at the base of the walls and steep sides was constructed in 1880\u201381 over the reinforced foundation while the rest of the monument was being constructed. During 1887\u201388, a knoll was constructed around the terrace tapering out roughly {{convert|300|ft|m|-1}} onto the surrounding terrain. This earthen terrace and knoll serves as an additional buttress for the foundation.

It was redesigned in 1958 to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors. Originally, visitors entered and exited the west side of the elevator on the observation floor, causing congestion. So the large landing at the 490-foot level was expanded to a full floor and the original spiral stair in the northeast corner between the 490- and 500-foot levels was replaced by two spiral stairs in the northeast and southeast corners. Now visitors exit the elevator on the observation floor, then walk down either spiral stair before reboarding the elevator for their trip back down.<ref name=HSR/>{{rp|fig 3.31}}\n\nThe main stairs spiral up the interior walls from the entry lobby floor to the elevator reboarding floor at the 490-foot level.

Three stairs with small landings rise from the entry lobby floor to the 30-foot level successively along the north, west and south interior walls. Landings from the 30-foot level up to the 150-foot level are {{convert|3|ft|2+1/4|in|m|2}} by {{convert|25|ft|1|in|m|2}}, while landings from the 160-foot level to the 480-foot level are {{convert|7|ft|10+3/4|in|m|2}} by {{convert|31|ft|5+1/2|in|m|2}}. All stairs are on the north and south walls except for the aforementioned west stair between the 10- and 20-foot levels, and the two spiral stairs.\n\nAbout one fourth of visitors chose to ascend the monument using the stairs when they were available.

Further political squabbling, along with the North\u2013South division on the Civil War, blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century.

[[John Marshall]] (1755\u20131835), a [[United States Representative|Representative]] from Virginia (who later became [[Chief Justice of the United States]], 1801\u20131835) proposed that a tomb be erected within the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and it was designed later to place such a crypt sepluchar below the rotunda of the great dome. However, a lack of funds, disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country's first president, and the Washington family's reluctance to move his body from [[Mount Vernon]] prevented progress on any project.<ref name=\"wash\">{{cite news\n| url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/62wash/62wash.htm\n| publisher=National Park Service, ParkNet\n| title=The Washington Monument: Tribute in Stone }}</ref>\n\n===Design===\n[[File:LCCN2003656330 Design of the National Washington Monument in the City of Washington cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Print of the proposed Washington Monument by architect [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]] (1781\u20131855), Proposed Plan circa 1845\u20131848]]\nProgress toward a memorial finally began in 1833.

Mills' Baltimore monument with cornerstone laid and construction begun the following year of 1815, was however later simplified to a plain column shaft with a statue of a toga-clad Washington at the top when it was completed in 1829, but moved because of its height to the then [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|rural hills north]] beyond the waterfront town awaiting the city's growth to catch up.

Even though slave labor is not explicitly mentioned by Louis Torres or any other source, it would have been needed to augment the small paid labor force of skilled and unskilled workers totaling, for example, only 57 in 1849,<ref name=Torres/>{{rp|18}} compared to the peak total of 170 paid workers during the second phase of construction (1879\u20131884).<ref name=Torres/>{{rp|66}} Washington Monument Historian John Steele Gordon stated \"I can't say for certain, but the stonemasonry was pretty highly skilled, so it's unlikely that slaves would've been doing it. The stones were cut by stonecutters, which is highly skilled work; and the stones were hoisted by means of steam engines, so you'd need a skilled engineer and foreman for stuff like that.

The early quarries were in Maryland, so slave labor was undoubtedly used to quarry and haul the stone\"<ref name=Riesman>{{cite web |last=Riesman |first=Abraham |url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/07/was-the-washington-monument-built-by-slaves.html |title=So, Was the Washington Monument Built by Slaves |date=July 10, 2017 |work=Slate |access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> Abraham Riesman, who quoted Gordon, states \"there were plenty of people who worked as skilled laborers while enslaved in antebellum America. Indeed, there were enslaved people who worked as stonemasons. So the possibility remains that there were slaves who performed some of the necessary skilled labor for the monument.\"<ref name=Riesman/> According to historian Jesse Holland, it is very likely that African-American slaves were among the construction workers, given that slavery prevailed in Washington and its surrounding states at that time, and slaves were commonly used in public and private construction.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jesus|first1=Austin Elias-de|title=Spider-Man: Homecoming Says the Washington Monument Was Built by Slaves.

This includes the iron staircase which was constructed 1885\u201386. That the stonecutters in the quarry were slaves is confirmed because all quarry workers were slaves during the construction of the [[United States Capitol]] during the 1790s.<ref name=slaves>{{citation |last=Allen |first=William C. |title=History of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United States Capital |url=https://emancipation.dc.gov/publication/history-slave-laborers-construction-us-capitol |date=June 1, 2005 |publisher=Office of the Architect of the Capitol}}</ref>{{rp|5\u20136}} However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase because most of its construction only required unskilled manual labor. No information survives concerning the method used to lift stones that weighed several tons each during the first phase, whether by a manual winch or a steam engine.<ref name=Torres/>{{rp|17\u201323}} The surviving information concerning slaves that built the core of the United States Capitol during the 1790s is not much help. At the time, the [[District of Columbia (until 1871)|District of Columbia]] outside of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] was sparsely populated so the federal government rented slaves from their owners who were paid a fee for their slaves' normal daily labor. Any overtime for Sundays, holidays, and nights was paid directly to the slaves which they could use for daily needs or to save to buy their freedom.<ref name=slaves/>{{rp|9}} Conversely, the first phase of the monument was constructed by a private entity, the Washington National Monument Society, which may not have been as magnanimous as the federal government, but most information was lost during the 1850s while two Societies vied for control of the monument. Useful information concerning the use of slaves during the major expansion of the Capitol during the 1850s, nearly contemporaneous with the monument's first phase, does not exist.\n\nOnly a small number of stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of [[rubble]] held together by a large amount of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at [[#Walls|Walls]] in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The [[#Foundation|original foundation]] below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the upper [[Potomac River]] Valley. Almost all the marble stones of the first and second phases came from two Maryland quarries about {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}} north of downtown Baltimore in rural [[Baltimore County]] where stone for their first Washington Monument was obtained.\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4, 1848, the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], the same organization to which Washington belonged, laid the cornerstone (symbolically, not physically).<ref name=Harvey/>{{rp|45, 136\u2013143}} According to [[Joseph R.

During its tenure, the Know-Nothing Society added only two courses of masonry, or four feet, to the monument using rejected masonry it found on site, increasing the height of the shaft to 156 feet. The original Society refused to recognize the takeover, so the two rival Societies existed side by side until 1858. With the Know-Nothing Party disintegrating and unable to secure contributions for the monument, it surrendered its possession of the monument to the original Society three and a half years later on {{nowrap|October 20, 1858}}.

Many people thought a simple obelisk, one without the colonnade, would be too bare.

While it was deciding, it ordered work on the obelisk to continue. Finally, the members of the society agreed to abandon the colonnade and alter the obelisk so it conformed to classical Egyptian proportions.<ref name=nps3 />\n\n====Resumption====\nConstruction resumed in 1879 under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel [[Thomas Lincoln Casey Sr.|Thomas Lincoln Casey]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]. Casey redesigned the foundation, strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40,000 tons. The first stone atop the unfinished stump was laid August 7, 1880 in a small ceremony attended by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], Casey and a few others. The president placed a small coin on which he had scratched his initials and the date in the bed of wet cement at the 150-foot level before the first stone was laid on top of it.<ref name=Torres/>{{rp|76}} Casey found 92 memorial stones (\"presented stones\") already inlaid into the interior walls of the first phase of construction.

The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.<ref name=screening>[http://www.ncpc.gov/DocumentDepot/Actions_Recommendations/2014March/Washington_Monument_Visitor_Screening_Facility_Recommendation_6176_March2014_.pdf National Park Service and National Capital Planning Commission. \"Visitor Screening Facility, Washington Monument Between 14th and 17th Streets, NW and Constitution Avenue, NW and the Tidal Basin.\" Executive Director's Recommendation.
