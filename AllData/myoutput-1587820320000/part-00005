The film takes the Harper family on a 23-year journey.\n\nEunice appeared occasionally on \"The Family\" skit's [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]''. As portrayed by Carol Burnett, Eunice was in five episodes of ''Mama's Family'', all of which were in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1, 2)|first life of ''Mama's Family'']] on [[NBC]]. Four of Burnett's five appearances were in season 1. The fifth episode of season 2 (\"Rashomama\"), which aired on November 3, 1983, was Burnett's final portrayal of Eunice. The character made two subsequent appearances in flashback episodes. Tanya Fenmore played Eunice as a child in the nineteenth episode of season 2 (\"Mama's Birthday).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640588/</ref> This marked the character's final appearance in the first life of the sitcom.\n\nEunice appeared only once during the [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life of ''Mama's Family'']] (originally in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]]). The character's final appearance was in the fourteenth episode of season 4 (\"The Sins of the Mother\"), portrayed as a teenager by Heather Kerr.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640615/</ref> Eunice is presented once more in voice only in the final episode of season 4 (\"Pomp and Circumstance\"); Eunice, voiced by Phyllis Franklin, spoke to Mama over the phone to inform her that she couldn't attend her son Bubba's high school [[graduation]]. She declined to explain her reasons to Bubba, hanging up when Mama threatened to put him on the phone.\n\nAlways clad in a tattered green dress and wearing her hair in a 1940s-era perm, Eunice is a working-class homemaker married to Ed Higgins. Eunice had a stormy, irrepressible, browbeating persona, always going melodramatically out of control, ranting and raving. However, especially on ''The Family'' sketches, Eunice was beaten down by her tyrannical, emotionally-abusive mother, and her fits of rage were usually provoked by her mother's passive-aggressive comments. Her character was portrayed as a jealous antagonist in her appearances on ''Mama's Family'', much more so than her appearances on ''The Family'' sketches.
