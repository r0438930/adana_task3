Thus the presence of originally [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking and later [[Eastern Aramaic]]-speaking Assyrians in the northeastern part of the modern country dates back over 4000 years, where they originally lived alongside a diverse set of other peoples such as [[Hittites]], [[Hurrians]] and [[Amorites]] throughout the ages. Traces of the long era of Assyrian settlement can be seen at numerous archaeological sites across the region. Important Assyrian cities in the region in ancient times included; [[Til-Barsip]], [[Carchemish]], [[Guzana]], [[Shubat-Enlil]] and [[Dur-Katlimmu]].\n\nThe north east of Syria was a part of [[Achaemenid Assyria]] ([[Athura]]) between 546 and 332 BC, then to [[Seleucid Syria]] (312-150 BC), when the name ''Syria'' which was originally a 9th-century BC [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] corruption of ''Assyria'' and had hitherto referred only to [[Assyria]] itself, also became applied to a region long known as [[Aramea]]/[[Eber Nari]] - in other words what is today modern Syria. During the [[Parthian Empire]] (150 BC-224 AD) and early [[Sassanid Empire]] (224 -650 AD) (when the land was renamed [[Assuristan]]) a number of [[Neo-Assyrian]] kingdoms arose, and parts of north east Syria became a part of the Neo-Assyrian state of [[Osroene]] until the mid 3rd century AD. [[Christianity]] became established amongst the Assyrians as early as the 1st century AD, and the region of [[Athura]] became the birthplace of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] and [[Syriac literature]], with the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] being founded in the region.\n\nAfter the [[Arab]] [[Islamic Conquest]] of the mid 7th century AD, Assyria/Athura/Assuristan was dissolved as a geo-political entity, and the region gradually saw an influx of [[Muslim]] [[Arabic]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Iranic]] peoples. However, settlement in the northeastern areas often proved unsustainable in the long-term, leading to numerous episodes of population exodus. In addition to experiencing such destabilising factors such as climate shifts and over-cultivation of land, the area was also vulnerable to attack from nomadic peoples. Following the Mongol and [[Timur]]id invasions and subsequent massacre of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], it was left with only a scant permanent population. In the centuries that followed, a number of nomadic and semi-nomadic Arabic- and Kurdish-speaking tribes wandered the area with their livestock into the 20th century, when most of them were forced to settle by governmental policies.\n\nWhen Turkey conducted ethnic cleansing against its Christian populations, Kurds were responsible for most of the atrocities against Assyrians.<ref>Joan A.

Given preferential treatment on the basis of their [[Christianity|Christian]] religion by the French, they soon formed most of the new urban elite in the region. An additional influx of Eastern Assyrians began to resettle along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] in 1933 after the massacres of Assyrians in newly-independent Iraq (see [[Simele massacre]]) forced the flight. These were refugees twice over\u2014originally from the highlands of [[Hakkari]], they had initially sought refuge amongst other Assyrians in Iraq in the face of the [[Assyrian genocide]] before the attacks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/05/rights-assyrians-face-escalating-abuses-in-new-iraq/|title=RIGHTS: Assyrians Face Escalating Abuses in \"New Iraq\" &#124; Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|Assyrian refugees travelling to Khabur after escaping the Simele Massacre]]\nIn 1936, religious and political leaders\u2014mainly from the Assyrian and Armenian Christian and Kurdish communities, with a few Arab groups as well\u2014pressured the French authorities to give autonomous status to the Syrian [[Al-Jazira province]] (nowadays the [[Al-Hasakah Governorate|Al Hasakah]]) for its mixed-ethnic population, like in the [[Hatay Province|Sanjak of Alexandretta]], the [[Alawite State]], or [[Jabal al-Druze]]. The push for autonomy was marked by civil strife and inter-communal violence in the province, and angry hostility on the part of the mainly Arab nationalists pushing for outright independence for Syria. Long having viewed the settlement of Assyrians and Armenians in the country as the product of French colonialism, they were further incensed by the arrival of additional Assyrian refugees on the Khabur, and mobilized support from many Arab tribes and some Kurdish groups to counter the autonomists. The French forcibly cracked down on both sides as they grew increasingly violent, and the movement for autonomy soon failed. Later on, in 1957, the [[Assyrian Democratic Organization]] was set up in [[Syria]] by center-left intellectuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.ado-world.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724224229/http://en.ado-world.org/ |archive-date=2011-07-24 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThough officially and incorrectly designated as ''Arabs'' by the Syrian Arab Nationalist [[Baathist]] government, the Assyrians are a distinct pre-Arab ethnic group with a history in the region dating perhaps as far back as the 25th century BC.

The French established this Assyrian settlement with the assistance of the League of Nations, and in 1942 it became an integral part of Syria. The Assyrian settlement on the Khabur valley consists of about 20 villages, primarily agricultural.

These range from military groups to police forces concentrated in the Al-Hasakah Governorate, mainly in Qamishli and Khabur. These militias include:\n\n====Gozarto Protection Force====\n\n[[Gozarto Protection Force]] (GPF), or Sootoro, are a light infantry militia formed in 2012 that are aligned to the [[Syrian Government]]. The militia is composed mainly of Assyrians, with a smaller number of Armenians in the group.

MFS have been involved in numerous offensives alongside the YPG, as well as in Iraq (Nineveh & Sinjar). The [[Bethnahrain Women's Protection Forces]] are the female brigade of the MFS and assume guard roles in the Assyrian communities of northeast Syria.\n\n====Sutoro====\n\n[[Sutoro]] are the police wing of the Syriac Military Council and have been active in Syria from 2012 onwards. Sutoro police the Assyrian communities of northeast Syria, as well as working in concert with Asayish to safeguard the region.\n\n====Khabour Guards====\n\n[[Khabour Guards]], as well as [[Nattoreh]] are a militia tied to the Assyrian Democratic Party and are active in the Khabur Valley of Syria. Founded in 2012, Khabour Guards have been involved in SDF campaigns and in 2019, merged with the Syriac Military Council to form the Syriac-Assyrian Military Council.\n\n===Clashes with Kurdish Forces===\n\nThe main group aligned with the Assad-government are the [[Sootoro]] forces stationed in northeast Syria. In early 2016, Sootoro forces set up checkpoints in the Assyrian-controlled districts of Qamishli due to increasing terrorist attacks targeting Assyrians in the city. Members of Asayish, the security-wing of the YPG, approached the checkpoints and demanded they be dismantled.

Thus the presence of originally [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking and later [[Eastern Aramaic]]-speaking Assyrians in the northeastern part of the modern country dates back over 4000 years, where they originally lived alongside a diverse set of other peoples such as [[Hittites]], [[Hurrians]] and [[Amorites]] throughout the ages. Traces of the long era of Assyrian settlement can be seen at numerous archaeological sites across the region. Important Assyrian cities in the region in ancient times included; [[Til-Barsip]], [[Carchemish]], [[Guzana]], [[Shubat-Enlil]] and [[Dur-Katlimmu]].\n\nThe north east of Syria was a part of [[Achaemenid Assyria]] ([[Athura]]) between 546 and 332 BC, then to [[Seleucid Syria]] (312-150 BC), when the name ''Syria'' which was originally a 9th-century BC [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] corruption of ''Assyria'' and had hitherto referred only to [[Assyria]] itself, also became applied to a region long known as [[Aramea]]/[[Eber Nari]] - in other words what is today modern Syria. During the [[Parthian Empire]] (150 BC-224 AD) and early [[Sassanid Empire]] (224 -650 AD) (when the land was renamed [[Assuristan]]) a number of [[Neo-Assyrian]] kingdoms arose, and parts of north east Syria became a part of the Neo-Assyrian state of [[Osroene]] until the mid 3rd century AD. [[Christianity]] became established amongst the Assyrians as early as the 1st century AD, and the region of [[Athura]] became the birthplace of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] and [[Syriac literature]], with the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] being founded in the region.\n\nAfter the [[Arab]] [[Islamic Conquest]] of the mid 7th century AD, Assyria/Athura/Assuristan was dissolved as a geo-political entity, and the region gradually saw an influx of [[Muslim]] [[Arabic]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Iranic]] peoples. However, settlement in the northeastern areas often proved unsustainable in the long-term, leading to numerous episodes of population exodus. In addition to experiencing such destabilising factors such as climate shifts and over-cultivation of land, the area was also vulnerable to attack from nomadic peoples. Following the Mongol and [[Timur]]id invasions and subsequent massacre of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], it was left with only a scant permanent population. In the centuries that followed, a number of nomadic and semi-nomadic Arabic- and Kurdish-speaking tribes wandered the area with their livestock into the 20th century, when most of them were forced to settle by governmental policies.\n\nWhen Turkey conducted ethnic cleansing against its Christian populations, Kurds were responsible for most of the atrocities against Assyrians.<ref>Joan A.

Given preferential treatment on the basis of their [[Christianity|Christian]] religion by the French, they soon formed most of the new urban elite in the region. An additional influx of Eastern Assyrians began to resettle along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] in 1933 after the massacres of Assyrians in newly-independent Iraq (see [[Simele massacre]]) forced the flight. These were refugees twice over\u2014originally from the highlands of [[Hakkari]], they had initially sought refuge amongst other Assyrians in Iraq in the face of the [[Assyrian genocide]] before the attacks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/05/rights-assyrians-face-escalating-abuses-in-new-iraq/|title=RIGHTS: Assyrians Face Escalating Abuses in \"New Iraq\" &#124; Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Assyrian refugees on wagon.jpg|thumb|Assyrian refugees travelling to Khabur after escaping the Simele Massacre]]\nIn 1936, religious and political leaders\u2014mainly from the Assyrian and Armenian Christian and Kurdish communities, with a few Arab groups as well\u2014pressured the French authorities to give autonomous status to the Syrian [[Al-Jazira province]] (nowadays the [[Al-Hasakah Governorate|Al Hasakah]]) for its mixed-ethnic population, like in the [[Hatay Province|Sanjak of Alexandretta]], the [[Alawite State]], or [[Jabal al-Druze]]. The push for autonomy was marked by civil strife and inter-communal violence in the province, and angry hostility on the part of the mainly Arab nationalists pushing for outright independence for Syria. Long having viewed the settlement of Assyrians and Armenians in the country as the product of French colonialism, they were further incensed by the arrival of additional Assyrian refugees on the Khabur, and mobilized support from many Arab tribes and some Kurdish groups to counter the autonomists. The French forcibly cracked down on both sides as they grew increasingly violent, and the movement for autonomy soon failed.

The party has positioned itself with the Kurdish [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|PYD]] and is opposed to the Ba'ath government of Syria. They are currently represented as part of the [[TEV-DEM]] coalition and possess 3 seats in the [[Syrian Democratic Council]].\n\n==Syrian Civil War==\n\nAssyrians have been caught between different political sides from the onset of the [[Syrian Civil War]] with some Assyrian groups allying with the [[Syrian Government]] and others with the Kurdish-led [[Syrian Democratic Forces]].\n\n===Assyrian militias===\n\nWith the onset of the [[Syrian Civil War]], Assyrians have formed numerous military forces in order to protect their communities. These range from military groups to police forces concentrated in the Al-Hasakah Governorate, mainly in Qamishli and Khabur. These militias include:\n\n====Gozarto Protection Force====\n\n[[Gozarto Protection Force]] (GPF), or Sootoro, are a light infantry militia formed in 2012 that are aligned to the [[Syrian Government]]. The militia is composed mainly of Assyrians, with a smaller number of Armenians in the group. GPF mainly clash with ISIL, although they have also been involved in clashes with Kurdish forces stationed nearby.\n\n====Syriac Military Council====\n\nThe [[Syriac Military Council]] (MFS) are a militia of the Dawronoye ideology that are a component of the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF) and under the Syriac Union Party. MFS have been involved in numerous offensives alongside the YPG, as well as in Iraq (Nineveh & Sinjar). The [[Bethnahrain Women's Protection Forces]] are the female brigade of the MFS and assume guard roles in the Assyrian communities of northeast Syria.\n\n====Sutoro====\n\n[[Sutoro]] are the police wing of the Syriac Military Council and have been active in Syria from 2012 onwards. Sutoro police the Assyrian communities of northeast Syria, as well as working in concert with Asayish to safeguard the region.\n\n====Khabour Guards====\n\n[[Khabour Guards]], as well as [[Nattoreh]] are a militia tied to the Assyrian Democratic Party and are active in the Khabur Valley of Syria. Founded in 2012, Khabour Guards have been involved in SDF campaigns and in 2019, merged with the Syriac Military Council to form the Syriac-Assyrian Military Council.\n\n===Clashes with Kurdish Forces===\n\nThe main group aligned with the Assad-government are the [[Sootoro]] forces stationed in northeast Syria. In early 2016, Sootoro forces set up checkpoints in the Assyrian-controlled districts of Qamishli due to increasing terrorist attacks targeting Assyrians in the city. Members of Asayish, the security-wing of the YPG, approached the checkpoints and demanded they be dismantled. When Sootoro refused, Asayish fired at Sootoro soldiers, causing several casualties on both sides.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Al Rifai |first1=Diana |title=Assyrians and Kurds clash for first time in north Syria |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/assyrians-kurds-qamishli-160112165041894.html |website=Al-Jazeera |accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Isaac |first1=Mardean |title=Under Fire From All Sides: Syria\u2019s Assyrians |url=https://www.newsdeeply.com/syria/community/2016/06/03/under-fire-from-all-sides-syrias-assyrians |website=NewsDeeply |accessdate=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Persecution by ISIL===\n{{See also|Human rights in ISIL-controlled territory|2015 Qamishli bombings}} \nThe [[Syrian Civil War]] initially put much strain on Assyrians in Syria.
