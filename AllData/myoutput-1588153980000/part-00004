The idea for the system came from Murphy and the Dewaele brother's dissatisfaction with the evolution of [[DJ]] culture and how DJing has become more of a \u201cshow-spectacle-type scenario\u201d and has departed from the days of people dancing in the dark with little attention to the DJ. The design is \u201cdesigned for really immersive listening\u201d. The reason behind creating and performing with Despacio is to encourage DJs to implement a similar sound system, altering the course of DJ culture to its dance roots.<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{Cite web|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/james-murphy-on-despacio-lcd-soundsystems-live-album-and-new-music-20131211|title = James Murphy on Despacio, LCD Soundsystem's Live Album and New Music|date = December 11, 2013|accessdate = |website = rollingstone.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n=== Subway Symphony ===\nJames Murphy has been attempting to change the sound of the New York [[turnstile]] beeps since 1999. Murphy has described the current turnstile sound as of 2014 as a \u201cdissonant rubbing-Styrofoam-on-glass squeak\u201d that is \u201chorrible\u201d. Because the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metropolitan Transit Authority]] plans to update the system by 2019, Murphy has proposed his turnstile plan that would have each turnstile harmonize with others by emitting three-to-five note sequences. Installing new sound chips will be an easier task during the renovations. Murphy feels that the more pleasant sounds will also help people's attitudes toward taking the subway. He believes that people will \"feel a nostalgia\" for certain destinations when hearing its unique melody.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/25/lcd-soundsystem-james-murphy-soundtrack-new-york-subways|title = NYC Soundsystem: James Murphy in bid to create soundtrack for subways|date = February 25, 2014|accessdate = |website = theguardian.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Murphy is prepared for the responsibilities if the idea is green-lit by the MTA and would be \u201cbroken hearted [if it doesn\u2019t happen]\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/james-murphy-wants-to-make-nyc-subway-turnstiles-more-musical-20140224|title = James Murphy Wants to Make NYC Subway Turnstiles More Musical|date = February 24, 2014|accessdate = |website = rollingstone.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, he partnered with [[Heineken]] to launch the project, branded as the \u201cSubway Symphony.\u201d However, the MTA has denied any possibility of the project happening, as the standard turnstile beep is a necessary [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]]-compliant tool for the visually impaired.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Even This Beer Company Can't Save James Murphy's Subway Dream|url = http://gothamist.com/2015/06/11/james_murphy_subway_symphony.php|website = Gothamist|accessdate = 2015-06-15|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150615195613/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/11/james_murphy_subway_symphony.php|archivedate = 2015-06-15}}</ref>\n\n=== 2014 US Open Remixes ===\nCollaborating with [[IBM]], James Murphy \u201cremixed\u201d the 2014 [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] matches.
