Born and raised in [[Alabama]], he was a highly regarded quarterback in high school and led his team to the state championship as a junior. Winston played college football for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State Seminoles]] and as a redshirt freshman became the youngest player to win the [[Heisman Trophy]] and helped lead the Seminoles to a victory in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]]. In his sophomore and final year, the Seminoles advanced to the [[2015 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], part of the College Football Playoff. Winston also played on [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State's baseball]] team. Winston was drafted as the [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first overall pick]] by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the [[2015 NFL Draft]].\n\nAfter throwing a pick-six on his first career throw, he set franchise rookie records in several categories, including passing touchdowns, and became just the third rookie in NFL history to throw for over 4,000 yards. Over the next four seasons he continued to set career highs and franchise records, and in 2019 led the league in passing yards, completions, and attempts. However he also led the league in interceptions and total turnovers, and set an NFL record for pick-sixes thrown in a season (seven), including one on his final throw of the year. Following the season the Bucs chose not to re-sign Winston, and he signed a one-year deal with the Saints to be [[Drew Brees]]' backup.\n\n==Early life==\nWinston was born in [[Bessemer, Alabama|Bessemer]], Alabama on January 6, 1994.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.seminoles.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jameis_winston_807027.html|title=Jameis Winston Bio|publisher=Seminoles.com|accessdate=January 23, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102163116/http://www.seminoles.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jameis_winston_807027.html|archivedate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> He attended [[Hueytown High School]], where he played both [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]].<ref name=FamousJameis>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/football/story/_/id/7919785/two-sport-phenom-jameis-winston-bright-future-football-baseball |title=Famous Jameis |publisher=ESPN|date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206040830/http://espn.go.com/high-school/football/story/_/id/7919785/two-sport-phenom-jameis-winston-bright-future-football-baseball |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> Winston was considered the best [[Quarterback#Dual-threat quarterbacks|dual-threat quarterback]] recruit in the nation by [[Rivals.com]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Jameis-Winston-102384 |title=Rivals.com |website=[[Rivals.com]] |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archivedate=December 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209060948/http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Jameis-Winston-102384 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> the best overall quarterback recruit by [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/107569/jameis-winston|title=Jameis Winston ESPN recruiting profile|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> Winston was also named the MVP of the [[ESPN RISE Elite 11]] quarterback camp.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/6794915/trio-share-mvp-honors-elite-11 |title=Trio share MVP honors at Elite 11 |publisher=ESPN |date=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025839/http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/6794915/trio-share-mvp-honors-elite-11 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Winegarner|first=Mark|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9961573/florida-state-quarterback-jameis-winston-stellar-rise-fame-espn-magazine|title=Is this kid serious?|publisher=ESPN|date=November 12, 2013|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, Winston earned the Gatorade Player of the Year recognition for the state of Alabama.<ref name=FamousJameis/> He led Hueytown to a state championship during his junior year.\n\nWinston committed to attend [[Florida State University]] on February 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|author=Coley Harvey |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-02-03/sports/os-jameis-winston-florida-state-signs-0204-20120203_1_taiwan-easterling-jimbo-fisher-fsu |title=Jameis Winston finally signs with FSU |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=February 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022063147/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-02-03/sports/os-jameis-winston-florida-state-signs-0204-20120203_1_taiwan-easterling-jimbo-fisher-fsu |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> The [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] selected Winston in the 15th round of the [[2012 Major League Baseball Draft]] out of high school.

Orleans Saints]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). Born and raised in [[Alabama]], he was a highly regarded quarterback in high school and led his team to the state championship as a junior. Winston played college football for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State Seminoles]] and as a redshirt freshman became the youngest player to win the [[Heisman Trophy]] and helped lead the Seminoles to a victory in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]]. In his sophomore and final year, the Seminoles advanced to the [[2015 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], part of the College Football Playoff. Winston also played on [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State's baseball]] team. Winston was drafted as the [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first overall pick]] by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the [[2015 NFL Draft]].\n\nAfter throwing a pick-six on his first career throw, he set franchise rookie records in several categories, including passing touchdowns, and became just the third rookie in NFL history to throw for over 4,000 yards. Over the next four seasons he continued to set career highs and franchise records, and in 2019 led the league in passing yards, completions, and attempts. However he also led the league in interceptions and total turnovers, and set an NFL record for pick-sixes thrown in a season (seven), including one on his final throw of the year. Following the season the Bucs chose not to re-sign Winston, and he signed a one-year deal with the Saints to be [[Drew Brees]]' backup.\n\n==Early life==\nWinston was born in [[Bessemer, Alabama|Bessemer]], Alabama on January 6, 1994.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.seminoles.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jameis_winston_807027.html|title=Jameis Winston Bio|publisher=Seminoles.com|accessdate=January 23, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102163116/http://www.seminoles.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jameis_winston_807027.html|archivedate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> He attended [[Hueytown High School]], where he played both [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]].<ref name=FamousJameis>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/football/story/_/id/7919785/two-sport-phenom-jameis-winston-bright-future-football-baseball |title=Famous Jameis |publisher=ESPN|date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206040830/http://espn.go.com/high-school/football/story/_/id/7919785/two-sport-phenom-jameis-winston-bright-future-football-baseball |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> Winston was considered the best [[Quarterback#Dual-threat quarterbacks|dual-threat quarterback]] recruit in the nation by [[Rivals.com]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Jameis-Winston-102384 |title=Rivals.com |website=[[Rivals.com]] |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archivedate=December 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209060948/http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Jameis-Winston-102384 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> the best overall quarterback recruit by [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/107569/jameis-winston|title=Jameis Winston ESPN recruiting profile|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> Winston was also named the MVP of the [[ESPN RISE Elite 11]] quarterback camp.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/6794915/trio-share-mvp-honors-elite-11 |title=Trio share MVP honors at Elite 11 |publisher=ESPN |date=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025839/http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/6794915/trio-share-mvp-honors-elite-11 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Winegarner|first=Mark|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9961573/florida-state-quarterback-jameis-winston-stellar-rise-fame-espn-magazine|title=Is this kid serious?|publisher=ESPN|date=November 12, 2013|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, Winston earned the Gatorade Player of the Year recognition for the state of Alabama.<ref name=FamousJameis/> He led Hueytown to a state championship during his junior year.\n\nWinston committed to attend [[Florida State University]] on February 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|author=Coley Harvey |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-02-03/sports/os-jameis-winston-florida-state-signs-0204-20120203_1_taiwan-easterling-jimbo-fisher-fsu |title=Jameis Winston finally signs with FSU |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=February 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022063147/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-02-03/sports/os-jameis-winston-florida-state-signs-0204-20120203_1_taiwan-easterling-jimbo-fisher-fsu |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> The [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] selected Winston in the 15th round of the [[2012 Major League Baseball Draft]] out of high school.
