It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\nApple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020.

Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\nApple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n===Musical style===\nThe album's sound is defined by percussion.

The unpredictable songs feature looped sections, sudden stops and tempo changes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\".<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> It has been noted as less melancholy than Apple's past work, with the uptempo songs being described as \"funny, angry, and at times triumphant\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> The album features frequent improvisation, as well as background noise such as the barking of dogs, largely as a result of its home recording. Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates \"a [[rapper]]\u2019s sense that words can be music\",<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> while ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Laura Barton]] highlighted the intimacy of Apple's vocals: \"half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that \"whether she\u2019s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nThe album defies genre categorisation, and critics have noted its originality.<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-homemade-insight-of-fetch-the-bolt-cutters|title=The Homemade Insight of Fiona Apple\u2019s \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\"|last=Battan|first=Carrie|date=April 18, 2020|website=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Nevertheless, it has been compared to the works of [[Joni Mitchell]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Tom Waits]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Nina Simone]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/> and [[Kate Bush]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> who is quoted on the title track.<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\n===Lyrics and themes===\nLyrically, Apple identified the album's main theme as \"not being afraid to speak,\"<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> with Barton similarly recognising \"a refusal to be silenced\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that \"it's about breaking out of whatever prison you\u2019ve allowed yourself to live in,\" and pinpointing the message as: \"Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\u2019re in\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Pareles found that the album explored \"both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles, [Apple's] own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The album explores freedom,<ref name=\"Observer\"/> with Breihan writing that \"we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> The album has also been identified as Apple's most humorous album.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> and the album features Apple trying to make peace \"the sorts of women that society has always deemed her 'competition'\", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Apple summarised this idea as \"not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> [[Epic Records]] had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the [[impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage|coronavirus pandemic]].

Apple sent him a photo she had taken of herself \"two or three\" years earlier, and saved as a potential cover photo. On the choice of photograph, she commented: \"That face is very much me. I just wanted to be like, 'Hey, guess what? I\u2019m back! Here are some songs. Want to listen to the music, huh? Hi, hi, hi, hi.'\"<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nThe title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.2/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]] |accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.
