The character's first full appearance was in ''Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers'' #3 (March 1982), published by [[Pacific Comics]]. After Pacific published two issues, the character was published by Adams' own company [[Continuity Comics]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMs. Mystic is a genuine [[Witchcraft|witch]] who was burned at the stake during the [[Salem witch trials]] (1692\u20131695).  Her soul transferred to another plane, and returned to Earth in the modern world.  She is strongly concerned with environmental issues.  Mystic has long white hair down to her ankles, wears a set of golden spirals in her hair which resemble the insect-antenna of [[Fairy|faeries]], and her costume is basically a black [[spandex]] [[catsuit]] created with [[Screentone|Zip-A-Tone]].\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMs. Mystic is a magician; her ability to wield magic also gives her the power of flight, the ability to summon a sword of light, and undefined \"Elemental powers.\"  \n\nShe can also call upon [[Mother Nature]] for assistance. Ms. Mystic once called upon [[Mother Nature]] for help, and she responded by creating the superhero team [[Urth 4]].  Urth 4 are strongly influenced by the [[Fantastic Four]]: a group of four superheroes based on the four classical Greek elements.\n\n==Controversy over co-creation==\nIn 1993 comics artist [[Michael Netzer]] sued Neal Adams for credit and misappropriation of a jointly created property, claiming that he initially conceived the character of Ms. Mystic at the behest of [[DC Comics]]' art director [[Vince Colletta]] in 1977, and went on to co-create the character with Adams.<ref>Newswatch: \"Adams Sued for $20 Million in Libel/Trademark Suit,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #162 (Oct. 1993), pp. 7\u201311</ref>  The suit was subsequently dismissed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] on grounds of the [[Statute of Limitations]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140304232052/http://www.earthx.org/flex/994389.html Netzer v.
