The \"tribe\" is subdivided into kinship groups, each of which is a [[khel (clan)|''khel'']] and [[zai (tribe)|''zai'']].

Every Pashtun tribe is then divide into subtribes, also called [[khel (clan)|''khel'']] or [[zai (tribe)|''zai'']]. ''Zai'' in Pashto means \"descendant\". In [[Avestan]] it is similar to Pashto \"Zoi\" meaning son or offspring. [[William Crooke]] has said that ''khel'' is from an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word meaning \"association\" or \"company\".<ref>Crooke, William (1896) ''The Tribes and Castes of the North-western Provinces and Oudh'' Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, Calcutta, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GJQn7XA6Cz4C&pg=PA158 p. 158], {{OCLC|4770515}}</ref>\n\nA ''khel'' is often based in a single village,<ref>[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan017434.pdf Wardak, A.

The plural form of ''pl\u0101r'' is ''pl\u0101rina''. A ''pl\u0101rina'' is considered only when the 7th generation is born, meaning the father of multiple families (''kahol''). Usually, the 7th forefather is assumed to take from one-and-a-half century to two centuries. '''''Kul''''' (plural ''kahol'') is the smallest unit in Pashtun tribal system, named after an ancestor of 1. ''Z\u0101mon'' (\"children\"), 2. ''Lmasay / Nwasay'' (\"grandchildren\"), 3. ''Ka\u1e5bwasay'' (\"great-grandchildren\"), and 4. ''Kaoday'' (\"great-great-grandchildren\"). Once the fourth generation is born, it would be labelled a \"family\" or ''k\u016bl''.\n\n==Dialects==\n{{Main|Pashto dialects}}\n\nThe '''Bettani''' speak various [[Pashto dialects]]. The [[Ghilji]] or (Gharzai) of the central region around [[Paktika Province|Paktika]] speak [[Central Pashto]], a dialect with unique phonetic features, transitional between the southern and the northern dialects of Pashto.<ref name=\"UND\" /> The [[Lohani]] (Rohani, Nohani) [[Marwat]], as well as some other minor Lodi tribes and the Bettani proper, speak the Marwat [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lodi]] Bettani dialect, which is a southern Pashto variety, however, its phonetics are different from the southern [[Kandahari Pashto]]. The Sheerani tribe of the Bettani confederacy speaks another southern dialect. The northern Bettani clans speak the northern or \"hard\" Pashto variety. Some of the Bettani lineages, including some (but not all) clans of the [[Niazi]], and [[Swati (Pashtun tribe)|Swati]] tribes, have abandoned Pashto. Today they speak other languages, like [[Urdu]], [[Hindko]], [[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Dari language|Dari]].\n\nThe '''Gharghashti''' [[Kakar]] [[Naghar]] [[Panni (Pashtun tribe)|Panni]] [[Mandokhel]] and [[Musakhel (Pashtun tribe)|Musakhel]] and other minor settled in the region around [[Quetta]] [[Zhob]] ans Loralai speak dialect, which is a \"soft\" Pashto dialect very similar to [[Kandahari Pashto]]. The Safi, some of the Jaduns, and some other minor northern Gharghashti tribes speak the northern or \"hard\" Pashto variety. The [[Jaduns]], living on the Mahabun mountain slopes around Swabi speak Pashto, while those living in Hazara speak Pashto and Hindko.<ref name=\"UND\"/>{{rp|26}} Some clans of the [[Safi (Pashtun tribe)|Safi]] tribe speak the [[Pashayi languages]] but are mostly bilingual in Pashto.\n\nThe '''Karlani''' speak some of the most distinctive Pashto dialects which are lexically different from standard Pashto varieties, and phonetically very varied. Furthermore, the Karlani dialects have a tendency towards a change in the pronunciation of vowels. Depending on the particular dialect, the standard Pashto [a], [\u0101], [o], [u] may change into [\u0101], [\u00e2/\u00e5/o], [\u022f/\u022b/e], [i], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranica.com/articles/afghanistan-vi-pasto |title=AFGHANISTAN vi.

Much of the [[Ormur]] tribe settled in some villages of Waziristan and Logar, who give their name to [[Ormur]] the folkloric ancestor of the [[Karlani]], speak the [[Ormuri language]] which is distinct from Pashto.<ref name=\"UND\"/>{{rp|33}} However, in general the Ormur are bilingual in Pashto, particularly in the Karlani dialect of [[Wazirwola dialect|Wazirwola]].\n\nThe '''Sarbani''' tribes, Southwestern most notably the [[Durrani]], speak (Kandahari Pashto) a \"soft\" dialect of Pashto; while Northwestern Sarbani tribes such as [[Gigyani tribe]], [[Yousafzai]] etc , most notably they speak (Peshawari Pashto) Pashto a \"hard\" dialect of Pashto. Both of them are considered upper class dialects. In addition, a small section of the [[Tareen|Tarin]] clan of the Sarbani living east of [[Quetta]] speak the distinctive [[Wanetsi]] (Tareeno) dialect, which is considered by some modern scholars to be distinctive enough to be classified as its own language.<ref>Hallberg, Daniel G. 1992.

The plural form of ''pl\u0101r'' is ''pl\u0101rina''. A ''pl\u0101rina'' is considered only when the 7th generation is born, meaning the father of multiple families (''kahol''). Usually, the 7th forefather is assumed to take from one-and-a-half century to two centuries.

The Sheerani tribe of the Bettani confederacy speaks another southern dialect. The northern Bettani clans speak the northern or \"hard\" Pashto variety. Some of the Bettani lineages, including some (but not all) clans of the [[Niazi]], and [[Swati (Pashtun tribe)|Swati]] tribes, have abandoned Pashto.

The Safi, some of the Jaduns, and some other minor northern Gharghashti tribes speak the northern or \"hard\" Pashto variety.

Furthermore, the Karlani dialects have a tendency towards a change in the pronunciation of vowels. Depending on the particular dialect, the standard Pashto [a], [\u0101], [o], [u] may change into [\u0101], [\u00e2/\u00e5/o], [\u022f/\u022b/e], [i], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranica.com/articles/afghanistan-vi-pasto |title=AFGHANISTAN vi.

Both of them are considered upper class dialects.
