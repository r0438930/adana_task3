{"title_page": "List of heads of state of Yugoslavia", "text_new": "This article lists the '''heads of state of Yugoslavia''' from the [[Creation of Yugoslavia|creation]] of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) in 1918 until the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|breakup]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1992.\n\nThe Kingdom of Yugoslavia was a monarchy ruled by the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty|House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] from 1918 up until [[World War II]]. The SFR Yugoslavia was headed first by [[Ivan Ribar]], the [[List of Presidents of the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia|President of the Presidium of the People's Assembly]] (president of the parliament), and then by President [[Josip Broz Tito]] from 1953 up until [[Death and state funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]] in 1980. Afterwards, the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia]] assumed the role of the [[collective leadership|collective]] head of state, rotating the presidency among representatives of republics and autonomous provinces. However, until 1990 the position of [[President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was usually the most powerful position (the position often coincided with the position of President). With the introduction of multi-party system in 1990, individual republics elected their own heads of state, but the country's head of state continued to rotate among appointed representatives of republics and autonomous provinces until the country's dissolution.\n\n==Kingdom of Yugoslavia==\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n{{Infobox monarchy\n| royal_title        = King\n| realm              = Yugoslavia\n| native_name        = <!-- Optional. -->\n| border             = <!-- Optional.

On that day, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] abolished the [[Vidovdan Constitution]] (adopted in 1921), prorogued the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia|National Assembly]] and introduced a personal dictatorship (so-called [[6 January Dictatorship]]). He officially renamed the country Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 3 October 1929 and, although granted the [[1931 Yugoslav Constitution|1931 Constitution]], continued to rule as a ''de facto'' [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] until his assassination on 9 October 1934, during a state visit to [[French Third Republic|France]]. After his assassination, parliamentary monarchy was put back in place.\n\nThe Kingdom of Yugoslavia was defeated and occupied on 17 April 1941 after the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|German invasion]]. The monarchy was formally abolished on 29 November 1945.\n\nAll monarchs were members of the [[House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]]. [[Peter I of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|Peter I]], previously [[List of Serbian monarchs|King of Serbia]] (since 1903), was proclaimed King by representatives of South Slav states. The royal family continued through his son ([[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]]) and his grandson ([[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]]).\n\n===List===\n{{legend|#F5F5DC|Denotes Acting Head of State}}\n{| style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=15% | Name !! width=105px | Portrait !! width=20% | Birth !! width=15% | Marriages !! width=15% | Death !! width=10% | Succession right !! width=10% | Note\n|-\n| '''[[Peter I of Serbia|Peter I]]'''<br />1 December 1918<br />{{ndash}}<br />16 August 1921<br />''({{age in years and days|1918|12|01|1921|08|16|duration=yes}})''|| [[File:Peter I Karadjordjevic of Serbia.jpg|100px|Peter I of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] || 29 June 1844<br>[[Belgrade]]{{hr}}son of [[Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Prince of Serbia]] and [[Persida Nenadovi\u0107]] || [[Princess Zorka of Montenegro]]<br>1883<br>5 children || 16 August 1921<br>[[Belgrade]]<br>aged 77|| previously [[King of Serbia]],<br>proclaimed King by representatives of South Slav states || Held the title \"King of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\".

On 29 November 1943 an AVNOJ conference proclaimed the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, while negotiations with the royal government in exile continued. After the [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation]] of [[Belgrade]] on 20 October 1944, the Communist-led government on 29 November 1945 declared [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] deposed and proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1953, the President of the Presidium of the National Assembly was the office of the Yugoslav head of state. The post was held by [[Ivan Ribar]].\n\nFrom 1953 to 1963, [[Josip Broz Tito]] simultaneously held the offices of the President of the Republic (head of state) and the President of the [[Federal Executive Council (Yugoslavia)|Federal Executive Council]] (head of government). The [[1963 Yugoslav Constitution|1963 Constitution]] renamed the state as Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and divided the office of the President of the Republic from the Presidency of the Federal Council, even if the President of the Republic retained the power to preside over the Government when it met, on the French model.<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yugoslavia_1963.doc Constitution of 1963]</ref>\n\nThe [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]] provided for a ''[[Presidency of Yugoslavia|collective federal presidency]]'', consisting of representatives of the six republics, the two autonomous provinces within Serbia and (until 1988) the President of the League of Communists, with a Chairman in rotation. Notwithstanding, this constitutional provision was suspended because Tito was declared ''[[President for Life]]'', thus chaired the collective presidency on a permanent basis. After [[Death and state funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]] in 1980, one member was annually elected ''President of the Presidency'' and acted as head of state.\n\n===List===\n{{legend2|{{League of Communists of Yugoslavia/meta/color}}|[[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia / League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Socialist Party of Serbia/meta/color}}|[[Socialist Party of Serbia]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Croatian Democratic Union/meta/color}}|[[Croatian Democratic Union]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro/meta/color}}|[[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#F5F5DC|Denotes Acting Head of State}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| {{abbr|No.|Number}}\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! width=20% rowspan=2| Name<br>{{small|(Born-Died)}}\n! rowspan=2| Representing\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! rowspan=2| Political party\n! rowspan=2| Note\n|-\n!

Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) in 1918 until the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|breakup]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1992.\n\nThe Kingdom of Yugoslavia was a monarchy ruled by the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty|House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] from 1918 up until [[World War II]]. The SFR Yugoslavia was headed first by [[Ivan Ribar]], the [[List of Presidents of the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia|President of the Presidium of the People's Assembly]] (president of the parliament), and then by President [[Josip Broz Tito]] from 1953 up until [[Death and state funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]] in 1980. Afterwards, the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia]] assumed the role of the [[collective leadership|collective]] head of state, rotating the presidency among representatives of republics and autonomous provinces. However, until 1990 the position of [[President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was usually the most powerful position (the position often coincided with the position of President). With the introduction of multi-party system in 1990, individual republics elected their own heads of state, but the country's head of state continued to rotate among appointed representatives of republics and autonomous provinces until the country's dissolution.\n\n==Kingdom of Yugoslavia==\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n{{Infobox monarchy\n| royal_title        = King\n| realm              = Yugoslavia\n| native_name        = <!-- Optional. -->\n| border             = <!-- Optional.

On that day, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] abolished the [[Vidovdan Constitution]] (adopted in 1921), prorogued the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia|National Assembly]] and introduced a personal dictatorship (so-called [[6 January Dictatorship]]). He officially renamed the country Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 3 October 1929 and, although granted the [[1931 Yugoslav Constitution|1931 Constitution]], continued to rule as a ''de facto'' [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] until his assassination on 9 October 1934, during a state visit to [[French Third Republic|France]]. After his assassination, parliamentary monarchy was put back in place.\n\nThe Kingdom of Yugoslavia was defeated and occupied on 17 April 1941 after the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|German invasion]]. The monarchy was formally abolished on 29 November 1945.\n\nAll monarchs were members of the [[House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]]. [[Peter I of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|Peter I]], previously [[List of Serbian monarchs|King of Serbia]] (since 1903), was proclaimed King by representatives of South Slav states. The royal family continued through his son ([[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]]) and his grandson ([[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]]).\n\n===List===\n{{legend|#F5F5DC|Denotes Acting Head of State}}\n{| style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=15% | Name !! width=105px | Portrait !! width=20% | Birth !! width=15% | Marriages !! width=15% | Death !! width=10% | Succession right !! width=10% | Note\n|-\n| '''[[Peter I of Serbia|Peter I]]'''<br />1 December 1918<br />{{ndash}}<br />16 August 1921<br />''({{age in years and days|1918|12|01|1921|08|16|duration=yes}})''|| [[File:Peter I Karadjordjevic of Serbia.jpg|100px|Peter I of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] || 29 June 1844<br>[[Belgrade]]{{hr}}son of [[Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Prince of Serbia]] and [[Persida Nenadovi\u0107]] || [[Princess Zorka of Montenegro]]<br>1883<br>5 children || 16 August 1921<br>[[Belgrade]]<br>aged 77|| previously [[King of Serbia]],<br>proclaimed King by representatives of South Slav states || Held the title \"King of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\".

On 29 November 1943 an AVNOJ conference proclaimed the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, while negotiations with the royal government in exile continued. After the [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation]] of [[Belgrade]] on 20 October 1944, the Communist-led government on 29 November 1945 declared [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] deposed and proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1953, the President of the Presidium of the National Assembly was the office of the Yugoslav head of state. The post was held by [[Ivan Ribar]].\n\nFrom 1953 to 1963, [[Josip Broz Tito]] simultaneously held the offices of the President of the Republic (head of state) and the President of the [[Federal Executive Council (Yugoslavia)|Federal Executive Council]] (head of government). The [[1963 Yugoslav Constitution|1963 Constitution]] renamed the state as Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and divided the office of the President of the Republic from the Presidency of the Federal Council, even if the President of the Republic retained the power to preside over the Government when it met, on the French model.<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yugoslavia_1963.doc Constitution of 1963]</ref>\n\nThe [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]] provided for a ''[[Presidency of Yugoslavia|collective federal presidency]]'', consisting of representatives of the six republics, the two autonomous provinces within Serbia and (until 1988) the President of the League of Communists, with a Chairman in rotation. Notwithstanding, this constitutional provision was suspended because Tito was declared ''[[President for Life]]'', thus chaired the collective presidency on a permanent basis. After [[Death and state funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]] in 1980, one member was annually elected ''President of the Presidency'' and acted as head of state.\n\n===List===\n{{legend2|{{League of Communists of Yugoslavia/meta/color}}|[[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia / League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Socialist Party of Serbia/meta/color}}|[[Socialist Party of Serbia]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Croatian Democratic Union/meta/color}}|[[Croatian Democratic Union]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro/meta/color}}|[[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#F5F5DC|Denotes Acting Head of State}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| {{abbr|No.|Number}}\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! width=20% rowspan=2| Name<br>{{small|(Born-Died)}}\n! rowspan=2| Representing\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! rowspan=2| Political party\n! rowspan=2| Note\n|-\n!
