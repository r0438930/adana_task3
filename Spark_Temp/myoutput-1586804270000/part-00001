Originally a \"small but ancient fishing village\" surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton, and by the [[Victorian era]] it was a fully developed town with borough status.  Neighbouring parishes such as [[Aldrington]] and [[Hangleton]] were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1997, as part of [[1990s United Kingdom local government reform|local government reform]], the borough merged with [[Brighton]] to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove, and this unitary authority was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.\n\n==Name and etymology==\nOld spellings of Hove include Hou ([[Domesday Book]], 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675).<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp265-268|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7, the Rape of Lewes.

Three farms\u2014Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn\u2014dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] described it as \"uncommonly rich\".  Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1\u20132\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1\u20132.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Middleton10\u201311\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=10\u201311.}}</ref>  The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as ''Hove Drove'' and led on to the Downs.  A long west\u2013east route which crossed [[West Blatchington]], Hove and Preston parishes on its way to [[Lewes]] now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove.  The section called The Droveway, on which the [[British Engineerium|Goldstone Waterworks]] was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when [[Hove Park]] was built.  A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer's Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv4p34\u201336\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 4, pp. 34\u201336.}}</ref>\n\nA large [[Sarsen]] stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of [[Hove Park]].

Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north\u2013south some 250&nbsp;m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.\n[[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] is a well-preserved 16th-century [[flint]] manor building. It is believed to have been built c. 1540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice [[High Sheriff of Sussex]], whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.\n\n===18th century===\nIn 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.\n\nIn 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>\n\n=== Regency and Victorian developments ===\nThe census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.\n\nAlso at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.\n\nThe fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.\n\nIn the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.\n\nDating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.\n\nThe Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of \u00a31 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.\n\nBy 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.\n\n[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794\u20131845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.\n\nThe flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].\n\nTwo further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.\n\nWest of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].\n\nHove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O\u2019Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J.

Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design.

Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uk FloralClockHove.jpg|thumb|right|Floral Clock, [[Palmeira Square]]]]\n[[Image:Hovebeach.jpg|thumb|right|Hove [[Esplanade|promenade]] facing towards [[Brighton]]]]\n\n== Transport ==\n{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}\n\nHove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.\n\nHove has three railway stations. [[Hove railway station]] has direct access to the [[Brighton main line]] to London via a loop eliminating the need to go through [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.\n\nBranching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.\n\n== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==\n[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]\n\n== Education ==\nHove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School.

Originally a \"small but ancient fishing village\" surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton, and by the [[Victorian era]] it was a fully developed town with borough status.  Neighbouring parishes such as [[Aldrington]] and [[Hangleton]] were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1997, as part of [[1990s United Kingdom local government reform|local government reform]], the borough merged with [[Brighton]] to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove, and this unitary authority was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.\n\n==Name and etymology==\nOld spellings of Hove include Hou ([[Domesday Book]], 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675).<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp265-268|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7, the Rape of Lewes.

Three farms\u2014Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn\u2014dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] described it as \"uncommonly rich\".  Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1\u20132\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1\u20132.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Middleton10\u201311\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=10\u201311.}}</ref>  The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as ''Hove Drove'' and led on to the Downs.  A long west\u2013east route which crossed [[West Blatchington]], Hove and Preston parishes on its way to [[Lewes]] now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove.  The section called The Droveway, on which the [[British Engineerium|Goldstone Waterworks]] was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when [[Hove Park]] was built.  A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer's Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv4p34\u201336\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 4, pp. 34\u201336.}}</ref>\n\nA large [[Sarsen]] stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of [[Hove Park]].

Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north\u2013south some 250&nbsp;m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.\n[[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] is a well-preserved 16th-century [[flint]] manor building. It is believed to have been built c. 1540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice [[High Sheriff of Sussex]], whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.\n\n===18th century===\nIn 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.\n\nIn 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>\n\n=== Regency and Victorian developments ===\nThe census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.\n\nAlso at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.\n\nThe fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.\n\nIn the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.\n\nDating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.\n\nThe Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of \u00a31 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.\n\nBy 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.\n\n[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794\u20131845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.\n\nThe flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].\n\nTwo further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.\n\nWest of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].\n\nHove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O\u2019Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J.

The committee commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], the architect responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on London's Whitehall which became the focus of [[national memory|national remembrance]] services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1187556 |desc=Hove War Memorial|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Tim|last2=Gliddon|first2=Gerald|title=Lutyens and the Great War|year=2008|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=9780711228788|pages=75, 169}}</ref>\n\n==Governance and politics==\n\n===Coat of arms===\nWhile it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own [[coat of arms]].

The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove's history.  The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest.  The [[saltire]] of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the leg-shackles of [[Leonard of Noblac]] refer to the ancient [[parish church]]es of Hove and [[Aldrington]], [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's]] and [[St Leonard's Church, Aldrington|St Leonard's]] respectively.

Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uk FloralClockHove.jpg|thumb|right|Floral Clock, [[Palmeira Square]]]]\n[[Image:Hovebeach.jpg|thumb|right|Hove [[Esplanade|promenade]] facing towards [[Brighton]]]]\n\n== Transport ==\n{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}\n\nHove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.\n\nHove has three railway stations. [[Hove railway station]] has direct access to the [[Brighton main line]] to London via a loop eliminating the need to go through [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.\n\nBranching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.\n\n== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==\n[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]\n\n== Education ==\nHove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School.
