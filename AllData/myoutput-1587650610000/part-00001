He also contested the Jewish [[blood libel]] during the 1899 [[Hilsner Affair|Hilsner trial]].\n\n==Early career==\nMasaryk served in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Reichsrat]] from 1891 to 1893 with the [[Young Czech Party]] and from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Czech Realist Party]], which he had founded in 1900. At that time, he was not yet campaigning for Czech and Slovak independence from Austria-Hungary. Masaryk helped [[Hinko Hinkovi\u0107]] defend the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] during their 1909 Vienna [[political trial]]; its members were sentenced to a total of over 150 years in prison, with a number of death sentences.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek independence for Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. He went into exile in December 1914 with his daughter, Olga, staying in several places in Western Europe, the Russian Empire, the United States and Japan. Masaryk began organizing Czechs and Slovaks outside Austria-Hungary during his exile, establishing contacts which would be crucial to Czechoslovak independence. He delivered lectures and wrote a number of articles and memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. Masaryk was pivotal in establishing the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] in Russia as an effective fighting force on the Allied side during World War I, when he held a Serbian passport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5.409.html:494171-Srbija-nekada-mamila-kao-Amerika|title=\u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430|website=www.novosti.rs}}</ref> In 1915 he was one of the first staff members of the [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (now part of [[University College London]]), where the student society and senior common room are named after him.

He published \"Racial Problems in Hungary\", with ideas about Czechoslovak independence. In 1916, Masaryk went to France to convince the French government of the necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. He consulted with his friend professor [[Pavel Miliukov]] an origin{{clarify|reason=what is origin?|date=January 2020}} and a state of Czechoslovak legions in Russia in London in that time. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] he proceeded to Russia to help organize the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], a group dedicated to Slavic resistance to the Austrians.\n\nOn 5 August 1914, the Russian High Command authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914, and was attached to the Russian Third Army.\n\nFrom its start, Masaryk wanted to develop the legion from a battalion to a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he realized that he would need to recruit Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the legion to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian army; the order was rescinded in a few weeks, however, because of opposition from other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuing efforts to persuade the Russian authorities to change their minds, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917.\n\nUnder these conditions, the Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew slowly from 1914 to 1917. In early 1916, it was reorganized as the First Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. After the Czechoslovak troops' performance in July 1917 at the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]] (when they overran Austrian trenches), the Russian provisional government granted Masaryk and the Czechoslovak National Council permission to recruit and mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (\u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd sbor na Rusi, also known as the Czechoslovak Legion \u2013 \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 legie). A second division of four regiments was added to the legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 by 1918.\n\nMasaryk formed a good connection with supreme commanders Russian army, [[Mikhail Alekseyev]], [[Aleksei Brusilov]], [[Nikolay Dukhonin]] and [[Mikhail Diterikhs]], in [[Mogilev]], from May 1917.\n\nMasaryk traveled to the United States in 1918, where he convinced President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the righteousness of his cause. On 5&nbsp;May 1918, over 150,000 [[Chicago]]ans filled the streets to welcome him; Chicago was the center of Czechoslovak immigration to the United States, and the city's reception echoed his earlier visits to the city and his visiting professorship at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1902 (Masaryk had lectured at the university in 1902 and 1907). He also had strong links to the United States, with his marriage to an American citizen and his friendship with Chicago industrialist [[Charles R. Crane]], who had Masaryk invited to the University of Chicago and introduced to the highest political circles (including Wilson). Except of the president Wilson and the secretary of the state [[Robert Lansing]] this was [[Ray Stannard Baker]] , W. Phillips, Polk, Long, Lane, D. F. Houston, [[Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet|William Wiseman]], [[Harry Pratt Judson]] and the French ambassador [[Jean Jules Jusserand]]. And [[Bernard Baruch]], Vance McCormick, [[Edward N. Hurley]], Samuel M. Vauclain, [[Colonel House]] too. On Chicago meeting in 8 October 1918 Chicago industrialist [[Samuel Insull]] introduced him as the president of future Czechoslovak Republik de facto and mentioned his legions.<ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

On 14 November of that year, he was [[1918 Czechoslovak presidential election|elected]] president of Czechoslovakia by the National Assembly in Prague while he was in New York. On 22 December, Masaryk publicly denounced the Germans in Czechoslovakia as settlers and colonists.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=140}}\n\nMasaryk was re-elected three times: in May [[1920 Czechoslovak presidential election|1920]], [[1927 Czechoslovak presidential election|1927]], and [[1934 Czechoslovak presidential election]]. A provision in the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|1920 constitution]] exempted him from its two-term limit.\n\nOn paper, Masaryk's presidential power was limited; the framers of the constitution intended to create a parliamentary system in which the [[Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia|prime minister]] and cabinet hold actual power. However, a complex system of [[proportional representation]] made it all but impossible for one party to win a majority; no party ever won more than 25 percent of the vote. Usually, ten or more parties received the 2.6 percent of votes needed for seats in the National Assembly. These factors resulted in frequent changes of government; there were ten cabinets, headed by nine statesmen, during Masaryk's tenure. His presence gave Czechoslovakia a large measure of stability. This stability, combined with his domestic and international prestige, gave Masaryk's presidency more power and influence than the framers of the constitution intended.\n\nHe used his authority in Czechoslovakia to create the [[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]] (the Castle), an extensive, informal political network. Under Masaryk's watch, Czechoslovakia became the strongest democracy in Central Europe.\n\nMasaryk visited France, Belgium, England, Egypt and the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] in 1923 and 1927. With [[Herbert Hoover]], he sponsored the first Prague International Management Congress, a July 1924 gathering of 120 global labour experts (of which 60 were from the [[United States]]), organized with Masaryk Academy of Labour.<ref>Proceedings from 1.PIMCO \"Encyclopedy of Performance\", 2500 pages (3 volumes \"Man\", \"Production\", \"Business\") Masaryk Academy of Labour, Prague 1924 - 1926</ref> After the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], Masaryk was one of the first political figures in Europe to voice concern.

He also contested the Jewish [[blood libel]] during the 1899 [[Hilsner Affair|Hilsner trial]].\n\n==Early career==\nMasaryk served in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Reichsrat]] from 1891 to 1893 with the [[Young Czech Party]] and from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Czech Realist Party]], which he had founded in 1900. At that time, he was not yet campaigning for Czech and Slovak independence from Austria-Hungary. Masaryk helped [[Hinko Hinkovi\u0107]] defend the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] during their 1909 Vienna [[political trial]]; its members were sentenced to a total of over 150 years in prison, with a number of death sentences.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek independence for Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. He went into exile in December 1914 with his daughter, Olga, staying in several places in Western Europe, the Russian Empire, the United States and Japan. Masaryk began organizing Czechs and Slovaks outside Austria-Hungary during his exile, establishing contacts which would be crucial to Czechoslovak independence. He delivered lectures and wrote a number of articles and memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. Masaryk was pivotal in establishing the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] in Russia as an effective fighting force on the Allied side during World War I, when he held a Serbian passport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5.409.html:494171-Srbija-nekada-mamila-kao-Amerika|title=\u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430|website=www.novosti.rs}}</ref> In 1915 he was one of the first staff members of the [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (now part of [[University College London]]), where the student society and senior common room are named after him.

He published \"Racial Problems in Hungary\", with ideas about Czechoslovak independence. In 1916, Masaryk went to France to convince the French government of the necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. He consulted with his friend professor [[Pavel Miliukov]] an origin{{clarify|reason=what is origin?|date=January 2020}} and a state of Czechoslovak legions in Russia in London in that time. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] he proceeded to Russia to help organize the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], a group dedicated to Slavic resistance to the Austrians.\n\nOn 5 August 1914, the Russian High Command authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914, and was attached to the Russian Third Army.\n\nFrom its start, Masaryk wanted to develop the legion from a battalion to a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he realized that he would need to recruit Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the legion to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian army; the order was rescinded in a few weeks, however, because of opposition from other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuing efforts to persuade the Russian authorities to change their minds, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917.\n\nUnder these conditions, the Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew slowly from 1914 to 1917. In early 1916, it was reorganized as the First Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. After the Czechoslovak troops' performance in July 1917 at the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]] (when they overran Austrian trenches), the Russian provisional government granted Masaryk and the Czechoslovak National Council permission to recruit and mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (\u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd sbor na Rusi, also known as the Czechoslovak Legion \u2013 \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 legie). A second division of four regiments was added to the legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 by 1918.\n\nMasaryk formed a good connection with supreme commanders Russian army, [[Mikhail Alekseyev]], [[Aleksei Brusilov]], [[Nikolay Dukhonin]] and [[Mikhail Diterikhs]], in [[Mogilev]], from May 1917.\n\nMasaryk traveled to the United States in 1918, where he convinced President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the righteousness of his cause. On 5&nbsp;May 1918, over 150,000 [[Chicago]]ans filled the streets to welcome him; Chicago was the center of Czechoslovak immigration to the United States, and the city's reception echoed his earlier visits to the city and his visiting professorship at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1902 (Masaryk had lectured at the university in 1902 and 1907). He also had strong links to the United States, with his marriage to an American citizen and his friendship with Chicago industrialist [[Charles R. Crane]], who had Masaryk invited to the University of Chicago and introduced to the highest political circles (including Wilson). Except of the president Wilson and the secretary of the state [[Robert Lansing]] this was [[Ray Stannard Baker]] , W. Phillips, Polk, Long, Lane, D. F. Houston, [[Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet|William Wiseman]], [[Harry Pratt Judson]] and the French ambassador [[Jean Jules Jusserand]]. And [[Bernard Baruch]], Vance McCormick, [[Edward N. Hurley]], Samuel M. Vauclain, [[Colonel House]] too. On Chicago meeting in 8 October 1918 Chicago industrialist [[Samuel Insull]] introduced him as the president of future Czechoslovak Republik de facto and mentioned his legions.<ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

A provision in the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|1920 constitution]] exempted him from its two-term limit.\n\nOn paper, Masaryk's presidential power was limited; the framers of the constitution intended to create a parliamentary system in which the [[Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia|prime minister]] and cabinet hold actual power. However, a complex system of [[proportional representation]] made it all but impossible for one party to win a majority; no party ever won more than 25 percent of the vote. Usually, ten or more parties received the 2.6 percent of votes needed for seats in the National Assembly. These factors resulted in frequent changes of government; there were ten cabinets, headed by nine statesmen, during Masaryk's tenure. His presence gave Czechoslovakia a large measure of stability. This stability, combined with his domestic and international prestige, gave Masaryk's presidency more power and influence than the framers of the constitution intended.\n\nHe used his authority in Czechoslovakia to create the [[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]] (the Castle), an extensive, informal political network. Under Masaryk's watch, Czechoslovakia became the strongest democracy in Central Europe.\n\nMasaryk visited France, Belgium, England, Egypt and the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] in 1923 and 1927. With [[Herbert Hoover]], he sponsored the first Prague International Management Congress, a July 1924 gathering of 120 global labour experts (of which 60 were from the [[United States]]), organized with Masaryk Academy of Labour.<ref>Proceedings from 1.PIMCO \"Encyclopedy of Performance\", 2500 pages (3 volumes \"Man\", \"Production\", \"Business\") Masaryk Academy of Labour, Prague 1924 - 1926</ref> After the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], Masaryk was one of the first political figures in Europe to voice concern. He resigned from office on 14 December 1935 because of old age and poor health, and was succeeded by [[Edvard Bene\u0161]].\n\n=={{anchor|Recognition}}Death and legacy==\n[[File:Statue of Masaryk in Prague, Apr 2012.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Urban statue of Masaryk|[[Statue of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, Prague|Statue]] of Masaryk in Prague]]\nMasaryk died less than two years after leaving office, at the age of 87, in [[L\u00e1ny (Kladno District)|L\u00e1ny]], Czechoslovakia (present-day [[Czech Republic]]). He did not live to see the [[Munich Agreement]] or the Nazi occupation of his country, and was known as the Grand (Great) Old Man of Europe.\n\n===Commemoration and awards===\nAs the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of Czechoslovakia, Masaryk is revered as [[George Washington]] is in the [[United States]]. Czechs and Slovaks regard him as a symbol of democracy.\n\nCommemorations of Masaryk have been held annually in the L\u00e1ny cemetery on his birthday and day of death (7 March and 14 September) since 1989.\n\nThe Czechoslovak, then Czech [[Order of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]], established in 1990, is an [[order (distinction)|honour]] awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to humanity, democracy and human rights.\n\n[[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno]], founded in 1919 as Czechoslovakia's second university, was named after him when it was founded; after 30 years as Univerzita [[Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b|Jana Evangelisty Purkyn\u011b]] v Brn\u011b, it was renamed for Masaryk in 1990.\n\nHe is commemorated by a number of statues, busts and plaques. Although most are in the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]], Masaryk has a [[Statue of Tomas Masaryk (Washington, D.C.)|statue]] on [[Embassy Row]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and in the [[Midway Plaisance]] park in [[Chicago]] and {{citation needed span|date=June 2019|text=is memorialised in [[San Francisco]]'s Golden Gate Park [[rose garden]].}} A plaque with a portrait of Masaryk is on the wall of a Rachiv, [[Ukraine]] hotel where he reportedly resided from 1917 to 1918, and a bust was erected in 2002 on Druzhba Narodiv Square (Friendship of Nations Square) in [[Uzhhorod]], Ukraine. Yugoslavia awarded him [[Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star]].<ref>{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Acovi\u0107|first=Dragomir|title=Slava i \u010dast: Odlikovanja me\u0111u Srbima, Srbi me\u0111u odlikovanjima|year=2012|location=Belgrade|publisher=Slu\u017ebeni Glasnik|pages=369}}</ref>\n\n[[Avenida Presidente Masaryk]] (President Masaryk Avenue) is a main thoroughfare in [[Mexico City]], and [[Masaryktown, Florida]] is named for him.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H6xaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xk8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5126%2C1819266 | title=Into center of state | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=Mar 23, 1952 | accessdate=1 November 2015 | author=Blackstone, Lillian | page=19}}</ref> \n\nIn Israel, Masaryk is considered an important figure and a national friend. A village was named after him - [[Kfar Masaryk|Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk]] near Haifa, which was largely founded by Jewish immigrants from Czechoslovakia. One of the main squares in [[Tel Aviv]] is [[Masaryk Square]] (he had visited the city in 1927). In [[Haifa]], one of the junctions in the city was named after him as well. \nMany cities in Israel named streets after his name, including [[Jerusalem]], [[Petach Tikva]], [[Netanya]], [[Nahariya]] and others. A Masaryk forest was planted in the Western Galilee.<ref>https://www.kkl-jnf.org/about-kkl-jnf/green-israel-news/february-2019/kkl-czech-republic-michael-pakowski-birthday/</ref>.\n\nStreets in [[Zagreb]], [[Belgrade]], [[Dubrovnik]], [[Daruvar]], [[Vara\u017edin]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]] are named Masarykova ulica, and a main thoroughfare in [[Ljubljana]] is named after Masaryk.

A photograph of Masaryk leaning out of a train window, waving to and shaking hands with supporters, is the front cover for [[Faith No More]]'s 1997 album ''[[Album of the Year (Faith No More album)|Album of the Year]]''. Its [[liner notes]] include the funeral of an old man, with the words ''\"[[Truth prevails|pravda v\u00edt\u011bz\u00ed]]\"'' (\"Truth prevails\") adorning the coffin. The statement is the [[national motto|motto]] of the Czech Republic.\n\n==Philosophy==\nMasaryk's motto was \"Do not fear, and do not steal\" ({{lang-cz|Neb\u00e1t se a nekr\u00e1st}}). A philosopher and an outspoken [[rationalist]] and [[Humanism|humanist]], he emphasised practical [[ethics]] reflecting the influence of Anglo-Saxon philosophers, French philosophy and\u2014in particular\u2014the work of 18th-century German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who is considered the founder of nationalism. Masaryk was critical of [[German idealism]] and [[Marxism]].<ref>Masaryk, T.

[[Karel \u010capek]] wrote a series of articles, ''Hovory s T.G.M.'' (\"Conversations with T.G.M.\"), which were later collected as Masaryk's [[autobiography]].\n\n==Personal life==\nMasaryk married [[Charlotte Garrigue]] in 1878, and took her family name as his middle name. They met in [[Leipzig]], Germany, and became engaged in 1877. Garrigue was born in [[Brooklyn]] to a Protestant family with French [[Huguenots]] among their ancestors. She became fluent in Czech, and published articles in a Czech magazine.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Hardships during the war took their toll, and she died in 1923. Their son, [[Jan Masaryk|Jan]], was Czechoslovak ambassador in London, [[foreign minister]] in the Czechoslovak government-in-exile (1940\u20131945) and in the governments from 1945 to 1948.
