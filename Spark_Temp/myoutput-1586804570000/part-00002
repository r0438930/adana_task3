[[Delirium]] can occur, where the patient is often calm, but sometimes becomes agitated. This delirium has led to typhoid receiving the nickname \"nervous fever\". [[Rose spots]] appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around a third of patients. [[Rhonchi]] (rattling breathing sounds) are heard in the base of the lungs. The abdomen is distended and painful in the right lower quadrant, where a rumbling sound can be heard. Diarrhea can occur in this stage, but constipation is also common. The spleen and liver are enlarged ([[hepatosplenomegaly]]) and tender, and liver [[transaminases]] are elevated. The Widal test is strongly positive, with antiO and antiH antibodies. Blood cultures are sometimes still positive at this stage.

This test is carried out on a cellulose nitrate membrane where a specific ''S. typhi'' outer membrane protein is attached as fixed test lines. It separately identifies IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM shows recent infection whereas IgG signifies remote infection.\n\nThe sample pad of this kit contains colloidal gold-anti-human IgG or gold-anti-human IgM. If the sample contains IgG and IgM antibodies against those antigens then they will react and get turned into red color. This complex will continue to move forward and the IgG and IgM antibodies will get attached to the first test line where IgG and IgM antigens are present giving a pink-purplish colored band. This complex will continue to move further and reach the control line which consists of rabbit anti-mouse antibody which bends the mouse anti-human IgG or IgM antibodies. The main purpose of the control line is to indicate a proper migration and reagent color. The typhidot test becomes positive within 2\u20133 days of infection.\n\nTwo colored bands indicate a positive test. Single-band of control line indicates a negative test. Single-band of first fixed line or no bands at all indicates invalid tests. The most important limitation of this test is that it is not quantitative and the result is only positive or negative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Pak-Leong|last2=Tam|first2=Frankie C.

[[Delirium]] can occur, where the patient is often calm, but sometimes becomes agitated. This delirium has led to typhoid receiving the nickname \"nervous fever\". [[Rose spots]] appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around a third of patients. [[Rhonchi]] (rattling breathing sounds) are heard in the base of the lungs. The abdomen is distended and painful in the right lower quadrant, where a rumbling sound can be heard. Diarrhea can occur in this stage, but constipation is also common. The spleen and liver are enlarged ([[hepatosplenomegaly]]) and tender, and liver [[transaminases]] are elevated. The Widal test is strongly positive, with antiO and antiH antibodies. Blood cultures are sometimes still positive at this stage. The major symptom of this fever is that it usually rises in the afternoon up to the first and second week.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n* In the third week of typhoid fever, a number of complications can occur:\n** [[Gastrointestinal bleeding|Intestinal haemorrhage]] due to bleeding in congested [[Peyer's patches]] occurs; this can be very serious, but is usually not fatal.\n** Intestinal perforation in the distal [[ileum]] is a very serious complication and is frequently fatal.

This test is carried out on a cellulose nitrate membrane where a specific ''S. typhi'' outer membrane protein is attached as fixed test lines. It separately identifies IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM shows recent infection whereas IgG signifies remote infection.\n\nThe sample pad of this kit contains colloidal gold-anti-human IgG or gold-anti-human IgM. If the sample contains IgG and IgM antibodies against those antigens then they will react and get turned into red color. This complex will continue to move forward and the IgG and IgM antibodies will get attached to the first test line where IgG and IgM antigens are present giving a pink-purplish colored band. This complex will continue to move further and reach the control line which consists of rabbit anti-mouse antibody which bends the mouse anti-human IgG or IgM antibodies. The main purpose of the control line is to indicate a proper migration and reagent color. The typhidot test becomes positive within 2\u20133 days of infection.\n\nTwo colored bands indicate a positive test. Single-band of control line indicates a negative test. Single-band of first fixed line or no bands at all indicates invalid tests. The most important limitation of this test is that it is not quantitative and the result is only positive or negative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Pak-Leong|last2=Tam|first2=Frankie C.
