Broken pieces of clay already refer to early trade relations. However the story of the community begins firstly in the early Middle Ages.\n\n600\u2013700 The first settlements begin in the area Oberberg.\n\nBetween 768 and 918 Probably N\u00fcmbrecht already exists as a settlement. (N\u00fcmbrecht means: measured district for a new settlement)\n\n955 Probably the year of construction of the Evangelic Church N\u00fcmbrecht.\n\n1131 First authentic mentions of the settlement N\u00fcmbrecht.\n\nBetween 900 and 1200 The settlement Marienberghausen arises.\n\n1 December 1264 With the acceptance of the county of Sayn by [[Gottfried I]] begins the story of the domination by Homburg.\n\n1268\u201376 Gottfried I builds the \"Castle Homburg\" as his residence.\n\n1359 At that time the count of Sayn marries the daughter of the last count of Wittgenstein and expands its name to \"of Sayn count to Wittgenstein\".\n\n1665 The chapel of Marienberghausen is completed to a church, that has retained its form until today.\n\n1743 The Homburgische characteristic dynasty is gone out, the domination falls to the house Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg.\n\n1792 Christian Heinrich, count of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg is raised in the sovereign state.\n\n1806 Son Friedrich Albert loses the official power as a sovereign, because of the foundation of the Rhine alliance. After 530 years the Homburgian government is over.\n\n1808 Both Marien N\u00fcmbrecht and Marienberghausen are established and are incorporated into the Napoleonic grand duchy Berg.\n\n1813 The domination of the Frenchmen is concluded, and the Marien, renamed in mayor offices, stand under Prussian supremacy.\n\n1845 The Rhine local code is released. On this base the first municipal council at N\u00fcmbrecht and also at Marienberghausen can be chosen.\n\n1933 Government falls into the hands of members of the NSDAP, and anxiety and arbitrariness dominate N\u00fcmbrecht for 12 years.\n\n1946 Democratic order is restored and a new municipal council is chosen.\n\n1968 The administration of both municipalities N\u00fcmbrecht and Marienberghausen are joined.\n\n1969 With the taking effect of the \"law about the reorganisation of the Oberbergischen Kreis\" the today's large community arises from Marienberghausen and N\u00fcmbrecht.\n\n1973 N\u00fcmbrecht receives from the minister of work, health and social duties the national recognition as an air spa.\n\n1987 the national recognition as a well-being climatic spa. The numerous cure and leisure time arrangements are developed further and supplemented.\n\n1992 The high school in N\u00fcmbrecht is founded.\n\n1994 Founding of the Sophie Scholl school.\n\n1995 Opening the Rhein-Sieg clinic - departments of Orthopedics and neurology - in H\u00f6henstrasse in N\u00fcmbrecht.\n\n2003 as the first local authority district in North Rhine-Westphalia N\u00fcmbrecht with the environmental roof brand Viabono (brand name for environment-friendly tourism) was distinguished. In addition, N\u00fcmbrecht was classed as a remedial-climatic health resort of the Premium Class.\n\n==The coat of arms of N\u00fcmbrecht==\nThe arms were granted on 4 January 1936 and again in 1969.\n\nThe arms are identical to the arms of the Homburg Estate, a possession of the Counts of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. The castle is also used in the arms of the district. The Homburg is situated in the municipality. Above the left tower is the arms of the Counts themselves.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Art Society of N\u00fcmbrecht===\n[[Image:Haus-d.-kunst.JPG|thumb|left|150px|House of art]]\nSince 1983 the N\u00fcmbrechter art association exists.\nVarious exhibitions take place in the house of the art in N\u00fcmbrecht.

She stands in the health resort park of N\u00fcmbrecht below the column well.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sights==\n\n===Watchtower===\nThe 30-metre high watchtower at the \"Lindchen\" in N\u00fcmbrecht has 154 steps; the top of the tower is 371 m above sea level. From the top, one can see the [[Rhine]], the [[Siebengebirge]] mountain range and even as far as the [[Rothaargebirge]] mountain range.\n\n===Amiger tunnel===\nThis iron ore mining tunnel known as the Amiger tunnel is approximately 200 to 300 years old. The Amiger tunnel is situated in a forest area called \"In the Goldkaule\", below the \"Alfred Lang\" hut and the watchtower. The tunnel is approximately 20 meters long. However, according to local legends, the tunnel goes as far as the village [[\u00d6dinghausen]]. Today the entry to the tunnel is shut off by a grating and only the bats know where the tunnel leads...\n\n===Benroth===\nThe \"[[ecovillage]]\" Benroth is about five kilometers from N\u00fcmbrecht. The conversion of Benroth into an \"ecological village of the future\" required a few smaller and larger measures, such as the installation of a moist [[biotope]] and [[Dry-stone wall|drystone-wallings]]. The one-hour tour \"ecomile\" through the village allows an insight into the projects.\n\n===Half timbering===\n[[Image:Bruch-9k.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The eldest house in Bruch (1728)]]\n\nThere are a number of well-preserved half-timbering houses in the small village Bruch northeast of N\u00fcmbrecht. Most of them date back to the 19th century. Some of them were built on the foundation walls of the previous houses.\n\n===Remarkable rocks===\nNear N\u00fcmbrecht, small [[quartzite]] [[monadnock]]s from the [[Devonian]] period (approximately 360 million years ago) were exposed by erosion of softer sedimentary rock. [[Crinoid]]s (\"sea lily\") and [[brachiopod]] fossils have been discovered here (so they are neither erratic blocks from the [[ice age]] nor [[meteorite]]s, as was formerly believed).\n\n===Witches' ponds===\n[[File:Hexenweiher herbst08 -4.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Witches' ponds]]\nTwo ponds below the nearby village of Spreitgen are known as ''Hexenweiher'' (\"[[witch]]es' ponds\"). It is not known whether the name derives from actual [[witchcraft trial]]s by dunking during the [[Middle Ages]]. (In these trials the witches were thrown into a pond with their hands cuffed and their feet tied together. If they went under and drowned, they were considered to be innocent. If they survived they were proven to be a witch and often burnt.) [[#Castle Homburg|Castle Homburg]] is a historic site of witchcraft trials. In a trial on 14 September 1631, for example, six women were accused of being witches. Because they confessed, they were given mercy and beheaded instead of being burnt alive.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Churches===\n[[Image:N\u00fcmb-ki.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Ev. church N\u00fcmbrecht]]\n\nThe 1000-year-old church next to the castle in N\u00fcmbrecht is one of the most interesting sacral buildings of the area: the tower was built in [[romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]], the romanesque part of the interior features massive medieval pillars and reinforcing arches. The ribbed structure of the apses is typical of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Flat vaults were added at the end of the 17th century. The top construction of the tower and the altar reflects [[Baroque architecture]].\n\nThe church \"Bunte Kerke\" in Marienberghausen features medieval wall paintings. The building was changed and reconstructed several times and thus lost its original appearance of a typical fortified church. The west tower is all that is left from the original 12th-century building. The late Gothic paintings in the interior are preserved however. The paintings had been painted over during the\nProtestant Reformation period and they surfaced when the organ was renovated in 1910. Only a couple of gothic wall paintings in the area are preserved to this day.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marienberghausen===\n[[Image:marienbrg-3.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Protestant church at Marienberghausen]]\nIn both 1969 and 1991 Marienberghausen won the German federal competition '''\"Unser Dorf soll sch\u00f6ner werden\"''' (\"Our village shall become more beautiful\"). It is also the birthplace of the opera ''[[H\u00e4nsel und Gretel (opera)|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel]]'', composed here by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] and also first performed here.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Mail coach===\n[[File:Postkutsche-k.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe \"[[Oberbergische Postkutsche]]\", a mail coach, runs between N\u00fcmbrecht and Wiehl every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from May to the end of October. It is a reproduction of the mail coach of the Imperial Post Office around 1871.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Homburg Castle===\n[[Image:homburg.jpg|left|thumb|110px|[[Homburg Castle]]]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Health resort park===\n\n====Column well in the health resort park====\n[[Image:Brunnen-kk.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Column well]]\nThe column well fountain in the health resort park was created by sculptor Michael Schwarze. It was built for the horticultural show (''Landesgartenschau'') held in N\u00fcrmbrecht in 1974. The figures of the well symbolize the age-old will of humans to free themselves from obligations of life.\nThe female figures are the symbols of beauty and fertility, the fists express force and assertiveness. The hand is an indication of understanding and work. The male leg stands for progress and conquest.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n====Berlin place====\n[[Image:b-b\u00e4r-3-k.jpg|left|thumb|90px|Berliner bear]]\n\nThe Berlin bear is a present of the [[Senate of Berlin]]. He was put up shortly before the land garden show in 1974 in the health resort park. Berlin citizens could spend a free vacation in N\u00fcmbrecht, this was promoted by the country of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Special supplies of the health resort====\n[[Image:ballon-2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Balloon glow in the light festival]]\n\n* Light festival in the health resort park, always on the 2nd week-end in July\n* Christmassy work art market, the last week-end before the 1st Advent\n* Health resort concerts in the health resort hall or Rhine Sieg clinic (Rhein-Sieg-Klinik, named after the two rivers), Sunday 15.00 o'clock\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Industry==\nIn the municipality 3 industrial zones are namely in Elsenroth - Gaderoth and in Breunfeld. The most different companies are resident there.\n\nThe biggest [[employer]] in [[municipality]] is the SARSTEDT Verwaltungs AG with her factories in village Rommelsdorf and Winterborn. The company develops, produces and sells machines and consumable material for [[medicine]] and [[science]]. The setting up followed in the year 1961 and occupies nowadays 2,250 employees worldwide.\n\nJust as is the KABE LABORTECHNIK GmbH in Elsenroth a bigger medicine technology company.

Broken pieces of clay already refer to early trade relations. However the story of the community begins firstly in the early Middle Ages.\n\n600\u2013700 The first settlements begin in the area Oberberg.\n\nBetween 768 and 918 Probably N\u00fcmbrecht already exists as a settlement. (N\u00fcmbrecht means: measured district for a new settlement)\n\n955 Probably the year of construction of the Evangelic Church N\u00fcmbrecht.\n\n1131 First authentic mentions of the settlement N\u00fcmbrecht.\n\nBetween 900 and 1200 The settlement Marienberghausen arises.\n\n1 December 1264 With the acceptance of the county of Sayn by [[Gottfried I]] begins the story of the domination by Homburg.\n\n1268\u201376 Gottfried I builds the \"Castle Homburg\" as his residence.\n\n1359 At that time the count of Sayn marries the daughter of the last count of Wittgenstein and expands its name to \"of Sayn count to Wittgenstein\".\n\n1665 The chapel of Marienberghausen is completed to a church, that has retained its form until today.\n\n1743 The Homburgische characteristic dynasty is gone out, the domination falls to the house Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg.\n\n1792 Christian Heinrich, count of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg is raised in the sovereign state.\n\n1806 Son Friedrich Albert loses the official power as a sovereign, because of the foundation of the Rhine alliance. After 530 years the Homburgian government is over.\n\n1808 Both Marien N\u00fcmbrecht and Marienberghausen are established and are incorporated into the Napoleonic grand duchy Berg.\n\n1813 The domination of the Frenchmen is concluded, and the Marien, renamed in mayor offices, stand under Prussian supremacy.\n\n1845 The Rhine local code is released. On this base the first municipal council at N\u00fcmbrecht and also at Marienberghausen can be chosen.\n\n1933 Government falls into the hands of members of the NSDAP, and anxiety and arbitrariness dominate N\u00fcmbrecht for 12 years.\n\n1946 Democratic order is restored and a new municipal council is chosen.\n\n1968 The administration of both municipalities N\u00fcmbrecht and Marienberghausen are joined.\n\n1969 With the taking effect of the \"law about the reorganisation of the Oberbergischen Kreis\" the today's large community arises from Marienberghausen and N\u00fcmbrecht.\n\n1973 N\u00fcmbrecht receives from the minister of work, health and social duties the national recognition as an air spa.\n\n1987 the national recognition as a well-being climatic spa. The numerous cure and leisure time arrangements are developed further and supplemented.\n\n1992 The high school in N\u00fcmbrecht is founded.\n\n1994 Founding of the Sophie Scholl school.\n\n1995 Opening the Rhein-Sieg clinic - departments of Orthopedics and neurology - in H\u00f6henstrasse in N\u00fcmbrecht.\n\n2003 as the first local authority district in North Rhine-Westphalia N\u00fcmbrecht with the environmental roof brand Viabono (brand name for environment-friendly tourism) was distinguished. In addition, N\u00fcmbrecht was classed as a remedial-climatic health resort of the Premium Class.\n\n==The coat of arms of N\u00fcmbrecht==\nThe arms were granted on 4 January 1936 and again in 1969.\n\nThe arms are identical to the arms of the Homburg Estate, a possession of the Counts of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. The castle is also used in the arms of the district. The Homburg is situated in the municipality. Above the left tower is the arms of the Counts themselves.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Art Society of N\u00fcmbrecht===\n[[Image:Haus-d.-kunst.JPG|thumb|left|150px|House of art]]\nSince 1983 the N\u00fcmbrechter art association exists.\nVarious exhibitions take place in the house of the art in N\u00fcmbrecht.

She stands in the health resort park of N\u00fcmbrecht below the column well.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sights==\n\n===Watchtower===\nThe 30-metre high watchtower at the \"Lindchen\" in N\u00fcmbrecht has 154 steps; the top of the tower is 371 m above sea level. From the top, one can see the [[Rhine]], the [[Siebengebirge]] mountain range and even as far as the [[Rothaargebirge]] mountain range.\n\n===Amiger tunnel===\nThis iron ore mining tunnel known as the Amiger tunnel is approximately 200 to 300 years old. The Amiger tunnel is situated in a forest area called \"In the Goldkaule\", below the \"Alfred Lang\" hut and the watchtower. The tunnel is approximately 20 meters long. However, according to local legends, the tunnel goes as far as the village [[\u00d6dinghausen]]. Today the entry to the tunnel is shut off by a grating and only the bats know where the tunnel leads...\n\n===Benroth===\nThe \"[[ecovillage]]\" Benroth is about five kilometers from N\u00fcmbrecht. The conversion of Benroth into an \"ecological village of the future\" required a few smaller and larger measures, such as the installation of a moist [[biotope]] and [[Dry-stone wall|drystone-wallings]]. The one-hour tour \"ecomile\" through the village allows an insight into the projects.\n\n===Half timbering===\n[[Image:Bruch-9k.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The eldest house in Bruch (1728)]]\n\nThere are a number of well-preserved half-timbering houses in the small village Bruch northeast of N\u00fcmbrecht. Most of them date back to the 19th century. Some of them were built on the foundation walls of the previous houses.\n\n===Remarkable rocks===\nNear N\u00fcmbrecht, small [[quartzite]] [[monadnock]]s from the [[Devonian]] period (approximately 360 million years ago) were exposed by erosion of softer sedimentary rock. [[Crinoid]]s (\"sea lily\") and [[brachiopod]] fossils have been discovered here (so they are neither erratic blocks from the [[ice age]] nor [[meteorite]]s, as was formerly believed).\n\n===Witches' ponds===\n[[File:Hexenweiher herbst08 -4.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Witches' ponds]]\nTwo ponds below the nearby village of Spreitgen are known as ''Hexenweiher'' (\"[[witch]]es' ponds\"). It is not known whether the name derives from actual [[witchcraft trial]]s by dunking during the [[Middle Ages]]. (In these trials the witches were thrown into a pond with their hands cuffed and their feet tied together. If they went under and drowned, they were considered to be innocent. If they survived they were proven to be a witch and often burnt.) [[#Castle Homburg|Castle Homburg]] is a historic site of witchcraft trials. In a trial on 14 September 1631, for example, six women were accused of being witches. Because they confessed, they were given mercy and beheaded instead of being burnt alive.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Churches===\n[[Image:N\u00fcmb-ki.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Ev. church N\u00fcmbrecht]]\n\nThe 1000-year-old church next to the castle in N\u00fcmbrecht is one of the most interesting sacral buildings of the area: the tower was built in [[romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]], the romanesque part of the interior features massive medieval pillars and reinforcing arches. The ribbed structure of the apses is typical of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Flat vaults were added at the end of the 17th century. The top construction of the tower and the altar reflects [[Baroque architecture]].\n\nThe church \"Bunte Kerke\" in Marienberghausen features medieval wall paintings. The building was changed and reconstructed several times and thus lost its original appearance of a typical fortified church. The west tower is all that is left from the original 12th-century building. The late Gothic paintings in the interior are preserved however. The paintings had been painted over during the\nProtestant Reformation period and they surfaced when the organ was renovated in 1910. Only a couple of gothic wall paintings in the area are preserved to this day.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marienberghausen===\n[[Image:marienbrg-3.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Protestant church at Marienberghausen]]\nIn both 1969 and 1991 Marienberghausen won the German federal competition '''\"Unser Dorf soll sch\u00f6ner werden\"''' (\"Our village shall become more beautiful\"). It is also the birthplace of the opera ''[[H\u00e4nsel und Gretel (opera)|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel]]'', composed here by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] and also first performed here.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Mail coach===\n[[File:Postkutsche-k.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe \"[[Oberbergische Postkutsche]]\", a mail coach, runs between N\u00fcmbrecht and Wiehl every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from May to the end of October. It is a reproduction of the mail coach of the Imperial Post Office around 1871.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Homburg Castle===\n[[Image:homburg.jpg|left|thumb|110px|[[Homburg Castle]]]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Health resort park===\n\n====Column well in the health resort park====\n[[Image:Brunnen-kk.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Column well]]\nThe column well fountain in the health resort park was created by sculptor Michael Schwarze. It was built for the horticultural show (''Landesgartenschau'') held in N\u00fcrmbrecht in 1974. The figures of the well symbolize the age-old will of humans to free themselves from obligations of life.\nThe female figures are the symbols of beauty and fertility, the fists express force and assertiveness. The hand is an indication of understanding and work. The male leg stands for progress and conquest.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n====Berlin place====\n[[Image:b-b\u00e4r-3-k.jpg|left|thumb|90px|Berliner bear]]\n\nThe Berlin bear is a present of the [[Senate of Berlin]]. He was put up shortly before the land garden show in 1974 in the health resort park. Berlin citizens could spend a free vacation in N\u00fcmbrecht, this was promoted by the country of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Special supplies of the health resort====\n[[Image:ballon-2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Balloon glow in the light festival]]\n\n* Light festival in the health resort park, always on the 2nd week-end in July\n* Christmassy work art market, the last week-end before the 1st Advent\n* Health resort concerts in the health resort hall or Rhine Sieg clinic (Rhein-Sieg-Klinik, named after the two rivers), Sunday 15.00 o'clock\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Industry==\nIn the municipality 3 industrial zones are namely in Elsenroth - Gaderoth and in Breunfeld. The most different companies are resident there.\n\nThe biggest [[employer]] in [[municipality]] is the SARSTEDT Verwaltungs AG with her factories in village Rommelsdorf and Winterborn. The company develops, produces and sells machines and consumable material for [[medicine]] and [[science]]. The setting up followed in the year 1961 and occupies nowadays 2,250 employees worldwide.\n\nJust as is the KABE LABORTECHNIK GmbH in Elsenroth a bigger medicine technology company.
