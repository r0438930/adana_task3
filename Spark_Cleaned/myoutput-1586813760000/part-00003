{"title_page": "Paycheck Protection Program", "text_new": "The '''Paycheck Protection Program''' ('''PPP''') is a $349-billion business loan program established by the [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] (CARES Act) to help small businesses keep paying their workers. The Paycheck Protection Program allows small businesses to apply for low-interest private loans to pay for their payroll and certain other costs. A PPP loan is approximately equal to 2.5 times the business' average monthly payroll costs. The loan proceeds may be used to cover the business' payroll costs, rent, interest, and utilities for eight weeks. The loan principle may partially or fully forgiven if the business keeps its employee counts and employee wages stable. The program is overseen by the [[United States Small Business Administration|U.S. Small Business Administration]]. \n\n==Purpose==\nThe purpose of the Paycheck Protection Program and loan forgiveness are to provide economic relief to small businesses that have been adversely impacted by the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|pandemic]].{{refn|{{cite web | url= https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/ |title= Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak |work= The White House |date= March 13, 2020 }} }}{{refn| name= action | {{cite web |last1= Rothenberg |first1= Pamela V. |last2= Hicks |first2= Jason C. |last3= Few |first3= Stephanie |date= April 10, 2020 |url= https://www.natlawreview.com/article/paycheck-protection-program-action-questions-about-loan-application-risks |title= The Paycheck Protection Program in Action: Questions About Loan Application Risks |work= National Law Review }} }}\n\n==Eligibility==\nIn order to be eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program, an applicant must be a small business, [[sole proprietor]], [[independent contractor]], [[self-employment|self-employed person]], [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]],{{efn|In the case of a church, a temple, a mosque, a synagogue, another house of worship, an integrated auxiliary of churches, or a convention or association of churches that is not required to apply for a determination of its 501(c)(3) status, the organization is eligible as long as it meets the requirements of Section 501(c)(3) and all other PPP requirements.{{refn|{{USCode|26|501|pipe=26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3)}}}}{{refn|{{USCode|26|508|pipe= 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 508(c)(1)(A)}} }} }} [[501(c)(19)]] veterans organization,{{refn| {{cite web |url= https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/veterans-organizations |title= Veterans' Organizations |work= [[Internal Revenue Service]] |date= January 8, 2020 }} }}{{refn| {{cite web| url= https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3386.pdf |title= Publication 3386: Tax Guide for Veterans' Organizations |work= Internal Revenue Service |date= April 2018 }} }} or a tribal business.{{efn|An tribal business is a business that is wholly owned by one or more [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Indian tribal government]]s or by a corporation that is wholly owned by one or more Indian tribal governments.
