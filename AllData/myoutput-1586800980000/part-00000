Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]] knew them as the nation descended from Magog the [[Japhetites|Japhetite]], as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and explained them to be the [[Scythians]]. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the [[Vikings]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongols]], [[Ural-Altaic race|Turanians]] or other [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]], or even the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israelites|Israel]].\n\nThe legend of Gog and Magog and the gates were also interpolated into the [[Alexander romance]]s. In one version, \"Goth and Magothy\" (that means Muralla in Maranaw people) are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in [[human cannibalism]] in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'', sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.\n\nThe conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian and Islamic era.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=123}} They appear in the [[Quran]] in chapter [[Al-Kahf]] as Yajuj and Majuj ({{Lang-ar|{{Nastaliq|\u064a\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c \u0648\u0645\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c}}}}; {{transl|ar|DIN|Ya\u02bej\u016bj wa-Ma\u02bej\u016bj}}), primitive and immoral tribes that were separated and barriered off by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (possessor of the Two Horns), who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and conqueror.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Many modern Muslim historians and geographers regarded the [[Vikings]] as the emergence of Gog and Magog.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4MjAQAAMAAJ&q=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&dq=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj40viCj_zkAhWHgVwKHRsQAaoQ6AEINzAC|title=Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe, A.D. 700-1100|first=P.

Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]] knew them as the nation descended from Magog the [[Japhetites|Japhetite]], as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and explained them to be the [[Scythians]]. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the [[Vikings]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongols]], [[Ural-Altaic race|Turanians]] or other [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]], or even the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israelites|Israel]].\n\nThe legend of Gog and Magog and the gates were also interpolated into the [[Alexander romance]]s. In one version, \"Goth and Magothy\" (that means Muralla in Maranaw people) are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in [[human cannibalism]] in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'', sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.\n\nThe conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian and Islamic era.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=123}} They appear in the [[Quran]] in chapter [[Al-Kahf]] as Yajuj and Majuj ({{Lang-ar|{{Nastaliq|\u064a\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c \u0648\u0645\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c}}}}; {{transl|ar|DIN|Ya\u02bej\u016bj wa-Ma\u02bej\u016bj}}), primitive and immoral tribes that were separated and barriered off by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (possessor of the Two Horns), who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and conqueror.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Many modern Muslim historians and geographers regarded the [[Vikings]] as the emergence of Gog and Magog.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4MjAQAAMAAJ&q=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&dq=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj40viCj_zkAhWHgVwKHRsQAaoQ6AEINzAC|title=Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe, A.D. 700-1100|first=P.
